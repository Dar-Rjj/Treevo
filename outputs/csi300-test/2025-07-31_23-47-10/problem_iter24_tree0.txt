High-Low Spread with Volume, Multi-Period Price Trends, and Dynamic Volatility with Adaptive Moving Averages and Macroeconomic Indicators
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Daily Volume Trend
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Calculate adaptive moving average over 10 days
│   └── Subtract today's volume from 10-day adaptive moving average
│       └── Determine if positive or negative trend
├── Calculate Short-Term Price Trend
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate EMA over 10 days
│       └── Subtract today's close from 10-day EMA
│           └── Determine if positive or negative trend
├── Calculate Medium-Term Price Trend
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate EMA over 30 days
│       └── Subtract today's close from 30-day EMA
│           └── Determine if positive or negative trend
├── Calculate Long-Term Price Trend
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate EMA over 50 days
│       └── Subtract today's close from 50-day EMA
│           └── Determine if positive or negative trend
├── Calculate Dynamic Volatility
│   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Calculate standard deviation over 10 days
│   └── Determine volatility score
│       ├── If Volatility is above 80th percentile, assign a score of 2.5
│       ├── If Volatility is between 60th and 80th percentile, assign a score of 1.5
│       ├── If Volatility is between 40th and 60th percentile, assign a score of 1.0
│       └── If Volatility is below 40th percentile, assign a score of 0.5
├── Integrate Momentum and Relative Strength
│   ├── Calculate Short-Term EMA (5 days)
│   └── Calculate Long-Term EMA (20 days)
│       └── Compute Relative Strength as (Short-Term EMA / Long-Term EMA)
├── Incorporate Adaptive Moving Averages
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate adaptive EMA over 10, 30, and 50 days
│       └── Adjust based on market volatility
├── Consider Macroeconomic Indicators
│   ├── Analyze GDP growth rate
│   │   ├── If GDP growth rate is positive, increase overall factor by 1.2
│   │   └── If GDP growth rate is negative, decrease overall factor by 0.8
│   ├── Analyze Inflation Rate
│   │   ├── If Inflation Rate is within target range, increase overall factor by 1.1
│   │   └── If Inflation Rate is outside target range, decrease overall factor by 0.9
│   ├── Analyze Interest Rates
│   │   ├── If Interest Rates are decreasing, increase overall factor by 1.3
│   │   └── If Interest Rates are increasing, decrease overall factor by 0.7
├── Combine Spread, Volume, Multi-Period Price Trends, and Volatility
│   ├── Adjust High-Low Spread by Volume Trend
│   │   ├── If Volume Trend is positive, multiply by 1.5
│   │   └── If Volume Trend is negative, multiply by 0.5
│   ├── Incorporate Short-Term Price Trend
│   │   ├── If Short-Term Price Trend is positive, multiply by 1.2
│   │   └── If Short-Term Price Trend is negative, multiply by 0.8
│   ├── Incorporate Medium-Term Price Trend
│   │   ├── If Medium-Term Price Trend is positive, multiply by 1.1
│   │   └── If Medium-Term Price Trend is negative, multiply by 0.9
│   ├── Incorporate Long-Term Price Trend
│   │   ├── If Long-Term Price Trend is positive, multiply by 1.3
│   │   └── If Long-Term Price Trend is negative, multiply by 0.7
│   ├── Incorporate Dynamic Volatility
│   │   ├── Multiply by the determined volatility score
│   └── Incorporate Momentum and Relative Strength
│       ├── If Relative Strength > 1, multiply by 1.7
│       └── If Relative Strength <= 1, multiply by 0
