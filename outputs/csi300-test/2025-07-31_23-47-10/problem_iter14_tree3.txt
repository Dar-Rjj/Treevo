High-Low Spread with Dynamic Volume Trend, Volatility, Price Momentum, Relative Strength, and Market Breadth
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Daily Volume Trend
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Calculate 10-day moving average of volume
│   └── Subtract today's volume from 10-day moving average
│       └── Determine if positive or negative trend
│           ├── If (today's volume - 10-day moving average) > 0, positive trend
│           └── If (today's volume - 10-day moving average) < 0, negative trend
├── Calculate Volatility
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate 20-day standard deviation of log returns
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate 5-day simple moving average of close prices
│       └── Subtract today's close from 5-day moving average
│           └── Determine if positive or negative momentum
│               ├── If (today's close - 5-day moving average) > 0, positive momentum
│               └── If (today's close - 5-day moving average) < 0, negative momentum
├── Calculate Relative Strength
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate ratio of current close to 252-day moving average
│       └── Interpretation: 
│           ├── Higher ratio indicates stronger relative performance
│           └── Lower ratio indicates weaker relative performance
├── Calculate Market Breadth
│   ├── Use Close prices of all stocks in the market
│   └── Calculate percentage of stocks above their 50-day moving average
│       └── Interpretation:
│           ├── Higher percentage indicates strong market breadth
│           └── Lower percentage indicates weak market breadth
├── Calculate Adaptive Moving Average
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate 10-day and 30-day exponential moving averages
│       ├── If 10-day EMA > 30-day EMA, bullish trend
│       └── If 10-day EMA < 30-day EMA, bearish trend
└── Combine Spread, Volume Trend, Volatility, Price Momentum, Relative Strength, and Market Breadth
    ├── Adjust High-Low Spread by Volume Trend
    │   ├── If Volume Trend is positive, multiply High-Low Spread by 1.5
    │   └── If Volume Trend is negative, multiply High-Low Spread by 0.5
    ├── Adjust for Price Momentum
    │   ├── If Price Momentum is positive, multiply adjusted spread by 1.2
    │   └── If Price Momentum is negative, multiply adjusted spread by 0.8
    ├── Incorporate Relative Strength
    │   ├── Multiply adjusted spread by relative strength ratio
    ├── Incorporate Market Breadth
    │   ├── If market breadth is strong, multiply by 1.1
    │   └── If market breadth is weak, multiply by 0.9
    ├── Incorporate Adaptive Moving Average
    │   ├── If 10-day EMA > 30-day EMA, multiply by 1.2
    │   └── If 10-day EMA < 30-day EMA, multiply by 0.8
    ├── Final Alpha Factor
    │   ├── Multiply adjusted spread by volatility
    │   └── Interpretation: 
    │       ├── Higher value indicates potential for higher returns
    │       └── Lower value indicates potential for lower returns
