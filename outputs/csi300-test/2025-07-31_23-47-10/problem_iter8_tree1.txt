High-Low Spread with Volume and Price Momentum
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Daily Volume Trend
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Calculate moving average over 10 days
│   └── Subtract today's volume from 10-day moving average
│       └── Determine if positive or negative trend
├── Incorporate Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close prices
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day percentage change
│   └── Adjust for momentum
│       ├── If 5-day % change is positive, multiply by 1.2
│       └── If 5-day % change is negative, multiply by 0.8
├── Combine High-Low Spread and Volume Trend
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Spread by Volume Trend
│   └── Adjust for positive and negative trends
│       ├── If Volume Trend is positive, multiply by 1.5
│       └── If Volume Trend is negative, multiply by 0.5
└── Incorporate Volatility Adjustment
    ├── Calculate 20-day Historical Volatility
    │   ├── Use Close prices
    │   │   └── Calculate standard deviation over 20 days
    │   └── Use the standard deviation as a measure of volatility
    └── Adjust for Volatility
        ├── If Volatility is high (above 2% threshold), multiply combined factor by 1.3
        └── If Volatility is low (below 2% threshold), multiply combined factor by 0.7
