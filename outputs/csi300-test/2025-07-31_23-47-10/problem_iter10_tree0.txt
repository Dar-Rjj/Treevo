High-Low Spread with Dynamic Volume Trend, Volatility, and Price Momentum
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Daily Volume Trend
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Calculate 10-day moving average of volume
│   └── Subtract today's volume from 10-day moving average
│       └── Determine if positive or negative trend
│           ├── If (today's volume - 10-day moving average) > 0, positive trend
│           └── If (today's volume - 10-day moving average) < 0, negative trend
├── Calculate Volatility
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate 20-day standard deviation of log returns
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate 5-day simple moving average of close prices
│       └── Subtract today's close from 5-day moving average
│           └── Determine if positive or negative momentum
│               ├── If (today's close - 5-day moving average) > 0, positive momentum
│               └── If (today's close - 5-day moving average) < 0, negative momentum
└── Combine Spread, Volume Trend, Volatility, and Price Momentum
    ├── Adjust High-Low Spread by Volume Trend
    │   ├── If Volume Trend is positive, multiply High-Low Spread by 1.5
    │   └── If Volume Trend is negative, multiply High-Low Spread by 0.5
    ├── Adjust for Price Momentum
    │   ├── If Price Momentum is positive, multiply adjusted spread by 1.2
    │   └── If Price Momentum is negative, multiply adjusted spread by 0.8
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── Multiply adjusted spread by volatility
        └── Interpretation: 
            ├── Higher value indicates potential for higher returns
            └── Lower value indicates potential for lower returns
