│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Daily Volume Trend
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Calculate moving average over 10 days
│   └── Subtract today's volume from 10-day moving average
│       └── Determine if positive or negative trend
├── Incorporate Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Daily Volatility
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Calculate standard deviation over 20 days
│   └── Normalize High-Low Spread by Daily Volatility
│       └── Divide High-Low Spread by Daily Volatility
├── Combine Spread and Volume Trend
│   ├── Multiply Normalized High-Low Spread by Volume Trend
│   └── Adjust for positive and negative trends
│       ├── If Volume Trend is positive, multiply by 1.5
