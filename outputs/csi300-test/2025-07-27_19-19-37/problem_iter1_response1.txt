```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the close and open prices
    diff_close_open = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate the average of high and low prices
    avg_high_low = (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2
    
    # Calculate the ratio of the difference to the average
    ratio = diff_close_open / (avg_high_low + 1e-7)
    
    # Calculate the change in volume

    # Combine the ratio with the volume change
