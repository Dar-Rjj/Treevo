Focus on dynamic volatility adjustments and advanced smoothing for reversal signals.
Subtract volatility, integrate reversal early, combine before non-linear transformations, smooth final factor.
Combine momentum with volatility adjustments earlier, then apply non-linear transformations for refined signals.
Incorporate more dynamic volatility measures and refine reversal signals with adaptive thresholds.
Subtract volatility, integrate reversal signals early, combine factors before non-linear transformations, and apply adaptive smoothing at the end.
Combine momentum and volume, apply volatility adjustment, then smooth and transform non-linearly for refined alpha.
Incorporate more robust volatility measures and dynamic adjustment of smoothing periods.
Incorporate adaptive smoothing, non-linear transformations, and adjust for volatility by division, not subtraction.
Simplify calculations, focus on key momentum and volatility adjustments, and enhance with adaptive smoothing.
Integrate more volatility adjustments and refine non-linear transformations for improved signal clarity.
