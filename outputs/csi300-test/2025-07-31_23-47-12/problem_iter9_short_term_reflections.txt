Integrate more dynamic thresholds, simplify final factor calculation, and enhance with market breadth and economic indicators.
Focus on dynamic weighting, cumulative log returns, and volume relative to mean for enhanced factor performance.
Incorporate dynamic volume ratios, refined volatility metrics, and validate each component for interpretability and effectiveness.
Simplify calculations, focus on adaptive weighting, and ensure components are clearly interpretable and novel.
Incorporate dynamic thresholds, EMA, IQR, and market breadth for more robust and adaptive factors.
Incorporate dynamic thresholds, mean volume adjustment, and ensure weights sum to 1 for stability.
Consider dynamic weighting, use moving averages for volume, and incorporate more sophisticated volatility measures.
Simplify by directly combining momentum and volatility, use clear, fixed weights, and ensure volume adjusts momentum effectively.
Simplify log returns, focus on robust volatility metrics, and integrate key economic indicators for enhanced interpretability.
Incorporate dynamic thresholds, advanced volatility metrics, and macroeconomic indicators for improved factor robustness and predictive power.
