High-Low Momentum with Volume Surge and Volatility Adjusted Indicator
├── Calculate High-Low Momentum
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Compute the difference between High and Low (High - Low)
│           └── Smooth using a 5-day moving average
├── Volume Surge Indicator
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Compute the percentage change in Volume from previous day
│   │       └── Determine if the percentage change exceeds a threshold (e.g., 10%)
├── Volatility Measure
│   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Calculate the standard deviation of the close prices over the past 20 days
└── Adaptive Threshold for Volume Surge
    ├── If Volatility is above a threshold (e.g., 2%)
    │   └── Set Volume Surge threshold to 15%
    └── If Volatility is below the threshold
        └── Set Volume Surge threshold to 10%
└── Combine High-Low Momentum, Volume Surge, and Volatility
    ├── If Volume Surge is True
    │   └── Multiply High-Low Momentum by (1 + 0.1 * Volatility)
    └── If Volume Surge is False
        └── Set the factor to 0
