Enhanced High-Low Momentum with Conditional Volume and Volatility
├── Calculate High-Low Momentum
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Compute the difference between High and Low (High - Low)
│           └── Smooth using a 5-day moving average
├── Calculate Daily Volatility
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Compute the standard deviation of Close prices over the last 5 days
└── Enhanced Volume Surge Indicator
    ├── Use Volume
    │   └── Compute the percentage change in Volume from the previous day
    │       └── Determine if the percentage change exceeds a threshold (e.g., 10%)
    └── Combine High-Low Momentum, Daily Volatility, and Volume Surge
        ├── If Volume Surge is True, use the High-Low Momentum value
        │   └── Multiply by the inverse of Daily Volatility
        └── If Volume Surge is False, set the factor to 0
