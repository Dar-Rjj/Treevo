Integrate momentum, volatility, and volume more dynamically; consider adaptive rolling windows.
Incorporate rolling averages, transaction amount, and adjust for volatility to refine alpha factor.
Incorporate weighted returns, dynamic volatility, and avoid over-normalization for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate liquidity, trend, and momentum with dynamic volatility adjustments for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate dynamic volatility, amount-weighted returns, and multi-term adjustments for improved factor robustness.
Simplify calculations, focus on key volatility, and integrate volume-weighted returns for improved interpretability and performance.
Incorporate sentiment, macroeconomic indicators, and sector-specific data for more robust, context-aware alpha factors.
Simplify adjustments, focus on key metrics, integrate amount-weighted returns later, use single-term volatility for clearer signals.
Incorporate more market dynamics, like liquidity and order flow, and use advanced statistical methods for volatility and trend adjustments.
Simplify calculations, integrate key metrics early, and normalize final factors for improved performance and interpretability.
