Thought: Construct Alpha Factors Using Raw OHLCV Data
- Subthought: Calculate Returns and Volatility
  - Subthought: Daily Return
    - Formula: (Close_t - Close_t-1) / Close_t-1
  - Subthought: Realized Volatility
    - Formula: sqrt(sum((log(Close_t / Close_t-1))^2) over n days)
- Subthought: Momentum Indicators
  - Subthought: Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Formula: (SMA_50 - SMA_200) / SMA_200, where SMA_x is the x-day simple moving average
  - Subthought: Price Relative to SMA
    - Formula: (Close_t - SMA_20) / SMA_20
- Subthought: Volume Indicators
  - Subthought: Volume Change
    - Formula: (Volume_t - Volume_t-1) / Volume_t-1
  - Subthought: Volume Relative to its SMA
    - Formula: (Volume_t - SMA_20_Volume) / SMA_20_Volume, where SMA_20_Volume is the 20-day simple moving average of volume
- Subthought: Technical Indicators Based on High-Low Spread
  - Subthought: High-Low Difference Over Time
    - Formula: (High_t - Low_t) / (High_t-1 - Low_t-1)
  - Subthought: High-Low Difference Over Close
    - Formula: (High_t - Low_t) / Close_t
- Subthought: Trading Range Analysis
  - Subthought: Percentage of Days in Upper Range
    - Formula: sum(1 if (High_t >= max(High_t-19, t-19)) else 0 over last 20 days) / 20
  - Subthought: Percentage of Days in Lower Range
    - Formula: sum(1 if (Low_t <= min(Low_t-19, t-19)) else 0 over last 20 days) / 20
- Subthought: Order Imbalance
  - Subthought: Volume Difference Between Up and Down Days
    - Formula: (sum(Volume_t * (Close_t > Close_t-1) over last 20 days) - sum(Volume_t * (Close_t < Close_t-1) over last 20 days)) / sum(Volume_t over last 20 days)
