        ├── Result from High-Low Price Momentum
        └── Adjust based on Volume and Amount Changes
            ├── If both Volume and Amount Changes are positive, amplify the factor
            ├── If only one of Volume or Amount Change is positive, apply a moderate adjustment
            ├── If both Volume and Amount Changes are negative, dampen the factor
            └── Introduce a smoothing factor using a weighted moving average of past 5 days' Volume and Amount Changes
                ├── Assign weights to each day (e.g., 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2)
                └── Calculate the weighted moving average
