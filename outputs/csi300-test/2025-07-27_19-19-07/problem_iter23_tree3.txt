Thought: Construct Advanced Alpha Factors Using OHLCV Data
- Subthought: Calculate Returns and Enhanced Volatility
  - Subthought: Daily Return
    - Formula: (Close_t - Close_t-1) / Close_t-1
  - Subthought: Realized Volatility
    - Formula: sqrt(sum((log(Close_t / Close_t-1))^2) over n days)
  - Subthought: Volume-Weighted High-Low Range
    - Use High price
    - Use Low price
    - Use Volume
- Subthought: Momentum Indicators with Volume-Weighted Adjustments
  - Subthought: Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Formula: (SMA_50 - SMA_200) / SMA_200, where SMA_x is the x-day simple moving average
  - Subthought: Price Relative to SMA
    - Formula: (Close_t - SMA_20) / SMA_20
  - Subthought: Volume-Adjusted Momentum
    - Multiply Volume-Weighted High-Low Range by Close-to-Previous Close Return
    - Smooth the Resulting Series
      - Apply Exponential Moving Average
        - Use a Specific Alpha
    - Adjust for Volume Trend
      - Calculate Volume Change
        - Formula: (Volume_t - Volume_t-1) / Volume_t-1
      - Final Factor Calculation
        - If Volume Change is positive, amplify the factor; otherwise, dampen
- Subthought: Intraday-Long-Term Components
  - Subthought: Intraday Return
    - Formula: (High_t - Low_t)
  - Subthought: Open-to-Close Return
    - Formula: (Open_t - Close_t)

    - Aggregate Volume over last 5 days
    - Average the aggregated volumes
  - Subthought: Long-Term Volume Trend
    - Aggregate Volume over last 20 days
    - Average the aggregated volumes
  - Subthought: Volume Trend Ratio
    - Use Short-Term Volume Trend
    - Divide by Long-Term Volume Trend
- Subthought: Combined Momentum and Volatility
  - Combine Momentum Components
    - Add Intraday Momentum
    - Add Long-Term Momentum
  - Compute Volatility Component
    - Standard Deviation of Intraday Returns
    - Standard Deviation of Open-to-Close Returns
  - Subtract Weighted Volatility
    - Use Combined Momentum and Volatility
- Subthought: Final Alpha Factor
  - Combine and Smooth Final Factor
    - Use Combined Momentum and Volatility
    - Apply Simple Moving Average
      - Use a Specific Window Size
  - Incorporate Intraday Price Reversal
    - Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum prices within the trading day
    - Subtract the Intraday Return
  - Add Aggregated High-Low Price Bandwidth
    - Sum bandwidths over last 5 days
  - Multiply by VWAP
    - Sum of (High + Low + Close) / 3
    - Multiply by Volume
    - Sum of Volumes
  - Add Smoothed and Volume-Adjusted Momentum Factor
    - Use Combined and Smoothed Final Factor
    - Apply Simple Moving Average
      - Use a Specific Window Size
