Incorporate rolling metrics, dynamic smoothing, and logarithmic transformation for enhanced stability and predictive power.
Simplify integration, use higher smoothing, and avoid unnecessary lagging for more direct and responsive factors.
Simplify feature integration, focus on core momentum and volatility, and optimize smoothing for clearer signals.
Incorporate lagged values, use moderate smoothing, and balance current and past data for stability.
Incorporate rolling metrics, dynamic smoothing, and logarithmic transformation for more robust and interpretable alpha factors.
Integrate lagged values, use dynamic smoothing, and balance current and past data for stability.
Incorporate rolling metrics and dynamic smoothing factors for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Incorporate rolling metrics, dynamic smoothing, and ensure positive values before transformations for more robust factors.
Incorporate rolling window for momentum, use natural logarithm, and add a small constant for positivity.
Focus on core integration of momentum and volatility; simplify adjustments and avoid overcomplicating with additional features.
