Incorporate rolling window momentum, adjust smoothing, and consider log transformation for stability.
Incorporate smoothing and logarithmic transformations for enhanced factor stability and interpretability.
Incorporate price trends, trading volume anomalies, and smooth data for noise reduction to enhance predictive power.
Incorporate exponential smoothing and logarithmic transformation for more robust, non-linear factor generation.
Integrate more market signals, fine-tune smoothing factor, and consider log transformation earlier.
Incorporate longer momentum periods, smoothing, and transformations for better predictive power and normalization.
Incorporate EMA for smoothing, integrate volume-weighted volatility with momentum, and apply exponential smoothing for better factor stability.
Increase smoothing factor for more weight on recent data; consider volatility normalized by close price.
Refine smoothing factor, integrate volume more dynamically, and consider additional momentum terms.
Incorporate smoothed momentum, consider additional price features, and explore alternative weighting methods for volatility.
