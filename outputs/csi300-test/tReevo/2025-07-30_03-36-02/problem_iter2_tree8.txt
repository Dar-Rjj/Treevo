Intraday Price and Volume Dynamics Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
│   ├── Use Open, High, Low, Close prices
│   │   └── Compute the average of these four prices
│   └── Multiply by Volume
│       └── Sum over N periods
└── Adjust for Volume Synchronization
    ├── Calculate Volume-to-Price Volatility Ratio
    │   ├── Aggregate Volume over N periods
    │   │   └── Use Volume
    │   └── Calculate Price Range over N periods
    │       ├── Use High price
    │       └── Use Low price
    │           └── Compute average high-low range
    ├── Compare Volume-to-Price Volatility Ratio with its Moving Average
    │   ├── Compute Moving Average of Volume-to-Price Volatility Ratio
    │   │   └── Use previous N periods
    │   └── Subtract Moving Average from Current Ratio
    └── Combine with Intraday High-Low Spread
        ├── Weighted by Synchronization Signal
        │   ├── Positive if synchronization is increasing
        │   │   └── If (Current Ratio - Moving Average) > 0
        │   └── Negative if synchronization is decreasing
        └── Multiply High-Low Spread by Synchronization Signal
