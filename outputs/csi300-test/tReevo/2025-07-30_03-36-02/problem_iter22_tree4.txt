Intraday Volatility-Volume and Momentum Integration with Dynamic Smoothing and Rolling Metrics
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
│   └── Assign result to Intraday Volatility
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply Intraday Volatility by Volume
│       └── Assign result to Weighted Volatility
├── Calculate Intraday Momentum
│   ├── Compute Daily Close-Open Difference
│   │   ├── Subtract Open price from Close price
│   │   └── Assign result to Close-Open Difference
│   └── Sum of Close-Open Differences over a Rolling Window
│       ├── Define Short-Term Rolling Window (e.g., 5 days)
│       ├── Define Long-Term Rolling Window (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate Short-Term Rolling Sum
│       ├── Calculate Long-Term Rolling Sum
│       └── Assign results to Intraday Momentum (Short-Term and Long-Term)
├── Integrate Momentum and Volatility
│   ├── Sum Weighted Volatility and Intraday Momentum (Short-Term and Long-Term separately)
│   └── Apply Dynamic Exponential Smoothing
│       ├── Define Short-Term Smoothing Factor (e.g., 0.8)
│       ├── Define Long-Term Smoothing Factor (e.g., 0.95)
│       ├── Apply Exponential Smoothing Formula for Short-Term
│       └── Apply Exponential Smoothing Formula for Long-Term
│           └── Assign results to Smoothed Value (Short-Term and Long-Term)
├── Ensure Values are Positive
│   └── Add a Small Constant to Avoid Log of Zero or Negative
│       └── Assign result to Positive Smoothed Value (Short-Term and Long-Term)
├── Apply Logarithmic Transformation
│   └── Take Logarithm of the Positive Smoothed Value
│       └── Assign result to Log Transformed Value (Short-Term and Long-Term)
