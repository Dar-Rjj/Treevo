Simplify integration steps, fix smoothing factor, prioritize positivity before smoothing, and consider more robust volatility measures.
Simplify calculations, use dynamic smoothing early, and ensure positive values before transformations.
Simplify integration, use fixed smoothing, ensure positivity, apply logarithmic transformation.
Incorporate more price levels, use adaptive smoothing, and consider sector-specific momentum.
Simplify, focus on core momentum and volatility, and maintain a fixed smoothing factor for consistency.
Incorporate trading volume trends and adjust smoothing factor dynamically for better performance.
Simplify integration, focus on core signals, and optimize smoothing for better performance.
Incorporate dynamic smoothing, rolling metrics, and ensure positive values for logarithmic transformation.
Consider incorporating more dynamic adjustments and additional market indicators for enhanced predictive power.
Integrate momentum and volatility earlier, apply smoothing, then transform logarithmically for better factor performance.
