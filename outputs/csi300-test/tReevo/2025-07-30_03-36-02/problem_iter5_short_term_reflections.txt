Weight volatility and momentum separately, then integrate. Consider using open prices for more accurate momentum.
Integrate more price dynamics, consider average prices, and explore exponential smoothing for momentum.
Incorporate relative strength, moving averages, and adjust for market volatility in your heuristics.
Incorporate volume-weighted intraday volatility with momentum, and consider additional price levels for a more robust factor.
Incorporate recent price trends and liquidity for more predictive alpha factors.
Incorporate intraday volatility, adjust momentum by volume, and consider multiple lookback periods for more robust signals.
Incorporate past data, use volatility and momentum, and adjust for volume to enhance predictive power.
Incorporate momentum, adjust by volume, and apply non-linear transformations for more predictive alpha factors.
Integrate volume with volatility, use open and close for momentum, then sum for a combined factor.
Integrate price changes with volume, focus on volatility and momentum, and avoid complex, non-essential calculations.
