Simplify integration, focus on direct relationships, and optimize smoothing for clearer signals.
Incorporate multiple rolling windows and adaptive smoothing factors for enhanced factor robustness.
Incorporate multiple rolling windows and adaptive smoothing factors for enhanced momentum and volatility integration.
Incorporate rolling metrics, dynamic smoothing, and positive value adjustments for enhanced factor stability and predictive power.
Ensure positivity before smoothing, integrate features early, and consider adaptive smoothing factors.
Focus on adaptive smoothing, incorporate trading volume, and explore different rolling window sizes for momentum.
Simplify integration, apply smoothing to combined metrics, and ensure positivity before transformations.
Integrate more granular rolling metrics, optimize smoothing factors, and consider adding a mean reversion component.
Integrate weighted volatility and momentum before smoothing, ensure positivity, then apply logarithmic transformation.
Combine momentum and volatility before smoothing; use a consistent rolling window for integration.
