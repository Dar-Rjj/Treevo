Volume-Weighted Forward Close-to-Open Return with Enhanced Volume Weighting
├── Calculate Forward Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Next Day's Open price (day t+1)
│       └── Subtract Close from Next Day's Open
├── Enhanced Volume Weighting
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   ├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Volume over a Fixed Window (e.g., 20 days)
│   └── Adjust Volume by Dividing it by the EMA of Volume
│       └── Multiply by Forward Close-to-Open Return
└── Rolling Statistics
    ├── Calculate Rolling Mean of Volume-Weighted Forward Close-to-Open Return
    │   └── Use a Fixed Window (e.g., 20 days)
    └── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Forward Close-to-Open Return
        └── Use a Fixed Window (e.g., 20 days)
