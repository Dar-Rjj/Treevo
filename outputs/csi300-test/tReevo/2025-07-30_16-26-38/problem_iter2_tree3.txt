Adaptive Volume-Weighted Cumulative High-to-Low Range with Volatility Adjustment
├── Calculate Day’s High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Subtract Low price
├── Calculate Previous Days’ High-to-Low Range Cumulatively
│   ├── Sum of Last N Days' High-to-Low Ranges
│   └── N is an adaptive rolling window size (e.g., 5, 10, 20)
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Average of Open and Close Prices
│   ├── Use Open price
│   ├── Use Close price
│   ├── Add Open and Close
│   └── Divide by 2
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Cumulative High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Multiply Cumulative High-to-Low Range by Volume-Weighted Average
│   └── Use Volume
├── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation of Daily High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use High-to-Low Range
│   └── Adaptive Rolling Window Size
├── Adjust for Volatility
│   ├── Divide Volume-Adjusted Cumulative High-to-Low Range by Rolling Standard Deviation
└── Signal Generation
    ├── If > 0, Positive Signal
