Volume Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Dynamic Volatility Adjustment and Additional Price Features
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Next Day's Open price (day t+1)
│       └── Subtract Close from Next Day's Open
├── Volume Weighting
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Adaptive Window Calculation
│   ├── Determine Volatility
│   │   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices of day t
│   │   └── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation over a Fixed Initial Window
│   └── Adjust Window Size
│       ├── If Volatility is High, Decrease Window Size
│       └── If Volatility is Low, Increase Window Size
└── Rolling Statistics
    ├── Calculate Rolling Mean of Volume Weighted Close-to-Open Return
    │   └── Use Adaptive Window
    └── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation of Volume Weighted Close-to-Open Return
        └── Use Adaptive Window
├── Incorporate Additional Price Features
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   │   ├── Use High and Low prices of day t
│   │   └── Subtract Low from High
│   └── Calculate High-Close Spread
│       ├── Use High and Close prices of day t
│       └── Subtract Close from High
├── Dynamic Volatility Adjustment
│   ├── Calculate Volatility Ratio
│   │   ├── Use Rolling Standard Deviation of Close prices
│   │   └── Divide by Average of Rolling Standard Deviations
│   ├── Adjust Close-to-Open Return
│   │   ├── If Volatility Ratio is High, Down-weight Close-to-Open Return
│   │   └── If Volatility Ratio is Low, Up-weight Close-to-Open Return
│   └── Adjust Volume Weighted Close-to-Open Return
│       ├── Apply Volatility-Adjusted Close-to-Open Return
│       └── Recalculate Volume Weighting
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Rolling Mean and Standard Deviation
    │   ├── Use Adaptive Window
    │   └── Weight by Volatility-Adjusted Factors
    └── Incorporate Additional Price Features
        ├── Include High-Low and High-Close Spreads
        └── Weight by Volatility-Adjusted Factors
