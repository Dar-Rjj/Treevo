Volume Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Adaptive Windows and Volatility Adjustment
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t+1
│       └── Subtract Close from Next Day's Open
├── Volume Weighting
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Determine Volatility
│   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices of day t
│   └── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation over a Fixed Window (e.g., 20 days)
├── Adjust Window Size Based on Volatility
│   ├── If Volatility is High, Decrease Window Size
│   └── If Volatility is Low, Increase Window Size
└── Calculate Rolling Statistics with Adaptive Window
    ├── Calculate Rolling Mean of Volume Weighted Close-to-Open Return
    │   └── Use Adaptive Window
    └── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation of Volume Weighted Close-to-Open Return
        └── Use Adaptive Window
