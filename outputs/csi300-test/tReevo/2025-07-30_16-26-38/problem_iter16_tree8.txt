Volume Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Adaptive Volatility and Dynamic Window Sizing
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Next Day's Open price (day t+1)
│       └── Subtract Close from Next Day's Open
├── Volume Weighting
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Determine Volatility
│   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices
│   └── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation over a Fixed Window (e.g., 20 days)
├── Adjust Window Size Based on Volatility
│   ├── If Volatility is High, Decrease Window Size
│   │   └── Use a smaller window (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── If Volatility is Low, Increase Window Size
│       └── Use a larger window (e.g., 30 days)
├── Market Regime Detection
│   ├── Identify Market Regimes using a combination of High, Low, and Close prices
│   └── Assign a regime label (e.g., Bullish, Bearish, Sideways)
└── Rolling Statistics
    ├── Calculate Rolling Mean of Volume Weighted Close-to-Open Return
    │   └── Use Adaptive Window based on Volatility
    └── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation of Volume Weighted Close-to-Open Return
        └── Use Adaptive Window based on Volatility
