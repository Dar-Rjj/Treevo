Intraday Volatility Adjusted Return with Adaptive Weighting
├── Calculate Intraday Range
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price of day t
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Subtract Open price of day t+1 from Close price of day t
│   └── Divide by Close price of day t
├── Combine Intraday Range and Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Divide Close-to-Open Return by Intraday Range
├── Apply Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) to Intraday Range
│   ├── Select a span for EWMA (e.g., 20 days)
│   └── Compute EWMA of Intraday Range
├── Adjust Factor Value with Adaptive Weighting
│   ├── Use the EWMA of Intraday Range as the adaptive weight
│   └── Multiply the combined factor value by the adaptive weight
└── Final Factor Value
    ├── The adjusted factor value from the previous step
