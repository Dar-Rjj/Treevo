Vary weights, smoothing parameters, and explore adding new momentum or volume-based factors.
Integrate more volume-adjusted metrics and optimize weights for smoother, more predictive factors.
Optimize weights, smoothing factors, and consider incorporating more price and volume derivatives.
Incorporate dynamic weighting, adaptive smoothing, and consider adding more sophisticated volume and volatility measures.
Integrate dynamic weighting, volume-weighted returns, and longer aggregation periods for enhanced factor performance.
Incorporate adaptive weights and exponential smoothing for more dynamic, responsive alpha factors.
Focus on dynamic weighting, use more SMA periods, and integrate more volume-adjusted momentum factors.
Normalize, weight, and smooth factors carefully; consider dynamic weighting and multi-period aggregation for improved performance.
Simplify components, use fixed weights, and apply consistent exponential smoothing for better performance.
Focus on dynamic weighting, use more robust smoothing, and consider additional volume-adjusted momentum factors.
