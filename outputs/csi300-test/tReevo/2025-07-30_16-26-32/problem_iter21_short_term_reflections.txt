Incorporate adaptive weights, use EMA for smoothing, and integrate volume more deeply with momentum and volatility.
Use fixed weights, simple moving averages, and normalize by average volume for more robust and interpretable factors.
Incorporate dynamic weighting, use exponential smoothing, and integrate volume-adjusted returns for enhanced factor performance.
Normalize by opening price, simplify factors, and rebalance weights for improved predictive power.
Normalize and smooth data more effectively; adjust weights based on historical performance.
Incorporate dynamic weighting, use exponential smoothing, and integrate volume-weighted metrics for improved factor performance.
Normalize ranges, adjust weights, and smooth with exponential moving averages for improved factor performance.
Incorporate adaptive weights, normalize by open price, and use market sentiment for more responsive and context-aware alpha factors.
Incorporate liquidity, leverage technical indicators, and adjust weights dynamically based on market conditions.
Normalize ranges, dynamically adjust weights, and apply exponential smoothing for improved factor performance.
