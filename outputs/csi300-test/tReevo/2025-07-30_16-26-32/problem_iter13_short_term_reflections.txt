Fix alphas, balance weights, and consider dynamic period adjustments for more adaptability.
Use fixed weights, exponential smoothing, and aggregate over longer periods for stability.
Fix weights improve consistency; dynamic weights need robust market context indicators.
Adjust weights, incorporate more volume trends, and consider using different smoothing techniques for enhanced factor performance.
Incorporate adaptive weights, multi-period analysis, and integrate more volume-based features.
Incorporate adaptive weighting, dynamic smoothing, and additional trend-following components for improved performance.
Refine weights, incorporate more price/volume features, and experiment with different smoothing techniques.
Adjust weights, use longer smoothing periods, and consider adding market trend indicators.
Incorporate dynamic weights, multi-period smoothing, and consider recent market and volume trends for better adaptability.
Refine weights, incorporate more price and volume derivatives, and consider market conditions for dynamic adjustments.
