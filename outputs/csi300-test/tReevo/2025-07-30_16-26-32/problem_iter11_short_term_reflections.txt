Incorporate more dynamic weighting, use adaptive smoothing, and consider additional market sentiment indicators.
Simplify calculations, assign specific weights, and use exponential smoothing for more effective factor combination.
Simplify smoothing, use fixed weights, and aggregate factors with exponential smoothing for better performance.
Simplify smoothing, use SMA over EWMA, and reduce adaptive parameters for more robust and interpretable factors.
Simplify smoothing, use SMA instead of EWMA, and consistently apply exponential smoothing with fixed alpha.
Incorporate more specific price and volume features, use dynamic weights, and consider multi-period smoothing.
Refine weights, use dynamic smoothing, and incorporate more recent data for better factor performance.
Incorporate more recent data, dynamic weighting, and advanced smoothing techniques for improved factor performance.
Incorporate more refined volume and price trends, use dynamic weights, and consider market context for better factor performance.
Simplify smoothing, use fixed weights, and avoid over-adjusting based on market sentiment for more robust factors.
