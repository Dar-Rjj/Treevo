Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread, Trend Strength, and Volatility
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Use Low price of day t
│       ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Spread by Volume of day t
├── Compute 10-Day Weighted Moving Average
│   ├── Collect Weighted High-Low Spreads (Last 10 days)
│   └── Calculate Sum over 10 Days
├── Compute 50-Day Weighted Moving Average
│   ├── Collect Weighted High-Low Spreads (Last 50 days)
│   └── Calculate Sum over 50 Days
├── Calculate 10-Day Simple Moving Average of Close Prices
│   ├── Collect Close prices (Last 10 days)
│   └── Calculate Average over 10 Days
├── Calculate 50-Day Simple Moving Average of Close Prices
│   ├── Collect Close prices (Last 50 days)
│   └── Calculate Average over 50 Days
├── Trend Strength Indicator
│   ├── Subtract 50-Day SMA from 10-Day SMA
│   └── If Result > 0, then Bullish, Else Bearish
├── Volatility Indicator
│   ├── Calculate Standard Deviation of High-Low Spreads (Last 10 days)
└── Composite Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Trend Strength and Volatility
    │   ├── If Bullish, Multiply by (1 + Volatility)
    │   └── If Bearish, Multiply by (1 - Volatility)
    ├── Incorporate Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
    │   ├── Add 10-Day Weighted Moving Average
    │   └── Subtract 50-Day Weighted Moving Average
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── Combine All Components
        │   ├── Multiply Combined Trend and Volatility by Adjusted Spread
        └── Output Final Alpha Factor
