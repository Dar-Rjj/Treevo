Thought: Consider trend, momentum, and volume indicators; integrate multi-day patterns, volatility, and market sentiment for more robust factors.
  Thought: Trend Indicators
    Thought: Moving Average Crossover
      Sub-thought: Calculate 5-day and 20-day moving averages of close prices.
      Sub-thought: Subtract the 20-day MA from the 5-day MA to get a trend signal.
    Thought: Price Change Over Period
      Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in close price over a 20-day period.
      Sub-thought: Use this as a simple trend indicator.
  Thought: Momentum Indicators
    Thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
      Sub-thought: Calculate the average gain and average loss over the last 14 days.
      Sub-thought: Compute RSI using the formula: 100 - (100 / (1 + (average gain / average loss))).
    Thought: Rate of Change (ROC)
      Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in close price from today to the same day n periods ago.
      Sub-thought: Use different n values (e.g., 10, 20) to capture different momentum periods.
  Thought: Volume Indicators
    Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
      Sub-thought: Initialize OBV at 0.
      Sub-thought: For each day, if the close price is higher than the previous close, add the volume to OBV.
      Sub-thought: If the close price is lower than the previous close, subtract the volume from OBV.
      Sub-thought: If the close price is equal to the previous close, do not change OBV.
    Thought: Volume Change
      Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume from the previous day.
      Sub-thought: This can indicate increasing or decreasing interest in the stock.
  Thought: Multi-Day Patterns
    Thought: Price Pattern - Bullish Engulfing
      Sub-thought: Identify a pattern where the open price on day t is below the close price on day t-1, and the close price on day t is above the open price on day t-1.
    Thought: Price Pattern - Bearish Engulfing
      Sub-thought: Identify a pattern where the open price on day t is above the close price on day t-1, and the close price on day t is below the open price on day t-1.
    Thought: Volume Spike with Price Movement
      Sub-thought: Identify days where the volume is significantly higher than the average volume over the past 20 days.
      Sub-thought: Check if the close price on such days is higher or lower than the previous close to determine the direction of the spike.
  Thought: Volatility Indicators
    Thought: Bollinger Bands
      Sub-thought: Calculate the 20-day moving average of the close price.
      Sub-thought: Calculate the 20-day standard deviation of the close price.
      Sub-thought: Compute the upper band as the 20-day MA plus 2 times the 20-day standard deviation.
      Sub-thought: Compute the lower band as the 20-day MA minus 2 times the 20-day standard deviation.
      Sub-thought: Use the upper and lower bands to identify high and low volatility periods.
    Thought: Average True Range (ATR)
      Sub-thought: Calculate the true range for each day as the maximum of the current high minus the current low, the absolute value of the current high minus the previous close, and the absolute value of the current low minus the previous close.
      Sub-thought: Compute the ATR as the 14-day exponential moving average of the true range.
      Sub-thought: Use ATR to measure the volatility of the stock.
  Thought: Market Sentiment Indicators
    Thought: Sentiment Score
      Sub-thought: Collect news or social media mentions related to the stock.
      Sub-thought: Assign a sentiment score based on the tone of the mentions (positive, negative, neutral).
      Sub-thought: Aggregate the scores over a recent period (e.g., 7 days) to get a sentiment index.
    Thought: Put-Call Ratio
      Sub-thought: Obtain the daily put and call option volumes for the stock.
      Sub-thought: Calculate the put-call ratio as the number of put options divided by the number of call options.
      Sub-thought: Use the put-call ratio to gauge market sentiment (higher ratio indicates bearish sentiment, lower ratio indicates bullish sentiment).
