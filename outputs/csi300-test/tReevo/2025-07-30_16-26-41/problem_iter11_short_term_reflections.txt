Simplify, focus on dynamic weighted averages, and integrate volume more effectively for enhanced predictive power.
Integrate sentiment, refine momentum periods, and adjust for dynamic volume trends.
Simplify, focus on dynamic short-term momentum, and effectively integrate volume for more responsive, less noisy factors.
Focus on short-term momentum, adjust for volatility, and simplify calculations for more interpretable and effective alpha factors.
Incorporate short-term momentum, use exponential weighting, and consider volume spikes for better factor performance.
Incorporate longer-term trends, blend multi-period metrics, and adjust for recent volatility and volume.
Incorporate both long and short-term trends, adjust for volatility, and weigh by average volume for robustness.
Incorporate shorter-term momentum, adjust for recent volatility, and weight by average volume for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate both long and short-term dynamics, adjust for volatility, and weigh by volume for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate longer trends, blend short and long-term metrics, and leverage volume for more robust, dynamic factors.
