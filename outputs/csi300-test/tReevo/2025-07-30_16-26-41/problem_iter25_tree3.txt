- Generate novel and interpretable alpha factors
  - Adaptive Volatility
    - Calculate daily return volatility using high, low, close prices
      - Use ATR (Average True Range) for volatility measure
      - Use standard deviation of daily returns as a secondary measure
    - Incorporate rolling window to adapt to recent market conditions
      - Use a 20-day rolling window for short-term volatility
      - Use a 50-day rolling window for medium-term volatility
      - Use a 200-day rolling window for long-term volatility
  - Dynamic Weights
    - Adjust weights based on recent performance
      - Calculate momentum score using past 12-month returns
      - Use exponential moving average (EMA) to weight recent performance more heavily
        - Use EMA with span 12 for the momentum score
      - Rebalance weights monthly or quarterly
    - Incorporate sector rotation
      - Assign higher weights to sectors with strong recent performance
      - Use relative strength of sectors to determine weights
  - Liquidity
    - Use volume and amount to measure liquidity
      - Calculate daily turnover ratio (volume / outstanding shares)
      - Use dollar volume (price * volume) as a liquidity proxy
    - Penalize stocks with low liquidity
      - Reduce weights for stocks with low turnover ratio
      - Reduce weights for stocks with low dollar volume
  - Multi-Period Momentum
    - Calculate momentum over multiple periods
      - Use 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month momentum
      - Combine different period momentums using a weighted average
        - Use equal weighting for simplicity
        - Use machine learning to dynamically adjust weights
  - Volume-Weighted Trend and Momentum Patterns
    - Calculate volume-weighted price trend
      - Use (close - open) * volume to weight the price change
      - Sum the volume-weighted price changes over a specified period
        - Use a 20-day and 50-day rolling window
    - Identify significant trend and momentum patterns
      - Use moving averages to identify trends
        - 50-day moving average for short-term trend
        - 200-day moving average for long-term trend
      - Use RSI (Relative Strength Index) to identify overbought/oversold conditions
        - Use a 14-day RSI
  - Machine Learning for Weight Adjustments
    - Use historical data to train a model for weight adjustments
      - Use a simple linear regression model
      - Use a more complex model like a decision tree or random forest
    - Incorporate macroeconomic indicators
      - Use GDP growth, inflation rates, and interest rates as input features
      - Use the model to predict future stock returns and adjust weights accordingly
