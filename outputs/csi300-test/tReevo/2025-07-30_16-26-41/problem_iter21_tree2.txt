- Novel and Interpretable Alpha Factor Construction
  - Short-term Momentum Analysis
    - Calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
    - Subtract the SMA from the current closing price to capture recent momentum
  - Adaptive Volatility Measure
    - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a recent short window (e.g., 10 days)
    - Use this standard deviation as a measure of volatility, higher values indicating more unpredictable market conditions
  - Volume Trend Indicator
    - Compute the ratio of the current volume to the average volume over the past n days (e.g., 20 days) to identify significant trading activity changes
    - A high ratio suggests a strong trend continuation or reversal depending on the price action
  - Dynamic Weight Adjustment
    - Assign weights to each component (momentum, volatility, and volume trend) based on their relative importance
      - For example, in a highly volatile market, decrease the weight of momentum and increase the weight of volatility
    - Adjust these weights dynamically based on the observed market conditions, possibly using a simple rule-based or machine learning model trained with historical data
  - Incorporate EMA for Smoothing
    - Calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the combined factor score to smooth out noise and emphasize the signal
  - Liquidity Consideration
    - Multiply the final alpha factor by a liquidity adjustment term, which is the inverse of the average spread between high and low prices over the last m days (e.g., 30 days)
    - This ensures that stocks with lower liquidity are less attractive, reducing risk
  - Final Alpha Factor Synthesis
    - Combine all elements into a single composite score:
        - Composite Score = (Momentum * Momentum Weight + Volatility * Volatility Weight + Volume Trend * Volume Trend Weight) * EMA * Liquidity Adjustment
    - The resulting composite score serves as the novel and interpretable alpha factor for predicting future stock returns
