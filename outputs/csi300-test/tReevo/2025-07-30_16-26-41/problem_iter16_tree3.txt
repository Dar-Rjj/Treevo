- Combine short- and long-term momentum with volume-weighted exponential smoothing
  - Short-term momentum
    - Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of close prices over an adaptive short period
      - Determine the short-term window size based on recent market conditions (e.g., 5 or 10 days)
      - Calculate the return from the current close price to the SMA
  - Long-term momentum
    - Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of close prices over an adaptive long period
      - Determine the long-term window size based on recent market conditions (e.g., 20 or 50 days)
      - Calculate the return from the current close price to the SMA
  - Volume-weighted exponential smoothing
    - Apply exponential smoothing to the close prices, using volume as the weight
      - Weight = volume / sum(volume in the window)
      - Smoothed price = alpha * (current close price * weight) + (1 - alpha) * (previous smoothed price)
- Adjust for volatility
  - Calculate the standard deviation of close prices over a fixed window (e.g., 20 days)
  - Scale the combined momentum by the inverse of the standard deviation
- Incorporate sentiment
  - Use the difference between the high and low prices as a proxy for intraday sentiment
    - Intraday sentiment score = (High Price - Low Price) / Open Price
  - Adjust the combined momentum by adding or subtracting the intraday sentiment score
- Prioritize recent, liquidity-adjusted data
  - Give higher weights to more recent data in the calculations
  - Adjust the momentum calculations by considering the ratio of current volume to the average volume
    - Liquidity adjustment factor = Current Volume / Average Volume
    - Adjusted momentum = Momentum * Liquidity Adjustment Factor
- Simplify calculations for clarity
  - Combine the adjusted momentum, volatility, and sentiment factors into a single, interpretable alpha factor
  - Ensure the alpha factor is easy to understand and implement
  - Final alpha factor: (Adjusted Short-term Momentum + Adjusted Long-term Momentum) * (1 / Volatility) * (1 + Intraday Sentiment Score)
