- Integrate dynamic, volume-weighted momentum with adaptive volatility
  - Volume-Weighted Momentum Calculation
    - Calculate the sum of (close price * volume) over the last n days
    - Calculate the sum of volume over the last n days
    - Divide the sum of (close price * volume) by the sum of volume to get the volume-weighted close price
    - Subtract the volume-weighted close price from n days ago to get the volume-weighted momentum
  - Adaptive Volatility Calculation
    - Calculate the standard deviation of the log returns over the last m days
    - Adjust the volume-weighted momentum by the adaptive volatility
      - Divide the volume-weighted momentum by the standard deviation of the log returns
- Use sector-specific EMA and liquidity adjustments
  - Sector-Specific EMA
    - Apply exponential moving average (EMA) to the close price for each sector
    - Use a fixed smoothing factor (e.g., 0.2)
    - Calculate the EMA for the last k days
  - Liquidity Adjustment
    - Calculate the average volume over the last p days
    - Divide the volume-weighted momentum by the average volume
- Simplify with fixed weights
  - Assign fixed weights to the volume-weighted momentum, adaptive volatility, sector-specific EMA, and liquidity adjustment
  - Combine the weighted factors into a single alpha factor
- Focus on short-term responsiveness
  - Use shorter time windows for momentum and volatility calculations
  - Adjust the EMA period to be relatively short
- Avoid overfitting
  - Use simple and interpretable parameters
  - Minimize the number of parameters
  - Ensure the model is not overly complex
