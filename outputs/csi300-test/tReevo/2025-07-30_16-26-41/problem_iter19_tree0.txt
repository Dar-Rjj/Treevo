- Combine Sentiment, Sector Performance, and News Impact
  - Sentiment Analysis
    - Analyze daily sentiment scores from social media and news articles
    - Calculate the average sentiment score over a rolling window
  - Sector Performance
    - Calculate the average return of the sector to which the stock belongs
    - Use a rolling window to capture recent sector performance
  - News Impact
    - Count the number of news articles related to the company or industry
    - Assign a positive or negative score based on the news content
    - Calculate the net impact score as the sum of these scores over a rolling window
  - Adaptive EMA Windows
    - Use Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for smoothing the sentiment, sector performance, and news impact scores
    - Adapt the EMA window size based on recent market volatility
      - Calculate the standard deviation of returns over a short-term period
      - Adjust the EMA window size inversely proportional to the standard deviation
  - Volume-Weighted Metrics
    - Calculate volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
    - Use VWAP as a reference for the closing price
    - Calculate the difference between the closing price and VWAP
  - Dynamic Factor Weighting
    - Assign weights to each factor (sentiment, sector performance, news impact, VWAP difference) based on their historical predictive power
    - Update the weights dynamically based on recent performance
  - Balance Short and Long-Term Factors
    - Combine short-term (e.g., 10-day) and long-term (e.g., 50-day) factors
    - Use a weighted average to balance the contributions of short and long-term factors
  - Exponential Smoothing
    - Apply exponential smoothing to the combined alpha factor
    - Use a smoothing factor (alpha) to control the weight of recent data
  - Final Alpha Factor
    - Sum the weighted and smoothed values of all the components
    - The final alpha factor is an interpretable score that could help predict future stock returns
