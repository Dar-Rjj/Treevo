Thought: Integrate Dynamic Windows, Volume-Weighted Metrics, and Exponential Smoothing
    Sub-Thought: Dynamic Windows
        Sub-Thought: Short-Term Momentum
            Action: Calculate the short-term (e.g., 5-day) moving average of the close prices.
            Action: Calculate the short-term (e.g., 5-day) exponential moving average (EMA) of the close prices.
        Sub-Thought: Long-Term Momentum
            Action: Calculate the long-term (e.g., 20-day) moving average of the close prices.
            Action: Calculate the long-term (e.g., 20-day) exponential moving average (EMA) of the close prices.
    Sub-Thought: Volume-Weighted Metrics
        Sub-Thought: Volume-Weighted Close Price
            Action: Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) over a period (e.g., 10 days).
            Action: Calculate the ratio of the current close price to the VWAP.
        Sub-Thought: Volume-Weighted Moving Average
            Action: Calculate the volume-weighted moving average (VWMA) of the close prices over a period (e.g., 10 days).
            Action: Calculate the ratio of the current close price to the VWMA.
    Sub-Thought: Exponential Smoothing
        Sub-Thought: Exponential Volatility
            Action: Calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) of the high-low range over a period (e.g., 10 days).
            Action: Calculate the ratio of the current high-low range to the EMA of the high-low range.
        Sub-Thought: Exponential Momentum
            Action: Calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) of the close price changes over a period (e.g., 10 days).
            Action: Calculate the ratio of the current close price change to the EMA of the close price changes.
    Sub-Thought: Liquidity and Market Conditions
        Sub-Thought: Volume Trend
            Action: Calculate the trend of the volume over a period (e.g., 10 days) using a simple moving average.
            Action: Calculate the ratio of the current volume to the moving average of the volume.
        Sub-Thought: Recent Market Conditions
            Action: Calculate the ratio of the current close price to the highest high and lowest low over a recent period (e.g., 5 days).
            Action: Calculate the percentage change in close price over a recent period (e.g., 5 days).
