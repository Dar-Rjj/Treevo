- Explore liquidity, dynamic volatility, and volume adjustments
  - Develop a liquidity factor
    - Calculate the average of (high - low) / close over a lookback period
    - Incorporate the difference between high and low volume days
  - Construct a dynamic volatility measure
    - Use the standard deviation of daily returns over a short-term and long-term window
    - Adjust for volume: multiply by the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the lookback period
  - Create a volume-adjusted return factor
    - Calculate the cumulative return over a lookback period
    - Multiply by the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the lookback period
- Balance short- and long-term momentum
  - Develop a short-term momentum factor
    - Calculate the cumulative return over a short-term window (e.g., 10 days)
  - Develop a long-term momentum factor
    - Calculate the cumulative return over a long-term window (e.g., 100 days)
  - Combine short- and long-term momentum
    - Use a weighted sum of short- and long-term momentum factors, with weights adjusted based on recent market conditions
- Use adaptive lookback periods
  - Implement a rolling window approach
    - Vary the lookback period based on recent market conditions (e.g., volatility, volume trends)
    - Use a shorter lookback period in volatile markets and a longer lookback period in stable markets
- Incorporate market sentiment
  - Derive a market sentiment score
    - Use the ratio of positive to negative volume days over a lookback period
    - Incorporate the change in open interest (if available) as a proxy for market sentiment
  - Adjust alpha factors based on market sentiment
    - Increase the weight of momentum factors when market sentiment is positive
    - Decrease the weight of momentum factors when market sentiment is negative
- Simplify to avoid overfitting
  - Use a minimal set of interpretable factors
  - Avoid complex interactions and transformations
- Leverage machine learning for dynamic weighting
  - Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., linear regression) to dynamically adjust the weights of the factors
  - Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well
  - Update the model periodically using new data to adapt to changing market conditions
