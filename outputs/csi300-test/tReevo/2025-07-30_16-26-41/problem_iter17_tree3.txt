- Calculate Volume-Weighted Moving Averages (VWMA)
  - Compute VWMA for close prices over short-term (e.g., 5 days) and long-term (e.g., 20 days)
  - Subtract short-term VWMA from long-term VWMA to get a momentum factor
- Calculate Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
  - Compute EMA for close prices over short-term (e.g., 5 days) and long-term (e.g., 20 days)
  - Subtract short-term EMA from long-term EMA to get another momentum factor
- Calculate Volume-Weighted Price Change (VWPC)
  - Compute the difference between today's close price and the previous day's close price
  - Multiply this difference by the volume of the current day
  - Sum the result over a short-term window (e.g., 5 days) to get a liquidity-adjusted momentum factor
- Calculate Volume-Weighted Volatility (VWV)
  - Compute the standard deviation of daily returns over a short-term window (e.g., 10 days)
  - Multiply each return by the corresponding volume
  - Take the square root of the sum of squared, volume-weighted returns to get a volatility factor
- Calculate Exponentially Smoothed Volume-Weighted Momentum (ESVWM)
  - Apply exponential smoothing to the VWPC to smooth out short-term fluctuations
  - Use a smoothing factor (alpha) that adjusts based on recent market conditions
  - This provides a balanced, smoothed momentum factor
- Combine Factors
  - Combine the momentum factors (short-term VWMA, short-term EMA, VWPC, ESVWM) using a simple average or weighted average
  - Combine the volatility factors (VWV) to adjust for risk
  - Generate a final alpha factor by combining the combined momentum and volatility factors
