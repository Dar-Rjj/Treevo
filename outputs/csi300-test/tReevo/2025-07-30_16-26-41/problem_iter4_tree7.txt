Long-Term Weighted Momentum Adjusted for Volatility and Cumulative Averages
├── Calculate Long-Term Weighted Price Difference
│   ├── Sum of (High - Low) * Volume per day over 20 days
│   └── Sum of Volume over 20 days
│       └── Daily High, Low Prices, and Volumes
├── Determine Long-Term Open to Close Momentum
│   ├── (Close of Day t - Open of Day t-20)
│   └── Use Close and Open prices for specific days
├── Calculate the Long-Term Cumulative Weighted Average
│   ├── Divide Long-Term Weighted Price Difference by Total Volume
│   └── Use the result as a momentum factor
├── Subtract Long-Term Average Daily Return
│   ├── Sum of (Close of Day t - Close of Day t-1) over 20 days
│   └── Number of Days in Consideration
│       └── Daily Close Prices
├── Adjust for Volatility
│   ├── Calculate 20-Day Standard Deviation of Daily Returns
│   │   ├── Daily Returns: (Close of Day t - Close of Day t-1) / Close of Day t-1
│   │   └── Use close prices for specific days
│   └── Divide the Final Alpha Factor by the 20-Day Standard Deviation
├── Incorporate Cumulative Intraday Movement
│   ├── Calculate Cumulative Intraday Price Range
│   │   ├── Sum of (High - Low) over 20 days
│   ├── Calculate Cumulative Volume-Weighted Close-Open Difference
│   │   ├── Sum of (Close - Open) * Volume over 20 days
│   └── Divide Cumulative Volume-Weighted Close-Open Difference by Cumulative Intraday Price Range
│       └── Use the result as an additional momentum factor
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Long-Term Cumulative Weighted Average
    ├── Subtract the Long-Term average daily return
    ├── Adjusted for Volatility
    └── Combined with Cumulative Intraday Movement
