Combine short- and long-term momentum with volume-weighted exponential smoothing
|___ Adjust for volatility
|   |___ Calculate 20-day and 60-day historical volatility
|   |___ Use 20-day volatility to adjust short-term momentum
|   |___ Use 60-day volatility to adjust long-term momentum
|___ Incorporate sentiment
|   |___ Define a sentiment score based on (high - low) / (open - close)
|   |___ Apply a 10-day simple moving average to the sentiment score
|___ Use adaptive window sizes
|   |___ Determine the adaptive window size based on recent price trends
|   |___ Calculate short-term momentum using a 5-to-20 day adaptive window
|   |___ Calculate long-term momentum using a 30-to-60 day adaptive window
|___ Prioritize recent, liquidity-adjusted data
|   |___ Weight the data by the most recent 10-day average volume
|   |___ Calculate the volume-weighted exponential moving average (VWEMA) of prices
|   |___ Use the VWEMA to smooth the momentum calculations
|___ Simplify calculations for clarity
|   |___ Use simple arithmetic operations to combine adjusted momentum and sentiment
|   |___ Final factor: (Short-term momentum + Long-term momentum) * Sentiment score
