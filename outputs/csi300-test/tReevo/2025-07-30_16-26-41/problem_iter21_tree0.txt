- Short-term Momentum and Adaptive Volatility
  - Calculate EMA for Close Price
    - Use 5-day EMA to capture short-term trend
    - Use 20-day EMA to capture medium-term trend
  - Calculate Volatility
    - Use 10-day standard deviation of daily returns
    - Use 30-day standard deviation of daily returns
  - Dynamic Weights
    - Calculate the ratio of 5-day EMA to 20-day EMA
    - Use this ratio as a weight to adjust the impact of short-term momentum
  - Integrate Volume Trends
    - Calculate 5-day EMA of Volume
    - Calculate 20-day EMA of Volume
    - Use the ratio of 5-day EMA of Volume to 20-day EMA of Volume to adjust the impact of volume trends
  - Sector Performance
    - Calculate the average 5-day and 20-day EMA of Close Prices for the sector
    - Use the ratio of the stock's 5-day EMA to the sector's 5-day EMA
    - Use the ratio of the stock's 20-day EMA to the sector's 20-day EMA
    - Combine these ratios to adjust the impact of sector performance
  - Balance Factors
    - Combine the adjusted short-term momentum, adaptive volatility, and dynamic weights
    - Adjust the factor to avoid overfitting by using a simple linear combination
- Liquidity Adjustment
  - Calculate the average 20-day Volume
  - Use the ratio of the current day's Volume to the 20-day average Volume
  - Adjust the final alpha factor by this liquidity ratio
- Final Alpha Factor
  - Combine the balanced factors and the liquidity adjustment
  - Output the final interpretable alpha factor
