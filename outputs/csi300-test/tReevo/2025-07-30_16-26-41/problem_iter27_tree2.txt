- Integrate Liquidity, Dynamic Volatility, and Volume Adjustments
  - Define liquidity measures
    - Average daily trading volume over a certain period (e.g., 30 days)
    - Trading range: high price - low price
  - Define dynamic volatility measures
    - Historical volatility (standard deviation of returns) over different lookback periods
    - Intraday volatility: (high - low) / average price
  - Combine liquidity and volatility
    - Weighted sum of liquidity and volatility, with weights adjusted by recent market conditions
  - Volume adjustments
    - Volume-weighted return: (return * volume) / total volume
    - Relative volume: current day volume / average volume over a certain period
- Balance Short- and Long-Term Momentum
  - Calculate short-term momentum
    - Simple moving average (SMA) of close prices over a short period (e.g., 10 days)
    - Rate of change (ROC) of close price over the same short period
  - Calculate long-term momentum
    - Simple moving average (SMA) of close prices over a longer period (e.g., 200 days)
    - Rate of change (ROC) of close price over the same longer period
  - Combine short- and long-term momentum
    - Difference between short-term and long-term SMA
    - Ratio of short-term to long-term ROC
- Use Adaptive Lookback Periods
  - Define an adaptive lookback period
    - Based on market volatility or trading activity (e.g., increase lookback when volatility is high)
  - Recalculate momentum and volatility using the adaptive lookback
    - Update short- and long-term momentum with new lookback periods
    - Update historical volatility with new lookback periods
- Incorporate Market Sentiment
  - Measure market sentiment
    - Cumulative difference between open and close prices over a period (indicating buying or selling pressure)
    - Proportion of up days to down days in a period
  - Combine market sentiment with other factors
    - Adjust the weights of liquidity, volatility, and momentum based on sentiment
- Simplify to Avoid Overfitting
  - Reduce the number of parameters
    - Use a single combined measure instead of multiple individual measures
  - Use fewer and more robust indicators
    - Focus on widely used and proven technical indicators
- Leverage Machine Learning for Dynamic Weighting
  - Train a machine learning model
    - Input: historical data of all calculated factors
    - Output: future stock returns
  - Use the model to dynamically adjust the weights of the factors
    - Rebalance the factor weights periodically (e.g., monthly) based on the model's predictions
