Leverage Market Dynamics and Sentiment for Predictive Alpha Factor Generation
|-- Incorporate Liquidity Analysis
|   |-- Calculate Average True Range (ATR) as a Measure of Volatility
|   |   |-- Use close, high, low prices to compute ATR
|   |-- Analyze Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for Execution Quality
|       |-- Integrate VWAP with volume data; utilize closing price for recent momentum
|-- Assess Momentum and Trend Following
|   |-- Implement Short-Term Moving Average Crossover System
|   |   |-- Consider 10-day and 20-day moving averages
|   |-- Apply Long-Term Moving Average Crossover System
|   |   |-- Use 50-day and 200-day moving averages
|   |-- Develop Adaptive Lookback Periods Based on Market Conditions
|       |-- Dynamically adjust lookback periods using ATR or market sentiment shifts
|-- Integrate Volume Adjustments into Momentum Signals
|   |-- Enhance Momentum Signals with Volume Spikes
|       |-- Identify days with significantly higher volume than average; weight them more in the momentum calculation
|-- Incorporate Market Sentiment Indicators
    |-- Use High-Low Price Ratio as a Simple Sentiment Indicator
    |   |-- Calculate the ratio of the number of days where the high was achieved after the close over a fixed period
    |-- Experiment with Open-Close Price Spread Analysis
        |-- Analyze the difference between open and close prices; positive spread indicates bullish, negative is bearish
