- Short-Term Momentum and Volatility Alpha Factor
  - Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices
    - Use EMA with a short period (e.g., 5 days)
      - Store the EMA values for each day
  - Calculate Standard Deviation of Close Prices
    - Use a rolling window (e.g., 10 days)
      - Store the standard deviation values for each day
  - Combine EMA and Standard Deviation
    - Compute the ratio of EMA to Standard Deviation
      - This factor adjusts for recent price momentum and volatility
- Volume Trend Alpha Factor
  - Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Volume
    - Use EMA with a short period (e.g., 5 days)
      - Store the EMA values for each day
  - Calculate the difference between current volume and EMA of Volume
    - This captures the trend in volume
      - Positive values indicate increasing volume, negative values indicate decreasing volume
- Sector Performance Alpha Factor
  - Calculate the average close price of the sector
    - Use the close prices of all stocks within the same sector
    - Store the average close price for each day
  - Calculate the difference between the stock's close price and the sector's average close price
    - This captures the relative performance of the stock within its sector
- Dynamic Weighting and Integration
  - Assign weights to each of the three factors
    - Weights can be based on historical performance or heuristic rules
    - Sum the weighted factors to get the final alpha factor
  - Adjust for Liquidity
    - Multiply the final alpha factor by the ratio of the stock's volume to the median volume over a period
      - This adjusts the factor for the liquidity of the stock
- Final Alpha Factor Calculation
  - Combine the weighted factors and adjust for liquidity
    - Final alpha factor = (w1 * Momentum_Volatility_Factor + w2 * Volume_Trend_Factor + w3 * Sector_Performance_Factor) * Liquidity_Adjustment
      - Ensure that the sum of weights (w1 + w2 + w3) equals 1
