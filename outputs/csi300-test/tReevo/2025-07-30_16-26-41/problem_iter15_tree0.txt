Combine short- and long-term momentum with volume-weighted exponential smoothing
|-- Adjust for volatility
|   |-- Calculate short-term volatility using standard deviation of returns over a 10-day window
|   `-- Calculate long-term volatility using standard deviation of returns over a 50-day window
|-- Incorporate sentiment
|   |-- Calculate daily sentiment score from external data (e.g., news, social media)
|   `-- Apply sentiment score as a multiplier to the combined momentum factor
|-- Use adaptive window sizes
|   |-- Determine the optimal short-term window size based on recent market conditions
|   |   |-- If recent market is trending, use a 10-day window
|   |   `-- If recent market is ranging, use a 5-day window
|   `-- Determine the optimal long-term window size based on recent market conditions
|       |-- If recent market is trending, use a 50-day window
|       `-- If recent market is ranging, use a 20-day window
|-- Prioritize recent, liquidity-adjusted data
|   |-- Apply volume-weighted exponential smoothing to the close price
|   |   |-- Use a higher smoothing factor for more recent data
|   |   `-- Use volume as the weight in the exponential smoothing
|   `-- Calculate short-term momentum using the smoothed close price over the short-term window
|   `-- Calculate long-term momentum using the smoothed close price over the long-term window
`-- Simplify calculations for clarity
    |-- Combine short-term and long-term momentum factors
    |   |-- Short-term momentum: (Smoothed Close Price - Open Price) / Open Price
    |   `-- Long-term momentum: (Smoothed Close Price - Low Price) / Low Price
    `-- Final alpha factor: (Short-term Momentum + Long-term Momentum) * Sentiment Score
