- Construct a dynamic, volume-weighted momentum factor
  - Calculate the raw return over a short-term period (e.g., 5 days)
    - Use (close_t / close_t-5) - 1 to compute the 5-day return
  - Weight the returns by trading volume
    - Multiply the 5-day return by the average volume over the same 5 days
  - Sum the volume-weighted returns for a longer period (e.g., 20 days)
    - Aggregate the volume-weighted returns over the past 20 days
- Incorporate an adaptive volatility adjustment
  - Calculate the rolling standard deviation of returns over a short-term period (e.g., 20 days)
    - Use the standard deviation of daily returns over the past 20 days
  - Adjust the volume-weighted momentum by the inverse of the rolling standard deviation
    - Divide the 20-day aggregated volume-weighted return by the 20-day rolling standard deviation
- Apply sector-specific EMA
  - Calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the adjusted volume-weighted momentum for each sector
    - Use a short-term EMA (e.g., 5 days) to capture recent trends
    - Use a long-term EMA (e.g., 20 days) to smooth out noise
  - Compute the difference between the short-term and long-term EMAs
    - Subtract the 20-day EMA from the 5-day EMA
- Include liquidity adjustments
  - Calculate the liquidity ratio as the average trading amount divided by the average trading volume
    - Use the average amount and volume over the past 20 days
  - Adjust the sector-specific EMA difference by the liquidity ratio
    - Multiply the EMA difference by the liquidity ratio
- Combine the factors with fixed weights
  - Assign a fixed weight to the adaptive volatility-adjusted volume-weighted momentum
  - Assign a fixed weight to the liquidity-adjusted EMA difference
  - Sum the weighted factors to generate the final alpha factor
