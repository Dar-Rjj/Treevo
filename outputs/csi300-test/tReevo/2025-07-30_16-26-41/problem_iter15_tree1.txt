- Combine short- and long-term momentum with volume-weighted exponential smoothing
  - Calculate short-term momentum
    - Use close prices to compute the percentage change over a short window (e.g., 5 days)
    - Apply volume-weighted exponential smoothing to the short-term momentum
      - Use the formula: VWES_short = (alpha * (close_t - close_(t-1)) + (1 - alpha) * VWES_short_(t-1)) * volume_t / sum(volume)
      - Set alpha to 0.9 for short-term focus
  - Calculate long-term momentum
    - Use close prices to compute the percentage change over a long window (e.g., 20 days)
    - Apply volume-weighted exponential smoothing to the long-term momentum
      - Use the formula: VWES_long = (beta * (close_t - close_(t-20)) + (1 - beta) * VWES_long_(t-1)) * volume_t / sum(volume)
      - Set beta to 0.1 for long-term focus
  - Combine short- and long-term momentum
    - Compute a weighted average of the two momentum signals
      - Combined_momentum = weight_short * VWES_short + weight_long * VWES_long
      - Set initial weights to 0.6 for short-term and 0.4 for long-term
- Adjust for volatility
  - Calculate daily returns
    - Daily_returns = (close_t - close_(t-1)) / close_(t-1)
  - Compute rolling standard deviation of daily returns over a window (e.g., 20 days)
  - Adjust combined momentum by dividing it by the rolling standard deviation
    - Momentum_adjusted = Combined_momentum / rolling_std
- Incorporate sentiment
  - Use a simple sentiment score derived from high and low prices
    - Sentiment_score = (high_t - low_t) / (high_t + low_t)
  - Adjust the momentum-adjusted signal by the sentiment score
    - Final_signal = Momentum_adjusted * Sentiment_score
- Use adaptive window sizes
  - Adjust the window size based on recent volatility
    - If rolling_std > threshold, use shorter windows (e.g., 3 days and 10 days)
    - If rolling_std <= threshold, use longer windows (e.g., 5 days and 20 days)
  - Recalculate the final signal with the adaptive windows
    - Repeat the steps to calculate the final signal with the new window sizes
- Prioritize recent, liquidity-adjusted data
  - Use a weighted average of recent and older data, with higher weights on recent data
    - Weighted_final_signal = (gamma * recent_final_signal + (1 - gamma) * older_final_signal)
    - Set gamma to 0.7 to emphasize recent data
- Simplify calculations for clarity
  - Ensure all steps are clearly defined and follow a logical order
  - Avoid unnecessary complexity in the calculations
