- Combine sentiment, sector performance, and news impact
  - Sentiment Analysis
    - Calculate daily sentiment score from news articles
      - Use NLP to extract sentiment from headlines and articles
      - Assign a sentiment score (positive, neutral, negative)
    - Impact of sentiment on stock returns
      - Calculate the correlation between sentiment score and next day's return
      - Create a sentiment-based alpha factor
  - Sector Performance
    - Calculate daily sector performance
      - Group stocks by sector and calculate sector return
      - Determine the relative performance of each sector
    - Impact of sector performance on individual stock returns
      - Calculate the correlation between sector performance and next day's stock return
      - Create a sector-based alpha factor
  - News Impact
    - Calculate the impact of major news events
      - Identify significant news events affecting the market
      - Quantify the impact of these events on stock prices
    - Create a news impact alpha factor
      - Calculate the correlation between news impact and next day's return
      - Generate an alpha factor based on news impact
- Adaptive EMA Windows
  - Calculate adaptive EMA for different time periods
    - Use a shorter EMA window for recent data
    - Use a longer EMA window for historical data
  - Dynamic adjustment of EMA windows
    - Adjust the EMA window size based on market volatility
    - Use a measure of market volatility to determine the optimal EMA window
- Volume-Weighted Metrics
  - Calculate volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
    - Compute the VWAP using the volume and price data
    - Compare VWAP with the closing price to generate a signal
  - Volume-weighted return
    - Calculate the return weighted by trading volume
    - Use this as an indicator of market sentiment and strength
- Dynamic Factor Weighting
  - Assign weights to different factors dynamically
    - Use a machine learning model to determine the importance of each factor
    - Update the weights based on the performance of each factor
  - Combine multiple factors into a single composite alpha factor
    - Sum the weighted factors to create a final alpha factor
- Balance Short and Long-Term Factors
  - Short-term alpha factors
    - Use factors that are sensitive to recent market movements
    - Examples: short-term EMA, intraday volatility, and high-frequency trading signals
  - Long-term alpha factors
    - Use factors that capture long-term trends
    - Examples: long-term EMA, 50-day moving average, and yearly performance
- Exponential Smoothing
  - Apply exponential smoothing to the alpha factors
    - Use a smoothing factor to reduce noise in the alpha factor
    - Ensure the alpha factor is robust and interpretable
- Composite Alpha Factor
  - Combine all the generated alpha factors
    - Use a weighted sum to combine the different factors
    - Optimize the weights to maximize predictive power
  - Evaluate the composite alpha factor
    - Test the factor on historical data
    - Measure its predictive power and robustness
