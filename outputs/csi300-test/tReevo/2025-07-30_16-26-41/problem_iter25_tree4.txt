- Generate adaptive volatility factor
  - Calculate daily returns
  - Compute rolling standard deviation of daily returns
  - Weight recent volatility more heavily
    - Use exponential moving average for volatility
- Create dynamic weight-adjusted momentum
  - Compute short-term (e.g., 10-day) and long-term (e.g., 50-day) momentum
  - Adjust weights using machine learning model
    - Train a model to predict future returns based on past return patterns
    - Use the model's predictions to adjust the weights of short-term and long-term momentum
- Incorporate liquidity into the factor
  - Calculate volume-weighted price
    - Use (high + low + close) / 3 * volume
  - Compute rolling average of volume-weighted prices
  - Use this as a liquidity indicator
- Develop multi-period momentum
  - Calculate momentum over multiple periods (e.g., 10-day, 20-day, 50-day)
  - Combine these momentum indicators
    - Use weighted average with dynamic weights
- Integrate sector rotation
  - Identify the sector of each stock
  - Calculate sector performance
  - Adjust the factor based on the relative performance of the sector
- Incorporate macroeconomic indicators
  - Use external data like GDP growth, inflation rates, etc.
  - Adjust the factor based on the macroeconomic conditions
  - Example: If GDP growth is high, give more weight to momentum factors
- Combine all factors
  - Aggregate the adaptive volatility, dynamic weight-adjusted momentum, liquidity, multi-period momentum, sector rotation, and macroeconomic indicators
  - Use a final weighting scheme to combine these factors
    - Ensure the combination is interpretable and not overly complex
- Evaluate and refine the factor
  - Backtest the factor on historical data
  - Refine the parameters and weighting schemes based on backtest results
  - Ensure the factor remains robust and interpretable
