Incorporate market depth, leverage dynamic window sizing, and integrate macroeconomic indicators for enhanced predictive power
|-- Incorporate Market Depth
|   |-- Calculate Bid-Ask Spread
|   |   |-- Use (high - low) as a proxy for bid-ask spread
|   `-- Adjust Momentum by Market Depth
|       |-- Scale momentum factor by inverse of bid-ask spread
|-- Leverage Dynamic Window Sizing
|   |-- Short-Term Window
|   |   |-- Calculate short-term momentum
|   |   `-- Apply volume-weighted exponential smoothing
|   `-- Long-Term Window
|       |-- Calculate long-term momentum
|       `-- Apply volume-weighted exponential smoothing
|   `-- Adaptive Window Sizing
|       |-- Determine window size based on historical volatility
|       |   |-- High volatility -> shorter window
|       |   `-- Low volatility -> longer window
|       `-- Update window sizes dynamically
`-- Integrate Macroeconomic Indicators
    |-- Identify Relevant Macroeconomic Indicators
    |   |-- Example: GDP growth rate, interest rates, inflation
    `-- Incorporate Macroeconomic Sentiment
        |-- Define a macroeconomic sentiment score
        |   |-- Positive if GDP growth rate is above a threshold
        |   `-- Negative if GDP growth rate is below a threshold
        `-- Weight momentum by the macroeconomic sentiment score
