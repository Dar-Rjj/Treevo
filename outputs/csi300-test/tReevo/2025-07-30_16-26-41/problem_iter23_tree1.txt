- Construct a dynamic, volume-weighted momentum factor
  - Calculate the raw return over a short-term window (e.g., 10 days)
  - Weight the returns by the trading volume of each day
  - Sum the volume-weighted returns to get the volume-weighted momentum
- Incorporate adaptive volatility
  - Calculate the standard deviation of returns over the same short-term window
  - Adjust the volume-weighted momentum by dividing it by the standard deviation
- Apply sector-specific EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
  - Identify the sector of the stock
  - Calculate a short-term EMA (e.g., 10 days) for the sector
  - Adjust the adaptive momentum factor by subtracting the sector EMA
- Introduce liquidity adjustments
  - Calculate the average daily trading volume over the short-term window
  - Adjust the final factor by multiplying it by the average daily trading volume
  - This ensures that the factor is more responsive in liquid stocks
- Simplify with fixed weights
  - Use a fixed weight for the short-term window (e.g., 10 days)
  - Avoid using multiple time frames or complex weighting schemes
- Focus on short-term responsiveness
  - Ensure the factor is designed to capture short-term trends and momentum
  - Avoid incorporating long-term signals or indicators
- Avoid overfitting
  - Use a simple, interpretable formula
  - Avoid adding unnecessary complexity or parameters
