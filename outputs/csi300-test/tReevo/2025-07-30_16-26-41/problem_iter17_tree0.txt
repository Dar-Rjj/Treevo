- Novel Alpha Factor: Exponential Moving Average Crossover with Volume-Weighted Momentum
  - Calculate the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) for both short and long-term windows
    - Short-term EMA (e.g., 10 days)
      - Use the close price to calculate the EMA
    - Long-term EMA (e.g., 50 days)
      - Use the close price to calculate the EMA
  - Calculate the Volume-Weighted Momentum
    - Compute the difference between the current close price and the close price n days ago
      - e.g., n = 20
    - Weight this difference by the average volume over the same period
      - e.g., sum of volume over the last 20 days
  - Combine the EMAs and Volume-Weighted Momentum
    - Subtract the long-term EMA from the short-term EMA
    - Multiply the result by the Volume-Weighted Momentum
  - Adjust for Liquidity
    - Multiply the combined factor by the average volume over the last 20 days
  - Simplify the calculations
    - Ensure the factor is robust and easily interpretable
  - Balance Long and Short-Term Factors
    - Use a dynamic window for the EMAs based on recent market volatility
      - e.g., if volatility is high, use shorter windows
      - if volatility is low, use longer windows
  - Focus on Clear, Robust Metrics
    - Ensure the factor is not overly sensitive to small changes in input data
