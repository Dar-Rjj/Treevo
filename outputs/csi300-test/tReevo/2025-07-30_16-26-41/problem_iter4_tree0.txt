Enhanced Long-Term Weighted Momentum with Advanced Volatility Measures
├── Calculate Long-Term Weighted Price Difference
│   ├── Sum of (High - Low) * Volume per day over 20 days
│   └── Sum of Volume over 20 days
│       └── Daily High and Low Prices
├── Determine Long-Term Open to Close Momentum
│   ├── (Close of Day t - Open of Day t-20)
│   └── Use Close and Open prices for specific days
├── Calculate the Long-Term Cumulative Weighted Average
│   ├── Divide Long-Term Weighted Price Difference by Total Volume
│   └── Use the result as a momentum factor
├── Subtract Long-Term Average Daily Return
│   ├── Sum of (Close of Day t - Close of Day t-1) over 20 days
│   └── Number of Days in Consideration
├── Adjust for Advanced Volatility
│   ├── Calculate 20-Day Standard Deviation of Daily Returns
│   │   ├── Daily Returns: (Close of Day t - Close of Day t-1) / Close of Day t-1
│   │   └── Use close prices for specific days
│   ├── Calculate 20-Day Average True Range (ATR)
│   │   ├── True Range: Max(High - Low, Abs(High - Previous Close), Abs(Low - Previous Close))
│   │   └── Sum of True Range over 20 days
│   ├── Combine Standard Deviation and ATR
│   │   ├── Sum of 20-Day Standard Deviation and 20-Day ATR
│   │   └── Divide by 2 to get the average
│   └── Divide the Final Alpha Factor by the Combined Volatility Measure
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Long-Term Cumulative Weighted Average
    ├── Subtract the Long-Term average daily return
    └── Adjusted for Combined Volatility Measure
