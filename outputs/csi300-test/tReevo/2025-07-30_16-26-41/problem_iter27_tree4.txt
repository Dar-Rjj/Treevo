- Develop novel and interpretable alpha factors
  - Incorporate liquidity measures
    - Calculate average daily volume over a short-term window (e.g., 5 days)
    - Calculate average daily volume over a long-term window (e.g., 20 days)
    - Compute the ratio of short-term to long-term volume
  - Integrate dynamic volatility
    - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a short-term window (e.g., 10 days)
    - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a long-term window (e.g., 60 days)
    - Compute the ratio of short-term to long-term volatility
  - Balance short- and long-term momentum
    - Calculate short-term price momentum (e.g., 5-day price change)
    - Calculate medium-term price momentum (e.g., 20-day price change)
    - Calculate long-term price momentum (e.g., 100-day price change)
    - Combine short-, medium-, and long-term momentums using a weighted sum
  - Use adaptive lookback periods
    - Define an adaptive lookback period based on the recent market conditions (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 days based on the last 60-day volatility)
    - Adjust the lookback period for momentum and volatility calculations
  - Incorporate market sentiment
    - Calculate the ratio of close-to-open price changes over a short-term window (e.g., 5 days)
    - Calculate the ratio of close-to-open price changes over a long-term window (e.g., 20 days)
    - Compute the ratio of short-term to long-term close-to-open price changes
  - Simplify to avoid overfitting
    - Select a subset of the most significant factors
    - Use linear combinations of selected factors
  - Leverage machine learning for dynamic weighting
    - Train a model to dynamically weight the selected factors
    - Use the model's predictions as the final alpha factor
