- Root: Generate a novel and interpretable alpha factor using dynamic, volume-weighted momentum with adaptive volatility, sector-specific EMA, and liquidity adjustments.
  - Dynamic, Volume-Weighted Momentum
    - Calculate the momentum over a short-term period (e.g., 10 days)
      - Use the closing price of the last day as the reference price
      - Sum the product of daily returns and volume for the last 10 days
      - Momentum = Σ[(close_t - open_t) / open_t * volume_t] for t in [t-9, t]
  - Adaptive Volatility
    - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a short-term period (e.g., 20 days)
      - Daily return = (close_t - open_t) / open_t
      - Volatility = stdev(daily_returns) for t in [t-19, t]
    - Adjust the momentum by the adaptive volatility
      - Adjusted Momentum = Momentum / Volatility
  - Sector-Specific Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    - Calculate the EMA of the closing prices for each sector
      - Use a shorter span for sectors with higher historical volatility
      - EMA_sector = EMA(close, span=span_sector) where span_sector is specific to the sector
    - Normalize the adjusted momentum by the sector EMA
      - Normalized Momentum = Adjusted Momentum / EMA_sector
  - Liquidity Adjustment
    - Calculate the average daily trading volume over a short-term period (e.g., 30 days)
      - Avg_Volume = mean(volume_t) for t in [t-29, t]
    - Adjust the normalized momentum by the liquidity
      - Liquidity Adjusted Momentum = Normalized Momentum * Avg_Volume
  - Final Alpha Factor
    - Combine the liquidity-adjusted momentum with a fixed weight
      - Alpha Factor = Liquidity Adjusted Momentum * 1.0
