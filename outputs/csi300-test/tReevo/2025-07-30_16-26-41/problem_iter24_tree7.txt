Thought: Consider trend, momentum, and volume indicators; integrate multi-day patterns for more robust factors.
  Thought: Trend Indicators
    Thought: Moving Average Crossover
      Sub-thought: Calculate 5-day and 20-day moving averages of close prices.
      Sub-thought: Subtract the 20-day MA from the 5-day MA to get a trend signal.
    Thought: Price Change Over Period
      Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in close price over a 20-day period.
      Sub-thought: Use this as a simple trend indicator.
  Thought: Momentum Indicators
    Thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
      Sub-thought: Calculate the average gain and average loss over the last 14 days.
      Sub-thought: Compute RSI using the formula: 100 - (100 / (1 + (average gain / average loss))).
    Thought: Rate of Change (ROC)
      Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in close price from today to the same day n periods ago.
      Sub-thought: Use different n values (e.g., 10, 20) to capture different momentum periods.
  Thought: Volume Indicators
    Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
      Sub-thought: Initialize OBV at 0.
      Sub-thought: For each day, if the close price is higher than the previous close, add the volume to OBV.
      Sub-thought: If the close price is lower than the previous close, subtract the volume from OBV.
      Sub-thought: If the close price is equal to the previous close, do not change OBV.
    Thought: Volume Change
      Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume from the previous day.
      Sub-thought: This can indicate increasing or decreasing interest in the stock.
  Thought: Multi-Day Patterns
    Thought: Price Pattern - Bullish Engulfing
      Sub-thought: Identify a pattern where the open price on day t is below the close price on day t-1, and the close price on day t is above the open price on day t-1.
    Thought: Price Pattern - Bearish Engulfing
      Sub-thought: Identify a pattern where the open price on day t is above the close price on day t-1, and the close price on day t is below the open price on day t-1.
    Thought: Volume Spike with Price Movement
      Sub-thought: Identify days where the volume is significantly higher than the average volume over the past 20 days.
      Sub-thought: Check if the close price on such days is higher or lower than the previous close to determine the direction of the spike.
