Simplify calculations, prioritize volume and price momentum, and apply EMA for smoothing.
Integrate more price dynamics, refine volume weighting, and consider longer smoothing periods.
Consider longer smoothing periods and more accurate intraday momentum for better predictive power.
Simplify calculations, integrate momentum and VWAP directly, and apply EMA for smoothing.
Incorporate longer-term trends, refine volume weighting, and consider multi-day momentum for enhanced predictive power.
Increase smoothing period, adjust intraday momentum, and consider additional price/volume features for better alpha.
Incorporate sentiment, refine VWAP, and use EMA for smoothing to improve alpha factor effectiveness.
Adjust weights, incorporate more prices, and extend smoothing period for enhanced factor stability and predictive power.
Integrate more pricing data, adjust volume weighting, and extend smoothing period for enhanced factor robustness.
