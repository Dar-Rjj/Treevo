Integrate more price dynamics, optimize VWAP, and extend EMA period for smoother factor.
Increase smoothing period, adjust weightings, and consider additional momentum indicators for enhanced predictive power.
Simplify calculations, focus on key price differences, and extend smoothing for more robust factors.
Simplify calculations, focus on key price movements, and use dynamic volume weighting for more responsive factors.
Simplify calculations, focus on key price movements, and use longer EMA for smoothing.
Incorporate volume-weighted prices, refine momentum calculations, and adjust EMA periods for smoother, more reactive factors.
Incorporate relative strength, use adaptive EMA, and include trade direction for enhanced momentum.
Refine momentum measures, optimize VWAP calculation, and focus on smoothing techniques for stability.
Incorporate more price types in VWAP, adjust momentum with open-to-close returns, and refine smoothing period.
Simplify calculations, use single VWAP, and focus on key momentum indicators for better performance.
