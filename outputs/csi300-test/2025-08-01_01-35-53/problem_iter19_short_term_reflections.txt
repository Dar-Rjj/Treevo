Incorporate dynamic weighting, focus on shorter-term momentum, and blend with long-term trends for stability.
Reduce smoothing period, emphasize VWAP, and dynamically adjust based on volume changes.
Focus on short-term EMA, and consider the impact of volume on intraday momentum.
Use close-to-open return, refined VWAP, and a shorter EMA for more responsive and accurate alpha signals.
Integrate volatility, use adaptive EMAs, and consider liquidity for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate long-term trends, refine momentum calculations, and use more comprehensive price data for VWAP.
Incorporate more dynamic price changes, refine VWAP calculation, and adjust EMA period for responsiveness.
Focus on VWAP, intraday spread, and recent volume. Shorten EMA period for responsiveness.
Focus on dynamic volume weighting, recent price changes, and shorter EMA for quicker response.
Integrate more price levels for VWAP, refine momentum with closer timeframes, and adjust EMA for optimal responsiveness.
