Focus on more dynamic intraday indicators and adjust the smoothing period for faster response.
Simplify calculations, focus on key price movements, and use shorter EMA for more responsive signals.
Focus on precise momentum and VWAP calculations, then effectively smooth and weight by volume for enhanced predictive power.
Simplify VWAP calculation, maintain focus on recent momentum, and adjust EMA period for optimal performance.
Focus on long-term momentum, incorporate previous day's return, and smooth with a longer EMA for better performance.
Focus on shorter-term trends, fewer combined factors, and smoother EMA for clearer signals.
Incorporate diverse momentum indicators and longer-term trends, then smooth for stability.
Focus on direct volume integration, use close-to-open returns, and apply short-term EMA for responsiveness.
Focus on precise intraday momentum, use VWAP with all prices, and smooth with a longer EMA.
Focus on accurate momentum, refined VWAP, and effective smoothing. Simplify volume trend integration.
