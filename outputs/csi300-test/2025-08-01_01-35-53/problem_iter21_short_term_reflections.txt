Focus on dynamic momentum, precise VWAP, and effective smoothing for more responsive and accurate alpha factors.
Incorporate more dynamic price levels, use adaptive smoothing, and integrate relative strength measures.
Incorporate recent price changes, use comprehensive VWAP, and apply shorter EMA for quicker responsiveness.
Use Close-to-Open return, simplify VWAP calculation, and apply a shorter EMA for quicker response.
Simplify calculations, use close-to-open return, and apply shorter EMA for quicker response.
Integrate more price dynamics, long-term trends, and volatility measures for a robust alpha factor.
Focus on recent data, simplify calculations, and consistently apply EMA for smoother factor values.
Focus on volatility-adjusted EMAs, refine intraday momentum, and simplify VWAP integration for enhanced factor stability and responsiveness.
