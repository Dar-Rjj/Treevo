Simplify calculations, integrate momentum directly with VWAP, and maintain volume weighting before smoothing.
Simplify calculations, focus on key momentum indicators, and use shorter EMA periods for more responsive factors.
Incorporate longer-term price trends and additional momentum indicators for improved predictive power.
Simplify calculations, directly integrate key metrics, and optimize smoothing for enhanced signal clarity.
Integrate more volume dynamics, refine momentum calculations, and optimize EMA periods.
Incorporate volume-weighted momentum, use more recent data, and smooth with a longer EMA for stability.
Incorporate recent price dynamics, use longer smoothing periods, and weight by intraday volume for enhanced signal.
Incorporate longer-term momentum, use adjusted price dynamics, and smooth with a broader EMA for stability.
Incorporate longer-term price trends, use relative strength, and refine volume weighting for enhanced predictive power.
Consider longer smoothing periods and more accurate price inputs for VWAP and momentum calculations.
