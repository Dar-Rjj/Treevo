Multi-Frame Volatility and Volume Momentum
├── Calculate Daily Price Range
│   ├── Use High Price
│   ├── Use Low Price
│   └── Subtract to Find Daily Range
├── Average of Recent Daily Price Ranges
│   ├── Select Last N Days (e.g., 10 days)
│   ├── Sum of Selected Ranges
│   └── Divide by Number of Days
├── Calculate Short-Term Implied Volatility
│   ├── Use Daily Price Range for Last M Days (e.g., 5 days)
│   ├── Sum of Selected Ranges
│   └── Divide by Number of Days
└── Integrate Volume
    ├── Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for Last P Days (e.g., 10 days)
    │   ├── Sum of (Close Price * Volume) for Each Day
    │   └── Divide by Sum of Volumes for the Same Period
    └── Calculate Volume Momentum
        ├── Calculate Difference Between VWAP and Current Close Price
        └── Normalize by Current Close Price
