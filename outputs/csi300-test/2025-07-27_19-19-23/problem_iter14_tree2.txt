Enhanced High-Low and Price Momentum with Volume-Adjusted Movements and VROC
├── Calculate Daily Log Return
│   └── Compute log of current close / previous day close
├── Identify Volume Spikes
│   ├── Calculate Z-Score of Volume
│   │   └── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation
│   └── Classify as Spike if Z-Score exceeds a threshold
├── Adjust Momentum for Volume Spikes
│   ├── If Spike, multiply daily log return by weight
│   └── If not, use original daily log return
├── Smooth the Adjusted Returns
│   └── Use Exponential Moving Average
├── Calculate High-Low Difference
│   └── Subtract Low from High
├── Combine High-Low Difference and Volume Spikes
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Difference by Spike Indicator
│   └── Sum over a fixed lookback period (e.g., 10 days)
├── Calculate Daily Price Movement
│   └── Use Close price
│       ├── Calculate the difference (Close - Open)
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Price Movement
│   └── Multiply Daily Price Movement by Volume
├── Calculate Rolling Momentum Indicator
│   ├── Aggregate Volume Adjusted Price Movements
│   │   ├── Over a 30-day rolling window
│   ├── Calculate the Rolling Average of Aggregated Values
│   │   ├── Use Exponential Weighting for Smoothing
│   └── Derive Momentum from the Rolling Average
│       ├── Subtract the 10-day exponentially weighted moving average 
│           from the 5-day exponentially weighted moving average
├── Cumulative Momentum Factor
    ├── Sum Up Adjusted and Smoothed Returns
    │   ├── Use the summed High-Low Difference and Volume Spikes
    │   └── Use the smoothed adjusted returns
    ├── Combine with Volume Trend
    │   ├── Compute VROC for period m
    │   └── Multiply combined momentum factor by VROC
    └── Add 1 to each daily return before multiplication
