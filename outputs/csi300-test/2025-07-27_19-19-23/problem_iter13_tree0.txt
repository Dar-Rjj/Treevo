Synthesized High-Low and Price Momentum Adjusted by Volume Spikes
├── Calculate Daily Log Return
│   └── Compute log of current close / previous day close
├── Identify Volume Spikes
│   ├── Calculate Z-Score of Volume
│   │   └── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation
│   └── Classify as Spike if Z-Score exceeds a threshold
├── Adjust Momentum for Volume Spikes
│   ├── If Spike, multiply daily log return by weight
│   └── If not, use original daily log return
├── Smooth the Adjusted Returns
│   └── Use Exponential Moving Average
├── Calculate High-Low Difference
│   └── Subtract Low from High
├── Combine High-Low Difference and Volume Spikes
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Difference by Spike Indicator
│   └── Sum over a fixed lookback period (e.g., 10 days)
├── Cumulative Momentum Factor
    ├── Sum Up Adjusted and Smoothed Returns
    │   ├── Use the summed High-Low Difference and Volume Spikes
    │   └── Use the smoothed adjusted returns
    └── Add 1 to each daily return before multiplication
