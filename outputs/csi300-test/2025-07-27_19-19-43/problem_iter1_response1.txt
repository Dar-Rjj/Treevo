```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the close and open price, which gives an idea of the daily price movement.
    daily_movement = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Incorporate the influence of volume by weighing the daily_movement with the log of normalized volume
    # Here, we take the ratio of each day's volume to the 30-day moving average of volume, then apply the log(1+x) transformation.
    # The logic is that abnormally high or low trading volumes can indicate strong market sentiment in a particular direction.
    volume_influence = np.log1p(df['volume'] / df['volume'].rolling(window=30).mean())
    
    # Combine the two factors. The daily_movement reflects the day's price action,
    # while the volume_influence serves as a measure for the intensity of market activity.
    alpha_factor = (daily_movement * volume_influence)
    
    return alpha_factor
