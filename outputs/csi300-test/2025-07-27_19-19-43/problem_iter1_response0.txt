```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between close and open prices, then divide by average volume
    price_diff_to_volume = (df['close'] - df['open']) / (df['volume'].rolling(window=30).mean() + 1e-7)
    # Calculate the ratio of the current day's volume to the 30-day average volume, which reflects relative trading activity
    volume_ratio = df['volume'] / (df['volume'].rolling(window=30).mean() + 1e-7)
    # Combine these two factors in a weighted sum, with more weight on the price difference relative to volume
    alpha_factor = 0.7 * price_diff_to_volume + 0.3 * volume_ratio
    return alpha_factor
