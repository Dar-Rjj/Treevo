Consider adding more market indicators, like RSI or MACD, and optimize weights for each factor.
Incorporate mean reversion, use more dynamic windows, and balance factors with optimized weights.
Incorporate multi-period returns, liquidity measures, and use adaptive weightings for factor combination.
Incorporate adaptive weighting, use logarithmic returns, and consider the correlation between volume and returns for dynamic factor adjustment.
