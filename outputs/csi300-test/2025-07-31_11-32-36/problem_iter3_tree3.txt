Weighted Momentum and Volatility Factor
├── Calculate Daily Returns
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close from Current Day's Close
│       └── Divide by Previous Day's Close
├── Calculate Weighted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 10-Day Moving Average of Daily Returns
│   │   └── Exclude the Most Recent Return for Look-Back Calculation
│   └── Multiply 10-Day Moving Average by Volume
│       └── Adjust for Volume Trend
│           ├── Compute 20-Day Exponential Moving Average of Volume
│           └── Divide 10-Day Moving Average by 20-Day EMA of Volume
└── Calculate Volatility
    ├── Compute 10-Day Standard Deviation of Daily Returns
    │   └── Exclude the Most Recent Return for Look-Back Calculation
    └── Sum Weighted Momentum and Inverse of Volatility
        └── Inverse of Volatility
            ├── Compute 1 over 10-Day Standard Deviation
            └── Ensure No Division by Zero
                └── Add a Small Constant to 10-Day Standard Deviation
