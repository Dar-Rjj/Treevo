  - Sub-thought: Utilize high, low, open, and close prices
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the range (high - low) and its rate of change
      - Sub-thought: Range over 10 days
      - Sub-thought: ROC of range over 10 days
      - Sub-thought: Range over 20 days
      - Sub-thought: ROC of range over 20 days
      - Sub-thought: Range over 50 days
      - Sub-thought: ROC of range over 50 days
    - Sub-thought: Use the relationship between open and close prices
      - Sub-thought: Difference between open and close prices
      - Sub-thought: ROC of the difference between open and close prices over 10 days
      - Sub-thought: ROC of the difference between open and close prices over 20 days

    - Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between price changes and volume
      - Sub-thought: Volume on days with positive price change
      - Sub-thought: Volume on days with negative price change
      - Sub-thought: Ratio of volume on positive price change days to volume on negative price change days
  - Sub-thought: Combine multiple factors
    - Sub-thought: Create a composite score by combining price momentum, volume, and range
      - Sub-thought: Composite score = (ROC of price + ROC of volume + ROC of range) / 3
      - Sub-thought: Test different combinations and weights of the factors
        - Sub-thought: Composite score = 0.5 * (ROC of price) + 0.3 * (ROC of volume) + 0.2 * (ROC of range)
        - Sub-thought: Composite score = 0.6 * (ROC of price) + 0.2 * (ROC of volume) + 0.2 * (ROC of range)
