Thought: Develop novel alpha factors based on price and volume data to predict future stock returns
- Sub-thought: Analyze price patterns
  - Sub-thought: Calculate moving averages
    - Sub-thought: Use simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices for different time periods
    - Sub-thought: Use exponential moving average (EMA) of closing prices for different time periods
  - Sub-thought: Identify trend strengths
    - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between 20-day EMA and 50-day EMA as a trend strength indicator
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the rate of change (ROC) of the 50-day EMA to identify accelerating or decelerating trends
  - Sub-thought: Analyze price momentum
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the relative strength index (RSI) over the past 14 days
    - Sub-thought: Compute the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) using 12-day and 26-day EMAs
- Sub-thought: Examine volume dynamics
  - Sub-thought: Measure volume spikes
    - Sub-thought: Flag days with trading volume significantly higher than the 20-day moving average
  - Sub-thought: Assess volume-price relationship
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the correlation between daily volume and price changes over the past 30 days
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
    - Sub-thought: Compare the current day's close price to the VWAP
- Sub-thought: Incorporate high, low, and open prices
  - Sub-thought: Determine daily price range
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the daily range (high - low) and its ratio to the closing price
  - Sub-thought: Investigate opening price gaps
    - Sub-thought: Measure the difference between the opening price of the current day and the closing price of the previous day
- Sub-thought: Explore intraday volatility
  - Sub-thought: Calculate true range
    - Sub-thought: Use the maximum of (high - low), (high - previous close), (previous close - low) as the true range
  - Sub-thought: Compute average true range (ATR)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the 14-period ATR based on the true range
    - Sub-thought: Analyze the ratio of the ATR to the closing price to understand volatility
- Sub-thought: Combine factors
  - Sub-thought: Develop a composite factor
    - Sub-thought: Summarize multiple indicators into a single score
    - Sub-thought: Assign weights to each component based on historical performance
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate factor stability
    - Sub-thought: Conduct backtesting to assess the consistency of the factor over different market conditions
