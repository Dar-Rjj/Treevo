Thought: Utilize historical price data to identify trends and momentum as indicators for future stock returns.
- Sub-thought: Analyze closing prices over different time windows to detect short-term and long-term trends.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the current close and the N-day moving average of the close to gauge recent performance against a short-term trend. (N = 5, 10, 20, etc.)
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the slope of the M-day linear regression line of the closing prices to quantify the direction and strength of a medium-term trend. (M = 30, 50, 100, etc.)
- Sub-thought: Examine the relationship between opening and closing prices to measure market sentiment and volatility.
  - Sub-thought: Compute the percentage change from open to close, observing if the stock ends higher or lower than it started.
  - Sub-thought: Assess the range (high - low) relative to the daily average true range over the past K days to understand current day's volatility compared to recent history. (K = 14, 21, etc.)
- Sub-thought: Investigate volume changes in conjunction with price movements to infer buying/selling pressure.
  - Sub-thought: Determine the ratio of today's volume to the L-day simple moving average volume, highlighting significant deviations that may signal strong market activity. (L = 10, 20, etc.)
  - Sub-thought: Examine the correlation between the sign of the return (positive or negative) and the change in volume to see if there is a pattern of rising/falling volumes accompanying up/down moves.
- Sub-thought: Consider high and low prices for identifying potential support and resistance levels.
  - Sub-thought: Check if the latest closing price is near the H-day high/low to assess proximity to possible resistance/support areas. (H = 10, 20, etc.)
  - Sub-thought: Measure how frequently the stock hits new highs/lows over I days as an indicator of the underlying trend's strength. (I = 5, 10, etc.)
