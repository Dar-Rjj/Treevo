Weighted Momentum and Volatility Factor with Volume-Adjusted Returns
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Daily Returns
│   ├── Subtract Previous Day's Close from Current Day's Close
│   └── Divide by Previous Day's Close
│       └── Multiply by Volume
├── Calculate Weighted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 10-Day Moving Average of Volume-Adjusted Daily Returns
│   │   └── Exclude the Most Recent Return for Look-Back Calculation
│   └── Adjust for Volume Trend
│       ├── Compute 20-Day Exponential Moving Average of Volume
│       └── Divide 10-Day Moving Average by 20-Day EMA of Volume
└── Calculate Volatility
    ├── Compute 10-Day Standard Deviation of Daily Returns
    │   └── Exclude the Most Recent Return for Look-Back Calculation
    └── Sum Weighted Momentum and Inverse of Volatility
        └── Compute 1 over 10-Day Standard Deviation
            └── Add a Small Constant to 10-Day Standard Deviation
