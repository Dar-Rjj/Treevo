Thought: Develop alpha factors based on price and volume data
    Thought: Create a factor based on the relationship between closing and opening prices
        Thought: Calculate the daily return by dividing the closing price by the opening price
        Thought: Calculate the difference between the closing and opening price
        Thought: Analyze the trend of closing over opening price for the past n days
    Thought: Use high and low prices to create volatility-related factors
        Thought: Compute the average true range (ATR) over the last n days
            Thought: For each day, calculate the true range as max(high - low, abs(high - previous close), abs(low - previous close))
        Thought: Calculate the simple moving average of the ATR
        Thought: Determine the daily volatility as (high - low)
    Thought: Incorporate volume into factor development
        Thought: Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) incrementally
            Thought: If today's close > yesterday's close, add today's volume to OBV
            Thought: If today's close < yesterday's close, subtract today's volume from OBV
            Thought: If today's close == yesterday's close, make no change to OBV
        Thought: Examine the ratio of current day's volume to the n-day moving average volume
        Thought: Identify significant volume changes compared to the prior day
            Thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume from one day to the next
    Thought: Analyze patterns in price and volume together
        Thought: Create a factor that combines price movement and volume surge
            Thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price and the percentage change in volume
            Thought: Multiply these two values to get a combined effect
        Thought: Develop a factor that measures the strength of a move
            Thought: Calculate the absolute value of the price change divided by the average true range
            Thought: Adjust this value with the direction of the move (positive or negative)
    Thought: Explore additional time-based factors
        Thought: Construct a factor using the relative position of the close price within the high-low range
            Thought: Calculate (close - low) / (high - low) for each day
            Thought: Assess the trend of this ratio over the past n days
