Thought: Analyze price patterns for predictive signals
- Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between high and low prices (Intraday Range)
  - Sub-thought: Sum of Intraday Range over the past 5 days
    - Sub-thought: Compare with the previous 5-day sum to identify trends
      - Sub-thought: If the current 5-day sum is higher, it indicates increasing volatility
- Sub-thought: Calculate the close-to-open return (CtoOR)
  - Sub-thought: Average CtoOR over the past 7 days
    - Sub-thought: Determine if the average CtoOR is positive or negative
      - Sub-thought: Positive average CtoOR may indicate an upward trend
- Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume
  - Sub-thought: Percentage change in volume from the previous day
    - Sub-thought: If the volume increases significantly, it might indicate a significant move
- Sub-thought: Calculate the cumulative return over the past 10 days
  - Sub-thought: Cumulative return as a percentage
    - Sub-thought: If the cumulative return is positive, it may suggest a bullish trend
- Sub-thought: Calculate the distance between the current close and the 20-day moving average of the close
  - Sub-thought: If the current close is above the 20-day MA, it may indicate a bullish signal
- Sub-thought: Calculate the relative strength index (RSI) based on the past 14 days
  - Sub-thought: Use the RSI to identify overbought or oversold conditions
    - Sub-thought: If the RSI is below 30, it may indicate an oversold condition
- Sub-thought: Calculate the money flow index (MFI) based on the past 14 days
  - Sub-thought: Use the MFI to identify buying or selling pressure
    - Sub-thought: If the MFI is above 80, it may indicate a strong buying pressure
- Sub-thought: Calculate the accumulation/distribution line (A/D Line)
  - Sub-thought: The A/D Line can help identify the flow of money into or out of the stock
    - Sub-thought: If the A/D Line is rising, it may indicate accumulation
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) over the past 20 days
  - Sub-thought: Use the CMF to gauge the strength of the buying or selling pressure
    - Sub-thought: If the CMF is above 0, it may indicate a strong buying pressure
