│   ├── Compute Short-Term Weighted Moving Average of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Select N-Day Window (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   └── Use Close Prices
│   │   └── Apply Exponential Weights (Recent days have higher weight)
│   └── Compute Long-Term Weighted Moving Average of Close Prices
│       ├── Select M-Day Window (e.g., 20 days)
│       └── Use Close Prices
│       └── Apply Exponential Weights (Recent days have slightly higher weight)
│   └── Calculate the Difference between Short-Term WMA and Long-Term WMA
│       ├── Use Short-Term WMA
│       └── Use Long-Term WMA
├── Calculate Volume Rate of Change (VROC) Indicator
│   ├── Compute Percentage Change in Volume
│   │   ├── Choose Period (e.g., 14 days)
│   │   └── Use Volumes
│   └── Calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VROC
│       ├── Choose Smoothing Factor Alpha (e.g., 0.1)
│       └── Use VROC
├── Combine Adjusted Price Momentum and VROC Indicators
│   ├── Multiply Adjusted Price Momentum by EMA of VROC
│   │   ├── Use Adjusted Price Momentum Indicator
│   │   └── Use EMA of VROC
│   └── Assign Dynamic Weights to Each Indicator
│       ├── Adjust Weights Based on Volatility (e.g., Higher volatility, higher weight for momentum)
│       └── Use Historical Volatility (e.g., 10-day standard deviation)
└── Filter and Rank the Combined Indicator
    ├── Apply a Dynamic Threshold to Select Significant Values
    │   ├── Define Threshold as a Function of Market Conditions (e.g., based on market return)
    │   └── Use Combined Indicator
    └── Rank the Selected Values
        ├── Sort in Descending Order
        └── Introduce a Secondary Ranking Metric
            ├── Calculate the Correlation between Stock Returns and Market Returns
            │   ├── Compute Daily Logarithmic Returns
            │   │   └── Use Close Prices
            │   └── Compute Market Returns
            │       └── Use a Broad Market Index (e.g., S&P 500)
            └── Sort Stocks by Correlation with Market
                └── Give Priority to High Correlation in Ranking
