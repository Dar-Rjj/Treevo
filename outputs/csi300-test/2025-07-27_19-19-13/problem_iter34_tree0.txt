Thought: Synthesize alpha factors from price and volume data for predicting stock returns with intraday and daily adjustments
|-- Thought: Develop momentum-based alpha factors
|   |-- Sub-thought: Calculate the rate of change in closing price
|   |   |-- Sub-sub-thought: Daily return (close_t / close_(t-1) - 1)
|   |-- Sub-thought: Apply logarithmic transformation to returns
|       |-- Sub-sub-thought: Logarithmic return (log(close_t / close_(t-1)))
|-- Thought: Incorporate trading volume patterns
|   |-- Sub-thought: Investigate the ratio of today's volume to the previous day's volume
|   |   |-- Sub-sub-thought: Volume ratio (volume_t / volume_(t-1))
|   |-- Sub-thought: Weight price momentum by volume trend
|       |-- Sub-sub-thought: Volume-weighted log momentum (log(close_t / close_(t-1)) * (volume_t / volume_(t-1)))
|-- Thought: Analyze intraday price movements
|   |-- Sub-thought: Calculate the intraday return
|   |   |-- Sub-sub-thought: Intraday return ((high_t - low_t) / close_(t-1))
|   |-- Sub-thought: Measure intraday volatility
|       |-- Sub-sub-thought: Intraday volatility (high_t - low_t)
|-- Thought: Combine intraday and daily factors
|   |-- Sub-thought: Integrate intraday volatility and weighted intraday return
|       |-- Sub-sub-thought: Combined intraday factor (intraday_volatility + (intraday_return * (volume_t / volume_(t-1))))
|-- Thought: Incorporate trading amount
|   |-- Sub-thought: Combine with volume-weighted price momentum
|       |-- Sub-sub-thought: Amount-adjusted momentum (volume_weighted_log_momentum * (amount_t / amount_(t-1)))
|-- Thought: Aggregate past movements
|   |-- Sub-thought: Moving sum on adjusted intraday movements (N Days)
|   |   |-- Sub-sub-thought: Aggregated movements (sum(combined_intraday_factor, N days))
|   |-- Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of aggregated movements to average close over N Days
|       |-- Sub-sub-thought: Movement ratio (aggregated_movements / SMA_30_close)
|-- Thought: Integrate open-to-close return
    |-- Sub-thought: Conditionally adjust alpha factor
        |-- Sub-sub-thought: If open_to_close_return > 0, Adjusted factor = (movement_ratio * (1 + 0.7 * (close_t - open_t)))
        |-- Sub-sub-thought: If open_to_close_return < 0, Adjusted factor = (movement_ratio * (1 - 0.7 * abs(close_t - open_t)))
