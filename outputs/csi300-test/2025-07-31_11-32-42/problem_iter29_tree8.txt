Thought: Advanced Alpha Factor Synthesis
- Thought: Integrated Momentum and Trend Analysis
  - Sub-thought: SMA and EMA Crossover
    - Leaf: Calculate the 50-day SMA and 20-day EMA of closing prices, then compute the difference to identify trend reversals.
  - Sub-thought: 20-Day Average Close
    - Leaf: Use close prices (t-19, t-18, ..., t) to calculate the 20-day average close.
  - Sub-thought: Subtract 20-Day Average Close from Today's Close
    - Leaf: Compute the difference between today's close price and the 20-day average close.
- Thought: Enhanced Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Price Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Leaf: Evaluate the ROC using the close price over the last 14 days to measure momentum.
  - Sub-thought: Dynamic Price Momentum
    - Leaf: Calculate the 5-day moving average of close prices, subtract it from the current close price, and divide by the maximum of the 5-day close price range.
  - Sub-thought: Additional Momentum Indicators
    - Leaf: Calculate the 10-day moving average of close prices, subtract it from the current close price, and divide by the maximum of the 10-day close price range.
- Thought: Integrated Intraday Volatility
  - Sub-thought: High-Low Difference
    - Leaf: Use the high and low prices of day t to compute the intraday volatility.
  - Sub-thought: 5-Day Moving Average of High-Low Differences
    - Leaf: Compute the 5-day moving average of the high-low differences.
- Thought: Volume Analysis and Trends
  - Sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Leaf: Implement OBV by adding the day's volume to a cumulative total when the security's price closes up and subtracting it when the price closes down.
  - Sub-thought: Volume ROC
    - Leaf: Compute the rate of change in volume over 10 periods to gauge buying or selling pressure.
  - Sub-thought: 3-day Moving Average of Volume
    - Leaf: Calculate the 3-day moving average of volume.
  - Sub-thought: 7-day Moving Average of Volume
    - Leaf: Calculate the 7-day moving average of volume.
  - Sub-thought: Difference between 3-day and 7-day moving averages
    - Leaf: Compute the difference between the 3-day and 7-day moving averages of volume.
- Thought: Advanced Volume Impact
  - Sub-thought: Cube Root of Volume
    - Leaf: Compute the cube root of the daily volume.
  - Sub-thought: Multiply by Integrated Intraday and Open-to-Close Metric
    - Leaf: Divide the intraday volatility by the open-to-close movement and multiply by the cube root of volume.
- Thought: Adjusted Price Range as a Stability Measure
  - Sub-thought: Use (High - Low) / (Open + Close)
    - Leaf: Calculate the adjusted price range as (High - Low) / (Open + Close).
  - Sub-thought: Divide Advanced Volume Impact by this Ratio
    - Leaf: Divide the advanced volume impact by the adjusted price range.
- Thought: Final Alpha Factor
  - Sub-thought: Combine Integrated Momentum, Intraday Volatility, and Volume Trend
    - Leaf: Combine the integrated momentum, intraday volatility, and volume trend.
  - Sub-thought: Multiply by Advanced Volume Impact
    - Leaf: Multiply the combined factors by the advanced volume impact.
  - Sub-thought: Divide by Adjusted Price Range
    - Leaf: Divide the result by the adjusted price range.
  - Sub-thought: Add Integrated Momentum Indicators
    - Leaf: Add the 5-day and 10-day momentum indicators and divide by 2 to create a balanced momentum signal.
  - Sub-thought: Subtract 10-day Price Return from 5-day Price Return
    - Leaf: Subtract the 10-day price return from the 5-day price return.
