Integrated Alpha Factor with Enhanced Momentum, Volatility, and Volume Dynamics
├── Integrated Momentum
│   ├── 20-Day Average Close (t-19, t-18, ..., t)
│   └── Subtract from Today's Close (t)
├── Intraday Volatility
│   ├── High-Low Difference (t)
│   └── 5-Day Moving Average of High-Low Differences (t-4, t-3, ..., t)
├── Open-to-Close Movement
│   ├── Use Close Price (t)
│   └── Subtract Open Price (t)
├── Volume Trend
│   ├── 3-day Moving Average of Volume (t-2, t-1, t)
│   ├── 7-day Moving Average of Volume (t-6, t-5, ..., t)
│   └── Difference between 3-day and 7-day moving averages
├── Advanced Volume Impact
│   ├── Cube Root of Volume (t)
│   └── Multiply by Intraday Volatility / Open-to-Close Movement
├── Adjusted Price Range
│   ├── (High - Low) / (Open + Close) (t)
│   └── Divide Advanced Volume Impact by this Ratio
├── Dynamic Price Momentum
│   ├── 5-Day Moving Average of Close Price (t-4, t-3, ..., t)
│   ├── Subtract from Current Close Price (t)
│   └── Divide by Maximum 5-Day Close Price Range
├── Additional Momentum Indicators
│   ├── 10-Day Moving Average of Close Price (t-9, t-8, ..., t)
│   ├── Subtract from Current Close Price (t)
│   └── Divide by Maximum 10-Day Close Price Range
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Integrated Momentum, Intraday Volatility, and Volume Trend
    ├── Multiply by Advanced Volume Impact
    ├── Divide by Adjusted Price Range
    ├── Add Dynamic Price Momentum
    ├── Add Additional Momentum Indicators
    └── Subtract 10-day Price Return from 5-day Price Return
