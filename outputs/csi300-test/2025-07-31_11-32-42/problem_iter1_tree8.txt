High-Low Price Momentum with Volume Trend
├── Calculate High-Low Momentum
│   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Subtract the 5-day moving average of High price from today's High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract the 5-day moving average of Low price from today's Low price
│           └── Add the two differences to measure overall momentum
├── Measure Volume Trend
│   ├── Compute the 3-day and 7-day moving averages of Volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── For 3-day: Average volume over the past 3 days
│   │   └── For 7-day: Average volume over the past 7 days
│   └── Calculate the difference between 3-day and 7-day moving averages
│       └── If difference is positive, it indicates increasing volume trend; if negative, decreasing
└── Combine Momentum and Volume Trend
    ├── Multiply the High-Low Momentum by the Volume Trend
    └── The result indicates the strength of the price movement (momentum) weighted by the recent volume trend
