Volume Adjusted Momentum with Price Envelopment
├── Calculate Daily Price Movement
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       ├── Subtract Low from High for daily range
│       └── Add High and Low, then divide by 2 to get Midpoint
├── Calculate Multi-Day Average Midpoint
│   ├── Choose a window (e.g., 5 days)
│   ├── Calculate Midpoints for each day in the window
│   └── Take the arithmetic mean of these midpoints
├── Compute Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Calculate Close-to-Close Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Use previous Close price
│   └── Multiply Close-to-Close Return by Volume
├── Calculate Price Envelopment
│   ├── Calculate Multi-Day Range
│   │   ├── Sum of Daily Ranges over the same window
│   └── Calculate Multi-Day Volume
│       ├── Sum of Volumes over the same window
│       └── Divide Multi-Day Range by Multi-Day Volume
└── Combine Factors
    ├── Multiply Volume Adjusted Momentum by Price Envelopment
    └── This gives the final alpha factor
