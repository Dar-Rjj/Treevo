│   └── Subtract Open-to-Close Movement
├── Advanced Volume Impact
│   ├── Log of (Volume + 1)

├── Dynamic Weighting
│   ├── 5-Day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   ├── Sum of Volume of the last 5 days

│   ├── 5-Day Standard Deviation of Volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume of the last 5 days
│   │   └── Calculate standard deviation
│   ├── Z-Score for Current Volume
│   │   ├── Use Current Volume
│   │   └── Subtract 5-Day Moving Average, divide by 5-Day Standard Deviation
│   └── Apply Z-Score as a Weight to Volume-Adjusted Metric
├── Short-Term and Medium-Term Momentum
│   ├── Difference Between Today's Close and Yesterday's Close

├── Composite Indicators
│   ├── Momentum of Close Prices with Significant Volume Changes
│   └── Signal When Large Price Move Accompanied by Unusually High Volume
└── Final Integration
    ├── Integrated, Volume-Adjusted, and Stability-Adjusted Metric
