Volume Adjusted Momentum with Enhanced Price Envelopment
├── Calculate Daily Range and Midpoint
│   ├── Subtract Low from High for daily range
│   └── Add High and Low, then divide by 2 to get Midpoint
├── Calculate Multi-Day Average Midpoint
│   ├── Choose a window (e.g., 5 days)
│   ├── Calculate Midpoints for each day in the window
│   └── Take the arithmetic mean of these midpoints
├── Compute Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Calculate Close-to-Close Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Use previous Close price
│   └── Multiply Close-to-Close Return by Volume
├── Calculate Enhanced Price Envelopment
│   ├── Sum of Daily Ranges over the same window
│   ├── Sum of Volumes over the same window
│   ├── Divide Multi-Day Range by Multi-Day Volume to get Base Envelopment
│   └── Adjust Base Envelopment by adding a weighted sum of High and Low prices
│       └── Weighted Sum = (High + Low) / 2
└── Combine Factors
    ├── Multiply Volume Adjusted Momentum by Enhanced Price Envelopment
    └── This gives the final alpha factor
