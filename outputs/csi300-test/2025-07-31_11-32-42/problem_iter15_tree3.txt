Volume-Integrated Intraday and Opening Gap Analysis with Enhanced Volume Impact and Dynamic Price Movements
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Subtract Low price
├── Evaluate Open-to-Close Movement
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Open price
├── Integrate Intraday Volatility and Open-to-Close Movement
│   ├── Use Intraday Volatility
│   └── Divide by Open-to-Close Movement
├── Incorporate Advanced Volume Impact
│   ├── Use Cube Root of Volume
│   └── Multiply by Integrated Metric
├── Factor in Adjusted Price Range as a Stability Measure
│   ├── Use (High - Low) / (Open + Close)
│   └── Divide Integrated, Volume-Adjusted Metric by this Ratio
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Prices
│   ├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close
│   │   ├── Multiply each day's close price by its volume
│   │   └── Sum all the daily results
│   └── Calculate Volume-Weighted Open
│       ├── Multiply each day's open price by its volume
│       └── Sum all the daily results
├── Synthesize VWAPCHL into the Model
│   ├── Subtract Volume-Weighted Open from Volume-Weighted Close
│   └── Divide by (High - Low)
└── Introduce Dynamic Price Momentum
    ├── Calculate 5-Day Moving Average of Close Price
    ├── Subtract 5-Day Moving Average from Current Close Price
    └── Divide by the Maximum of the 5-Day Close Price Range
