Thought: Base Alpha Factor Generation
- Thought: Trend Analysis
  - Sub-thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    - Leaf: Calculate the SMA of closing prices over 50 days to identify long-term trend.
  - Sub-thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    - Leaf: Use a 20-day EMA on closing prices for smoother short-term trend signal.
- Thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Price Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Leaf: Evaluate the ROC using the close price over the last 14 days to measure momentum.
  - Sub-thought: Acceleration Band
    - Leaf: Apply acceleration bands, which are moving averages set at specific multiples above and below a simple moving average, to identify potential breakouts.
- Thought: Volume Analysis
  - Sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Leaf: Implement OBV by adding the day's volume to a cumulative total when the security's price closes up and subtracting it when the price closes down.
  - Sub-thought: Volume ROC
    - Leaf: Compute the rate of change in volume over 10 periods to gauge buying or selling pressure.
- Thought: Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Average True Range (ATR)
    - Leaf: Find ATR over 14 days to measure market volatility, aiding in identifying stop-loss levels.
  - Sub-thought: Standard Deviation
    - Leaf: Calculate the standard deviation of closing prices over 20 days as a quantification of volatility.
- Thought: Market Sentiment
  - Sub-thought: High-Low Spread
    - Leaf: Analyze the difference between high and low prices each day to infer market sentiment, with wider spreads indicating higher uncertainty or volatility.
  - Sub-thought: Close-to-High Ratio
    - Leaf: Measure the ratio of the closing price to the daily high; a closer value to 1 suggests strength, while a lower ratio indicates weakness.
- Thought: Value Indicator
  - Sub-thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI) 
    - Leaf: Compute RSI with a 14-day window to assess if the stock is overbought or oversold.
  - Sub-thought: Money Flow Index (MFI)
    - Leaf: Determine the MFI over 14 days, which incorporates both price and volume to reflect the buying or selling pressure.
