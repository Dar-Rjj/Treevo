- Analyze historical price and volume patterns
  - Calculate moving averages (SMA and EMA)
    - Use simple moving average (SMA) for 5, 10, 20, 50 days
    - Use exponential moving average (EMA) for 5, 10, 20, 50 days
    - Compute the difference between SMA and EMA to identify trend strength
  - Evaluate price momentum
    - Calculate price change over 1, 5, and 10 day intervals
    - Assess the rate of change (ROC) over 1, 5, and 10 day periods
    - Determine the momentum crossover by comparing ROCs of different intervals
- Utilize volume and amount data
  - Measure volume trends
    - Calculate average volume over 5, 10, and 20 day periods
    - Identify volume spikes relative to the 5, 10, and 20 day average
  - Assess the relationship between volume and price
    - Determine on-balance volume (OBV) to track cumulative buying and selling
    - Calculate the OBV change over 1 and 5 day intervals
- Incorporate high and low prices for volatility and range analysis
  - Calculate daily range (high - low)
  - Compute average true range (ATR) over 14 days to measure market volatility
  - Calculate the ratio of daily range to ATR to identify significant moves
- Analyze opening and closing prices
  - Calculate the difference between open and close prices
  - Determine the percentage gap (open - close) / open
  - Assess the frequency of positive and negative gaps over a 10 day period
- Combine multiple factors
  - Experiment with different combinations and weights of individual factors
  - Develop a composite score based on weighted factors
  - Introduce conditional logic to refine factor signals (e.g., if the price is above/below certain moving averages)
- Explore additional price and volume interactions
  - Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) over 1, 5, and 10 day periods
  - Assess the distance of current price from VWAP as an indicator of value
