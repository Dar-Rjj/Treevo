Intraday and Opening Gap Analysis with Enhanced Volume-Weighted Metrics, Dynamic Weighting, and Integrated Momentum
├── Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Open-to-Close Movement
│   ├── Subtract Open from Close
├── Integrated Intraday and Opening Gaps
│   ├── Use Intraday High-Low Spread
│   └── Subtract Open-to-Close Movement
├── Advanced Volume Impact
│   ├── Log of (Volume + 1)
│   └── Multiply by Integrated Metric
├── Adjusted Price Range as a Stability Measure
│   ├── (High - Low) / (Open + Close)
│   └── Divide Integrated, Volume-Adjusted Metric by this Ratio
├── Volume-Weighted Prices
│   ├── Volume-Weighted Close
│   │   ├── Multiply each day's close price by its volume
│   │   └── Sum all the daily results
│   └── Volume-Weighted Open
│       ├── Multiply each day's open price by its volume
│       └── Sum all the daily results
├── VWAPCHL into the Model
│   ├── Subtract Volume-Weighted Open from Volume-Weighted Close
│   └── Divide by (High - Low)
├── Volume-Weighted Momentum
│   ├── Volume-Weighted Average Price
│   │   ├── Multiply each day's close and open prices by their volume
│   │   ├── Add the two sums
│   │   └── Divide by the total volume
│   └── Change in Volume-Weighted Average Price
│       ├── Current Volume-Weighted Average Price
│       └── Subtract Previous Day's Volume-Weighted Average Price
├── Dynamic Weighting
│   ├── 5-Day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   ├── Sum of Volume of the last 5 days
│   │   └── Divide by 5
│   ├── 5-Day Standard Deviation of Volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume of the last 5 days
│   │   └── Calculate standard deviation
│   ├── Z-Score for Current Volume
│   │   ├── Use Current Volume
│   │   └── Subtract 5-Day Moving Average, divide by 5-Day Standard Deviation
│   └── Apply Z-Score as a Weight to Volume-Adjusted Metric
├── Momentum Component
│   ├── Simple Moving Average of Close prices over N days
│   └── Subtract SMA from current Close price
└── Final Integration
    ├── Integrated, Volume-Adjusted, and Stability-Adjusted Metric
