Integrated Momentum, Intraday Volatility, Volume Trend, and Price Envelopment Alpha Factor with Open-to-Close Movement and Volume-Weighted Analysis
├── Calculate Integrated Momentum
│   ├── 20-Day Average Close
│   │   └── Use Close Prices (t-19, t-18, ..., t)
│   ├── Subtract 20-Day Average Close from Today's Close
│   │   └── Use Close Price of Day t
│   └── High-Low Momentum
│       ├── 5-day Moving Average of High price
│       │   └── Subtract from today's High price
│       ├── 5-day Moving Average of Low price
│       │   └── Subtract from today's Low price
│       └── Add the two differences for overall momentum
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── High-Low Difference
│   │   ├── Use High Price of Day t
│   │   └── Use Low Price of Day t
│   └── 5-Day Moving Average of High-Low Differences
│       └── Use High-Low Differences (t-4, t-3, ..., t)
├── Measure Volume Trend
│   ├── 3-day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   └── Average volume over the past 3 days
│   ├── 7-day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   └── Average volume over the past 7 days
│   └── Difference between 3-day and 7-day moving averages
├── Evaluate Open-to-Close Movement
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Open price
├── Integrate Intraday and Opening Gaps
│   ├── Use Intraday High-Low Spread
│   └── Subtract Open-to-Close Movement
├── Incorporate Advanced Volume Impact
│   ├── Use Square Root of Volume
│   └── Multiply by Integrated Metric
├── Factor in Adjusted Price Range as a Stability Measure
│   ├── Use (High - Low) / (Open + Close)
│   └── Divide Integrated, Volume-Adjusted Metric by this Ratio
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Prices
│   ├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close
│   │   ├── Multiply each day's close price by its volume
│   │   └── Sum all the daily results
│   └── Calculate Volume-Weighted Open
│       ├── Multiply each day's open price by its volume
│       └── Sum all the daily results
├── Synthesize VWAPCHL into the Model
│   ├── Subtract Volume-Weighted Open from Volume-Weighted Close
│   └── Divide by (High - Low)
└── Final Integration
    ├── Use Integrated, Volume-Adjusted, and Stability-Adjusted Metric
    ├── Multiply by VWAPCHL
    ├── Add Integrated Momentum
    ├── Add Intraday Volatility
    ├── Multiply by Volume Trend
    ├── Subtract 10-day Price Return from 5-day Price Return
    ├── Subtract 50-day Price Return from 20-day Price Return
    ├── Subtract 10-day Average Volume from 5-day Average Volume
    ├── Multiply short-term and long-term price momentum differences
    └── Multiply with the volume surge difference and the Volume Adjusted Momentum
        └── Multiply by Price Envelopment
