Integrated High-Low and Close Price Momentum with Volume Activity and Trend
├── Calculate Integrated Price Momentum
│   ├── High-Low Momentum
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   │   └── Subtract the 5-day moving average of High price from today's High price
│   │   └── Use Low price
│   │       └── Subtract the 5-day moving average of Low price from today's Low price
│   │           └── Add the two differences to measure overall high-low momentum
│   ├── 1-day Close Price Momentum
│   │   ├── Use Close price (t)
│   │   └── Use Close price (t-1)
│   │       └── Subtract t-1 close price from t close price
│   └── 5-day Close Price Momentum
│       ├── Use Close price (t)
│       └── Use Close price (t-5)
│           └── Subtract t-5 close price from t close price
│   └── 20-day Close Price Momentum
│       ├── Use Close price (t)
│       └── Use Close price (t-20)
│           └── Subtract t-20 close price from t close price
├── Measure Volume Trend and Activity
│   ├── Compute the 3-day and 7-day moving averages of Volume
│   │   ├── For 3-day: Average volume over the past 3 days
│   │   └── For 7-day: Average volume over the past 7 days
│   ├── Calculate the difference between 3-day and 7-day moving averages
│   │   └── If difference is positive, it indicates increasing volume trend; if negative, decreasing
│   └── Volume Activity Indicator
│       ├── 1-day Volume Difference
│       │   ├── Use Volume (t)
│       │   └── Use Volume (t-1)
│       │       └── Subtract t-1 volume from t volume
│       ├── 5-day Average Volume
│       │   ├── Sum Volume (t-4 to t)
│       │   └── Divide by 5
│       └── 20-day Average Volume
│           ├── Sum Volume (t-19 to t)
│           └── Divide by 20
└── Combine Momentum, Volume Trend, and Volume Activity
    ├── Multiply High-Low Momentum by 1-day Volume Difference
    ├── Multiply 1-day Close Price Momentum by 1-day Volume Difference
    ├── Multiply 5-day Close Price Momentum by 5-day Average Volume
    ├── Multiply 20-day Close Price Momentum by 20-day Average Volume
    └── Multiply the combined High-Low Momentum and Volume Trend by the combined Close Price Momentum and Volume Activity
        └── The result indicates the strength of the price movement (momentum) weighted by the recent volume trend and activity
