Thought: Develop a set of integrated alpha factors combining momentum, volatility, and volume dynamics to predict future stock returns.
    Sub-Thought 1: Calculate enhanced momentum indicators from the given (open, high, low, close) prices.
        Sub-Thought 1.1: Compute the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices over N days.
            Sub-Thought 1.1.1: Use Close Prices (t-N+1, t-N+2, ..., t)
        Sub-Thought 1.2: Determine the rate of change (ROC) for the closing prices over M days.
            Sub-Thought 1.2.1: Use Close Price of Day t
        Sub-Thought 1.3: Calculate the relative strength (RS) by comparing the average gain and loss over P days.
            Sub-Thought 1.3.1: For each day, calculate the daily gain if the close is higher than the previous close.
            Sub-Thought 1.3.2: For each day, calculate the daily loss if the close is lower than the previous close.
            Sub-Thought 1.3.3: Compute the average gain and average loss over P days.
            Sub-Thought 1.3.4: Use the average gain and average loss to compute the RS.
        Sub-Thought 1.4: Calculate the momentum (MOM) of the closing prices over Q days.
            Sub-Thought 1.4.1: Use Close Price of Day t
        Sub-Thought 1.5: Subtract 20-Day Average Close from Today's Close
            Sub-Thought 1.5.1: Use Close Prices (t-19, t-18, ..., t)
            Sub-Thought 1.5.2: Use Close Price of Day t
        Sub-Thought 1.6: Dynamic Price Momentum
            Sub-Thought 1.6.1: Calculate 5-Day Moving Average of Close Price
                Sub-Thought 1.6.1.1: Use Close Prices (t-4, t-3, ..., t)
            Sub-Thought 1.6.2: Subtract 5-Day Moving Average from Current Close Price
                Sub-Thought 1.6.2.1: Use Close Price of Day t
            Sub-Thought 1.6.3: Divide by the Maximum of the 5-Day Close Price Range
        Sub-Thought 1.7: Additional Momentum Indicators
            Sub-Thought 1.7.1: Calculate 10-Day Moving Average of Close Price
                Sub-Thought 1.7.1.1: Use Close Prices (t-9, t-8, ..., t)
            Sub-Thought 1.7.2: Subtract 10-Day Moving Average from Current Close Price
                Sub-Thought 1.7.2.1: Use Close Price of Day t
            Sub-Thought 1.7.3: Divide by the Maximum of the 10-Day Close Price Range
    Sub-Thought 2: Incorporate advanced volume-related features to enhance the alpha factors.
        Sub-Thought 2.1: Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP).
            Sub-Thought 2.1.1: For each day, compute the typical price as (high + low + close) / 3.
            Sub-Thought 2.1.2: Multiply the typical price by the volume for each day.
            Sub-Thought 2.1.3: Sum the products from Sub-Thought 2.1.2 and divide by the total volume over R days.
        Sub-Thought 2.2: Determine the volume rate of change (VROC) over S days.
            Sub-Thought 2.2.1: Use Volume of Day t
        Sub-Thought 2.3: Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) using the closing prices and volume.
            Sub-Thought 2.3.1: If the close is higher than the previous close, add the current volume to OBV.
            Sub-Thought 2.3.2: If the close is lower than the previous close, subtract the current volume from OBV.
            Sub-Thought 2.3.3: If the close is equal to the previous close, do not change OBV.
        Sub-Thought 2.4: Volume Trend
            Sub-Thought 2.4.1: 3-day Moving Average of Volume
                Sub-Thought 2.4.1.1: Use Volume (t-2, t-1, t)
