Volume-Integrated Intraday and Opening Gap Analysis with Enhanced Volume Impact, Dynamic Price Movements, and Extended Momentum Indicators
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Subtract Low price
├── Evaluate Open-to-Close Movement
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Open price
├── Integrate Intraday Volatility and Open-to-Close Movement
│   ├── Use Intraday Volatility
│   └── Divide by Open-to-Close Movement
├── Incorporate Advanced Volume Impact
│   ├── Use Cube Root of Volume
│   └── Multiply by Integrated Metric
├── Factor in Adjusted Price Range as a Stability Measure
│   ├── Use (High - Low) / (Open + Close)
│   └── Divide Integrated, Volume-Adjusted Metric by this Ratio
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Prices
│   ├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close
│   │   ├── Multiply each day's close price by its volume
│   │   └── Sum all the daily results
│   └── Calculate Volume-Weighted Open
│       ├── Multiply each day's open price by its volume
│       └── Sum all the daily results
├── Synthesize VWAPCHL into the Model
│   ├── Subtract Volume-Weighted Open from Volume-Weighted Close
│   └── Divide by (High - Low)
├── Introduce Dynamic Price Momentum
│   ├── Calculate 5-Day Moving Average of Close Price
│   ├── Subtract 5-Day Moving Average from Current Close Price
│   └── Divide by the Maximum of the 5-Day Close Price Range
├── Enhance with Additional Momentum Indicators
│   ├── Calculate 10-Day Moving Average of Close Price
│   ├── Subtract 10-Day Moving Average from Current Close Price
│   └── Divide by the Maximum of the 10-Day Close Price Range
└── Integrate Momentum Indicators
    ├── Combine 5-Day and 10-Day Momentum Indicators
    │   ├── Add 5-Day Momentum Indicator
    │   └── Add 10-Day Momentum Indicator
    └── Divide by 2 to Create a Balanced Momentum Signal
