├── Evaluate Open-to-Close Movement
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Open price
├── Integrate Intraday and Opening Gaps
│   ├── Use Intraday High-Low Spread
│   └── Subtract Open-to-Close Movement
├── Incorporate Advanced Volume Impact
│   ├── Use Log of (Volume + 1)
│   └── Multiply by Integrated Metric
├── Factor in Adjusted Price Range as a Stability Measure
│   ├── Use (High - Low) / (Open + Close)
│   └── Divide Integrated, Volume-Adjusted Metric by this Ratio
└── Synthesize VWAPCHL into the Model
    ├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close
    │   ├── Multiply each day's close price by its volume
