Thought: Develop a set of alpha factors based on price and volume data to potentially predict future returns.
    Sub-Thought 1: Calculate momentum indicators from the given (open, high, low, close) prices.
        Sub-Thought 1.1: Compute the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices over N days.
        Sub-Thought 1.2: Determine the rate of change (ROC) for the closing prices over M days.
        Sub-Thought 1.3: Calculate the relative strength (RS) by comparing the average gain and loss over P days.
            Sub-Thought 1.3.1: For each day, calculate the daily gain if the close is higher than the previous close.
            Sub-Thought 1.3.2: For each day, calculate the daily loss if the close is lower than the previous close.
            Sub-Thought 1.3.3: Compute the average gain and average loss over P days.
            Sub-Thought 1.3.4: Use the average gain and average loss to compute the RS.
        Sub-Thought 1.4: Calculate the momentum (MOM) of the closing prices over Q days.
    Sub-Thought 2: Incorporate volume-related features to enhance the alpha factors.
        Sub-Thought 2.1: Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP).
            Sub-Thought 2.1.1: For each day, compute the typical price as (high + low + close) / 3.
            Sub-Thought 2.1.2: Multiply the typical price by the volume for each day.
            Sub-Thought 2.1.3: Sum the products from Sub-Thought 2.1.2 and divide by the total volume over R days.
        Sub-Thought 2.2: Determine the volume rate of change (VROC) over S days.
        Sub-Thought 2.3: Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) using the closing prices and volume.
            Sub-Thought 2.3.1: If the close is higher than the previous close, add the current volume to OBV.
            Sub-Thought 2.3.2: If the close is lower than the previous close, subtract the current volume from OBV.
            Sub-Thought 2.3.3: If the close is equal to the previous close, do not change OBV.
    Sub-Thought 3: Generate volatility-based factors to capture market uncertainty.
        Sub-Thought 3.1: Compute the true range (TR) for each day.
            Sub-Thought 3.1.1: Calculate the maximum of (high - low), (high - previous close), and (previous close - low).
        Sub-Thought 3.2: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over T days.
        Sub-Thought 3.3: Determine the standard deviation of closing prices over U days.
    Sub-Thought 4: Create factors that capture the relationship between opening and closing prices.
        Sub-Thought 4.1: Calculate the open-close ratio (OCR) as (close / open).
        Sub-Thought 4.2: Compute the gap size (GS) as (open - previous close).
