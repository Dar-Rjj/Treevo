Integrated Intraday and Momentum Analysis with Volume and Stability Adjustments
├── Integrated Momentum
│   ├── 20-Day Average Close
│   │   └── Use Close Prices (t-19, t-18, ..., t)
│   └── Subtract 20-Day Average Close from Today's Close
│       └── Use Close Price of Day t
├── Intraday Volatility
│   ├── High-Low Difference
│   │   ├── Use High Price of Day t
│   │   └── Use Low Price of Day t
│   └── 5-Day Moving Average of High-Low Differences
│       └── Use High-Low Differences (t-4, t-3, ..., t)
├── Open-to-Close Movement
│   ├── Use Close price of Day t
│   └── Subtract Open price of Day t
├── Integrated Intraday and Open-to-Close Metric
│   ├── Use Intraday Volatility
│   └── Divide by Open-to-Close Movement
├── Volume Trend
│   ├── 3-day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   └── Average volume over the past 3 days
│   ├── 7-day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   └── Average volume over the past 7 days
│   └── Difference between 3-day and 7-day moving averages
├── Advanced Volume Impact
│   ├── Use Log of (Volume + 1)
│   └── Multiply by Integrated Intraday and Open-to-Close Metric
├── Adjusted Price Range as a Stability Measure
│   ├── Use (High - Low) / (Open + Close) of Day t
│   └── Divide Advanced Volume Impact by this Ratio
├── Dynamic Price Momentum
│   ├── Calculate 5-Day Moving Average of Close Price
│   ├── Subtract 5-Day Moving Average from Current Close Price
│   └── Divide by the Maximum of the 5-Day Close Price Range
├── Additional Momentum Indicators
│   ├── Calculate 10-Day Moving Average of Close Price
│   ├── Subtract 10-Day Moving Average from Current Close Price
│   └── Divide by the Maximum of the 10-Day Close Price Range
├── Integrate Momentum Indicators
│   ├── Combine 5-Day and 10-Day Momentum Indicators
│   │   ├── Add 5-Day Momentum Indicator
│   │   └── Add 10-Day Momentum Indicator
│   └── Divide by 2 to Create a Balanced Momentum Signal
├── Short-Term Price Return
│   ├── 5-Day Price Return
│   │   └── (Close Price of Day t / Close Price of Day t-5) - 1
│   ├── 10-Day Price Return
│   │   └── (Close Price of Day t / Close Price of Day t-10) - 1
│   └── Subtract 10-day Price Return from 5-day Price Return
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Integrated Momentum, Intraday Volatility, and Volume Trend
    ├── Multiply by Advanced Volume Impact
    ├── Divide by Adjusted Price Range
    ├── Add Integrated Momentum Indicators
    ├── Multiply by Short-Term Price Return
    └── Subtract 10-day Price Return from 5-day Price Return
