Combined Momentum, Volume, and Intraday Volatility Indicator
├── Calculate Short-Term and Long-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-day Price Return: (Close_t / Close_t-5) - 1
│   └── Compute 20-day Price Return: (Close_t / Close_t-20) - 1
├── Calculate Volume Surge
│   ├── Compute 5-day Average Volume: (Volume_t + ... + Volume_t-4) / 5
│   └── Compute 10-day Average Volume: (Volume_t + ... + Volume_t-9) / 10
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Difference: High_t - Low_t
│   └── Calculate 5-Day Moving Average of High-Low Differences: (High-Low_Diff_t + ... + High-Low_Diff_t-4) / 5
└── Combine Factors
    ├── Subtract 20-day Price Return from 5-day Price Return: 5-day_Price_Return - 20-day_Price_Return
    ├── Subtract 10-day Average Volume from 5-day Average Volume: 5-day_Avg_Volume - 10-day_Avg_Volume
    ├── Multiply short-term momentum and volume surge differences: (5-day_Price_Return - 20-day_Price_Return) * (5-day_Avg_Volume - 10-day_Avg_Volume)
    └── Add Intraday Volatility to the previous result: (Intraday_Volatility) + ((5-day_Price_Return - 20-day_Price_Return) * (5-day_Avg_Volume - 10-day_Avg_Volume))
