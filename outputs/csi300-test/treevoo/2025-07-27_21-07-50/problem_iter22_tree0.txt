Thought: Develop Alpha Factors Based on Enhanced Price and Volume Characteristics
- Thought: Momentum and Trend Analysis
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the weighted average of the last 10 days' closing prices, with more recent prices having a higher weight.
  - Sub-thought: Determine the rate of change in the closing price over the past 5 days, adjusted for the day's trading volume.
  - Sub-thought: Compute the cumulative sum of the daily returns over the past 20 days, applying a moving average to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
- Thought: Volume Anomaly and Surge Detection
  - Sub-thought: Identify days where the volume significantly increases or decreases compared to its 30-day moving average.
  - Sub-thought: Measure the ratio of today's volume to the maximum volume over the past 40 days, to provide a longer-term perspective.
- Thought: Price Volatility and Stability
  - Sub-thought: Compute the standard deviation of the daily closing prices for the past 20 days, considering only the last 10 days to emphasize recent volatility.
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the average true range (ATR) over the last 14 periods, using high, low, and close prices, and compare it to the 14-period ATR 14 days ago.
  - Sub-thought: Assess the ratio of the highest high to the lowest low over the past 20 days, and calculate the same ratio for the most recent 10 days to gauge short-term stability.
- Thought: Reversal and Continuation Patterns
  - Sub-thought: Detect days where a bearish or bullish engulfing pattern occurs, and check if the pattern is confirmed by a gap in the following day.
  - Sub-thought: Look for days with a hammer or hanging man candlestick formation, and evaluate if the next day's close is higher or lower than the pattern day's close.
  - Sub-thought: Identify days with a bullish or bearish harami pattern, and assess the volume on the day following the pattern.
- Thought: Liquidity and Trading Activity
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of trading volume to the amount traded, and compare it to the 20-day moving average of the same ratio.
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the ratio of the volume of the most recent up day to the volume of the most recent down day, and compare it to the 20-day moving average of this ratio.
