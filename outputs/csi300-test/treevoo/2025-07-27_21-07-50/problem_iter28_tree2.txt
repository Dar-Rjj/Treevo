Thought: Analyze historical price patterns for predictive insights
- Sub-thought: Examine the relationship between current and past prices
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close
    - Formula: `Close_t - Close_{t-1}`
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between today's close and the 5-day moving average of closes
    - Formula: `Close_t - (Sum(Close_{t-4} to Close_t) / 5)`
- Sub-thought: Explore intraday price dynamics
  - Sub-thought: Determine the range of daily price movement
    - Formula: `High_t - Low_t`
  - Sub-thought: Measure the volatility of the stock by calculating the average true range over a period
    - Formula: `Average(High_t - Low_t, |High_t - Close_{t-1}|, |Low_t - Close_{t-1}|) over 14 days`
- Sub-thought: Investigate volume trends
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the 20-day average volume
    - Formula: `Volume_t / (Sum(Volume_{t-19} to Volume_t) / 20)`
  - Sub-thought: Determine if there is a significant increase or decrease in volume compared to the previous day
    - Formula: `(Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}) / Volume_{t-1}`
- Sub-thought: Consider the interaction between price and volume
  - Sub-thought: Assess the money flow into or out of the stock
    - Formula: `Money_Flow = Typical_Price * Volume` where `Typical_Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3`
    - Formula: `Money_Flow_Index = Sum(Positive Money Flow over 14 days) / Sum(Negative Money Flow over 14 days)`
