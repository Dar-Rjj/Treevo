Thought: Synthesized Alpha Factors Integrating Price, Volume, and Trend Dynamics
- Thought: Momentum and Trend Analysis
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the weighted average of the last 10 days' closing prices, with more recent prices having a higher weight.
  - Sub-thought: Determine the rate of change in the closing price over the past 5 days, adjusted for the day's trading volume.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the return over the past 10, 20, and 50 days
  - Sub-thought: Combine the returns into a single momentum score
    -- Sub-sub-thought: Sum the weighted returns to get the momentum score (weights: 0.5 for 10-day, 0.3 for 20-day, 0.2 for 50-day)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate 20-day Momentum: (Close - Close[20])
  - Sub-thought: Scale by 20-day Volatility: (Close - Close[20]) / std(Close, 20)
- Thought: Volume Anomaly and Surge Detection
  - Sub-thought: Identify days where the volume significantly increases or decreases compared to its 30-day moving average.
  - Sub-thought: Measure the ratio of today's volume to the maximum volume over the past 40 days, to provide a longer-term perspective.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the average volume over the past 10 days
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price from the previous day
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the price-volume indicator
    -- Sub-sub-thought: Multiply the percentage change in closing price by the ratio of today's volume to the average volume
  - Sub-thought: Compute Intraday Log-Return: log(Close / Open)
  - Sub-thought: Divide by High-Low Range and Adjust using Square Root of Volume: log(Close / Open) / (High - Low) * sqrt(Volume)
- Thought: Price Volatility and Stability
  - Sub-thought: Compute the standard deviation of the daily closing prices for the past 20 days, considering only the last 10 days to emphasize recent volatility.
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the average true range (ATR) over the last 14 periods, using high, low, and close prices, and compare it to the 14-period ATR 14 days ago.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the daily log returns
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the standard deviation of the daily log returns over the past 30 days
  - Sub-thought: Use the standard deviation as the volatility factor
  - Sub-thought: Enhanced Volatility Correction
    -- Sub-sub-thought: Subtract price volatility from the volume-adjusted intraday return
    -- Sub-sub-thought: Subtract volume volatility from the volume-adjusted intraday return
- Thought: Reversal and Continuation Patterns
  - Sub-thought: Detect days where a bearish or bullish engulfing pattern occurs, and check if the pattern is confirmed by a gap in the following day.
  - Sub-thought: Look for days with a hammer or hanging man candlestick formation, and evaluate if the next day's close is higher or lower than the pattern day's close.
- Thought: Liquidity and Trading Activity
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of trading volume to the amount traded, and compare it to the 20-day moving average of the same ratio.
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the ratio of the volume of the most recent up day to the volume of the most recent down day, and compare it to the 20-day moving average of this ratio.
- Thought: Long-Term and Short-Term Trends
  - Sub-thought: Long-Term Trend
    -- Sub-sub-thought: Moving average of close prices over an extended lookback period (e.g., 50 days)
  - Sub-thought: Short-Term Trend
    -- Sub-sub-thought: Exponential moving average of close prices over a short lookback period (e.g., 10 days)
  - Sub-thought: Determine Trend Difference
    -- Sub-sub-thought: Subtract short-term trend from long-term trend
  - Sub-thought: Adjust the corrected intraday momentum factor
    -- Sub-sub-thought: If the trend difference is positive, multiply the corrected factor by a positive adjustment factor (e.g., 1.2)
    -- Sub-sub-thought: If the trend difference is negative, multiply the corrected factor by a negative adjustment factor (e.g., 0.8)
- Thought: Intraday Return Component
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Intraday Return: (Close - Open) / Open
  - Sub-thought: Integrate Volume into Intrad
