Crossover of Relative Price Movement Strength and Volume-Adjusted Momentum with Price Reversal Signal

├── Calculate High-Low Spread Ratio
│   ├── Use High price
│   ├── Use Low price
│   └── Calculate (High - Low) / (High + Low)

├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close-Open Difference
│   ├── Calculate Close-Open Difference
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Use Open price
│   └── Weight by Volume
│       ├── Use Volume
│       └── Multiply by Close-Open Difference

├── Integrate Both Factors
│   ├── Combine High-Low Spread Ratio and Volume-Weighted Close-Open Difference
│   └── Compute the Product of Both Values

├── Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close prices
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Set SMA period (e.g., 21 days)

├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close Price
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Use Volume
│       └── Adjust by multiplying close price by its volume

├── Calculate Short-Term Reversal
│   ├── Use Open and Close prices to compute daily returns
│   └── Aggregate past n-day (e.g., 5 days) returns

├── Composite Alpha Factor
│   ├── Combine SMAs, adjusted close, and short-term reversal
│   │   ├── Subtract SMA from volume-weighted close
│   │   └── Add short-term reversal

└── Final Integration
    ├── Combine the Integrated Factors and the Composite Alpha Factor
    │   ├── Add the product of High-Low Spread Ratio and Volume-Weighted Close-Open Difference
    │   └── Add the Composite Alpha Factor
    └── Interpretation: The factor combines the strength of relative price movements, volume-adjusted momentum, and short-term reversal signals, providing a comprehensive view of stock performance. Positive values suggest a potential uptrend, while negative ones indicate a downtrend.
