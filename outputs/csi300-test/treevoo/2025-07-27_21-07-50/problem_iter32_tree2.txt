Thought: Analyze historical price patterns for predictive insights
- Sub-thought: Examine the relationship between current and past prices
  - Formula: `Close_t - Close_{t-1}`
  - Formula: `Close_t - (Sum(Close_{t-4} to Close_t) / 5)`
  - Formula: `Close_t - (Max(Close_{t-10} to Close_t) - Min(Close_{t-10} to Close_t))`
- Sub-thought: Explore intraday price dynamics
  - Formula: `High_t - Low_t`
  - Formula: `Average(High_t - Low_t, |High_t - Close_{t-1}|, |Low_t - Close_{t-1}|) over 14 days`
  - Formula: `Abs((High_t - Low_t) - (High_{t-1} - Low_{t-1}))`
- Sub-thought: Investigate volume trends
  - Formula: `Volume_t / (Sum(Volume_{t-19} to Volume_t) / 20)`
  - Formula: `(Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}) / Volume_{t-1}`
  - Formula: `Volume_t - Average(Volume_{t-20} to Volume_t)`
- Sub-thought: Consider the interaction between price and volume
  - Formula: `Money_Flow = (High + Low + Close) / 3 * Volume`
  - Formula: `Money_Flow_Index = Sum(Positive Money Flow over 14 days) / Sum(Negative Money Flow over 14 days)`
  - Formula: `Money_Flow_Volatility = StandardDeviation(Money_Flow over 14 days)`
