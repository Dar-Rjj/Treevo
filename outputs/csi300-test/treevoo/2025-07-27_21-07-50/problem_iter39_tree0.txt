  Thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over a short period (e.g., 14 days)
    Thought: Compute the ratio of the ATR to the closing price
      Thought: Use this ratio as an alpha factor, indicating the stock's price volatility
Thought: Examine price range and gaps
  Thought: Calculate the daily price range (high - low)
    Thought: Sum the daily price ranges over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
      Thought: Use this sum as an alpha factor, representing the stock's price volatility over the period
  Thought: Identify days where the open price is significantly different from the previous day's close price
