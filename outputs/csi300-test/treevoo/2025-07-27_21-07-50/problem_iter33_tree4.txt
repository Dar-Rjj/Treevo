Develop Alpha Factors Based on Enhanced Price, Volume, and Intraday Characteristics
- Momentum and Trend Analysis
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the Last 10 Days' Closing Prices with Higher Weights for Recent Prices
  - Rate of Change in the Closing Price Over the Past 5 Days, Adjusted by the Day's Trading Volume
- Volume Anomaly and Surge Detection
  - Identify Days Where the Volume Significantly Increases or Decreases Compared to Its 20-Day Moving Average
  - Measure the Ratio of Today's Volume to the Maximum Volume Over the Past 30 Days
- Price Volatility and Stability
  - Standard Deviation of the Daily Closing Prices for the Past 20 Days, Considering Only the Last 7 Days to Emphasize Very Recent Volatility
  - Average True Range (ATR) Over the Last 14 Periods, Using High, Low, and Close Prices, and Compare It to the 14-Period ATR 10 Days Ago
- Reversal and Continuation Patterns
  - Detect Bearish or Bullish Engulfing Patterns and Check if Confirmed by a Gap in the Following Day
  - Look for Morning Star or Evening Star Candlestick Formations, and Evaluate if the Next Day's Close is Higher or Lower Than the Pattern Day's Close
- Liquidity and Trading Activity
  - Ratio of Trading Volume to the Amount Traded, and Compare It to the 10-Day Moving Average of the Same Ratio
  - Ratio of the Volume of the Most Recent Up Day to the Volume of the Most Recent Down Day, and Compare It to the 10-Day Moving Average of This Ratio
- Intraday Volatility
  - High-Low Spread: High - Low
  - Open-Close Spread: Close - Open
  - Sum of Spreads * Volume
- Volume-Weighted Close
  - Close * Volume
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Volume-Weighted Close (21 Days)
- Composite Alpha Factor
  - Volume-Weighted Close - EMA of Volume-Weighted Close
  - + Intraday Volatility
  - + Short-Term Reversal
  - + VAMI
