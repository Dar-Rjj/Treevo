Crossover of Alpha Factors for Predicting Future Stock Returns

- Momentum Factors
  - Simple Moving Averages Crossovers
    - Difference between 5-day and 20-day moving averages
    - Signal: Positive when short MA crosses above long MA, negative otherwise
  - Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Measure the percentage change in price over a specified period, e.g., ROC(12)
- Volume Based Momentum
  - Ratio of average volume in recent days to longer term average
  - Indicator increases with higher recent activity compared to historical, signaling potential trend acceleration

- Reversal Factors
  - Mean Reversion after Oversold Conditions
    - Use RSI (Relative Strength Index) without normalization
      - Look for RSI below a threshold indicating oversold condition
      - Expectation of mean reversion leading to positive returns
  - Bollinger Bands Squeeze
    - Calculate standard deviation of closing prices over a given period
    - Narrowing Bollinger Bandwidth suggests decreasing volatility, setting up for a breakout

- Market Sentiment Indicators
  - Money Flow Index (MFI) Analysis
    - MFI measures buying and selling pressure
    - High MFI levels indicate bullishness, low MFI signals bearishness
  - Acc/Dis Distribution Line
    - Tracks the relationship between volume and price to gauge institutional buying/selling
    - Rising line indicates accumulation (bullish), falling line points to distribution (bearish)

- Hybrid Factors
  - Combining Momentum with Breakout Confirmation
    - Identify stocks in uptrend using momentum factors
    - Confirm with breakout through resistance levels on increased volume
  - Integration of Volume and Price Patterns
    - Apply price patterns like 'Cup and Handle' for potential breakouts
    - Ensure pattern is validated by significant increase in trading volume
  - Enhanced Sentiment-Momentum Blend
    - Utilize MFI alongside ROC or SMA crossover signals
    - For instance, look for a bullish MFI setup just as momentum turns positive
- Seasonality & Calendar Effects
  - January Effect Factor
    - Small cap outperformance in January
    - Construct a portfolio weighted towards small caps entering January
  - Turn-of-the-Month Effect
    - Historically, markets tend to show strength at the end and beginning of months
    - Time-adjusted strategy focusing on specific windows within these periods
- Volatility Based Strategies
  - Implied vs. Realized Volatility Spread
    - When implied volatility significantly exceeds realized volatility, it might indicate undervaluation or overvaluation in the market
  - VIX as an Anticipatory Indicator
    - Spikes in VIX often precede market bottoms; drops can signal complacency
- Earnings and News Impact Assessment
  - Abnormal Returns Post Earnings Announcement
    - Track immediate post-earnings price movement to exploit delayed reaction
  - Sentiment Analysis from News Headlines
    - Automated sentiment scoring of relevant financial news
    - Strongly positive/negative headlines may prelude significant moves
