        └── Else, Indicate Bearish Trend
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   ├── Use Close price

│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Compute Absolute Daily Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Use Previous Close price
│   ├── Sum Absolute Daily Returns over 20 days
│   └── Divide by 20
├── Calculate Volume Thrust
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Use Previous Volume
│       ├── Check if Current Volume is greater than Previous Volume
│       │   └── If true, Assign 1

└── Final Adjusted Factor
    ├── Use Volume Thrust
    └── Multiply the final factor by the volume thrust
├── Calculate 5-day SMA of Volume
└── Evaluate the change in 5-day SMA of Volume as a potential indicator of liquidity and interest
    ├── If 5-day SMA of Volume increases, Indicate Higher Liquidity
    └── Else, Indicate Lower Liquidity
├── Calculate Daily Price Range (High - Low)
└── Compute the Average Daily Price Range over the past 20 days
    ├── Calculate the ratio of today's Daily Price Range to the 20-day Average Daily Price Range
    └── If ratio > 1, Indicate Increased Volatility
        └── Else, Indicate Decreased Volatility
├── Assess the gap between Open and Close Prices
└── Analyze the distribution and frequency of positive versus negative gaps
    ├── If positive gap, Indicate Positive Sentiment
    └── If negative gap, Indicate Negative Sentiment
├── Calculate the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for each day
└── Use VWAP to identify significant deviations from the average price
    ├── Compare VWAP trends with simple moving averages to highlight divergences
    ├── If VWAP > 20-day SMA, Indicate Bullish Divergence
    └── If VWAP < 20-day SMA, Indicate Bearish Divergence
├── Compute the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) based on close prices
└── Evaluate overbought and oversold conditions using RSI
    ├── Integrate RSI with SMA signals to filter out potential false breakout signals
    ├── If RSI > 70, Indicate Overbought Condition
    └── If RSI < 30, Indicate Oversold Condition
├── Calculate the standard deviation of high, low, and close prices over the last 30 days
└── Examine the ratio of the 30-day standard deviation to the daily return
    ├── Use the volatility factor to adjust risk exposure in the trading strategy
    ├── If ratio > threshold, Indicate High Risk
    └── Else, Indicate Low Risk
├── Track the net amount traded at the bid versus the ask
└── Measure the imbalance ratio over a specific period
    ├── Relate the imbalance ratio to subsequent price movements
