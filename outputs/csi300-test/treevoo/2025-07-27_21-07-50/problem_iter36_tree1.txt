Thought: Synthesize historical price and volume patterns with momentum and volatility for predictive insights
- Sub-thought: Examine the relationship between current and past prices
  - Formula: `Close_t - Close_{t-1}`
  - Formula: `Close_t - (Sum(Close_{t-4} to Close_t) / 5)`
- Sub-thought: Explore intraday price dynamics
  - Formula: `High_t - Low_t`
  - Formula: `Average(High_t - Low_t, |High_t - Close_{t-1}|, |Low_t - Close_{t-1}|) over 14 days`
- Sub-thought: Investigate volume trends
  - Formula: `Volume_t / (Sum(Volume_{t-19} to Volume_t) / 20)`
  - Formula: `(Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}) / Volume_{t-1}`
- Sub-thought: Consider the interaction between price and volume
  - Formula: `Money_Flow = (High + Low + Close) / 3 * Volume`
  - Formula: `Money_Flow_Index = Sum(Positive Money Flow over 14 days) / Sum(Negative Money Flow over 14 days)`
- Sub-thought: Calculate the momentum factor
  - Compute the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices over a 14-day period
  - Subtract the SMA of the closing prices over a 50-day period from the 14-day SMA
- Sub-thought: Assess the volatility using historical price data
  - Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns over a 20-day window
- Sub-thought: Incorporate trading volume into the analysis
  - Compute the ratio of the 7-day moving average of the trading volume to the 21-day moving average of the trading volume
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the money flow index
  - Define typical price as the average of high, low, and close for each day
  - Calculate the raw money flow by multiplying the typical price with the corresponding daily volume
  - Determine the positive and negative money flow over a 14-day period
  - Calculate the Money Flow Ratio (MFR) as the sum of 14-day positive money flow divided by the sum of 14-day negative money flow
  - Compute the Money Flow Index (MFI) as 100 - (100 / (1 + MFR))
- Sub-thought: Analyze the relative strength
  - Calculate the relative strength (RS) as the ratio of the 14-day EMA of the closing price to the 200-day EMA of the closing price
- Sub-thought: Consider the open interest in futures and options
  - Sum the daily changes in open interest over a 30-day period
- Sub-thought: Factor combination
  - Combine the above factors using a weighted sum
  - Assign weights based on their perceived predictive power
- Sub-thought: Enhance the factor combination
  - Introduce a non-linear transformation to the combined factors
  - Apply a logistic function to the weighted sum to create a bounded output
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the market sentiment
  - Calculate the cumulative sum of the daily differences between the close and open prices over a 10-day period
- Sub-thought: Incorporate the market breadth
  - Calculate the advance-decline line by summing the daily difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks over a 20-day period
- Sub-thought: Factor integration
  - Combine all the enhanced and new factors into a final composite factor
  - Use a weighted sum with dynamic weights based on the recent performance of each factor
- Sub-thought: Include the impact of high-frequency trading
  - Formula: `High_Frequency_Trading_Impact = (High_t - Low_t) / (Volume_t / 1000000)`
- Sub-thought: Analyze the gap between open and close prices
  - Formula: `Gap_Size = |Open_t - Close_{t-1}|`
  - Formula: `Average_Gap_Size_Over_10_Days = Average(Gap_Size, 10)`
- Sub-thought: Incorporate the effect of large trades
  - Formula: `Large_Trade_Effect = (Volume_t > 2 * Average(Volume_{t-19} to Volume_t)) ? 1 : 0`
- Sub-thought: Examine the trend consistency
  - Formula: `Trend_Consistency = (Close_t - Close_{t-25}) / 25`
- Sub-thought: Consider the impact of overnight returns
  - Formula: `Overnight_Return = (Open_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}`
