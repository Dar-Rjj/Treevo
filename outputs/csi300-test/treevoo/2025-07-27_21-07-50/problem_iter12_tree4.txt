Thought: Construct alpha factors using price and volume data
    Sub-thought: Calculate momentum-based indicators
        Sub-thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) of close prices over different time periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50 days)
        Sub-thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of close prices over different time periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50 days)
        Sub-thought: Rate of change (ROC) of close prices over various time frames (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50 days)
        Sub-thought: Momentum of close prices over a specific period (e.g., 14 days)
    Sub-thought: Calculate volatility-based indicators
        Sub-thought: Standard Deviation (SD) of close prices over different time periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50 days)
        Sub-thought: Average True Range (ATR) over a specific period (e.g., 14 days) using high, low, and close prices
        Sub-thought: Bollinger Bands: upper and lower bands based on 2 standard deviations from the SMA
    Sub-thought: Calculate volume-based indicators
        Sub-thought: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) over a specific period (e.g., 1 day)
        Sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV) to track the cumulative trading volume
        Sub-thought: Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) over a specific period (e.g., 20 days) using high, low, and volume
    Sub-thought: Calculate market sentiment indicators
        Sub-thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI) over a specific period (e.g., 14 days)
        Sub-thought: Stochastic Oscillator %K and %D over a specific period (e.g., 14 days) using high, low, and close prices
        Sub-thought: Williams %R over a specific period (e.g., 14 days) using high, low, and close prices
    Sub-thought: Combine multiple indicators
        Sub-thought: Create a composite factor by summing up or averaging the standardized values of selected momentum, volatility, volume, and sentiment indicators
        Sub-thought: Create interaction terms between different indicators to capture non-linear relationships
            Sub-thought: Multiply ROC and ATR to create a combined momentum-volatility factor
            Sub-thought: Multiply OBV and RSI to create a combined volume-sentiment factor
        Sub-thought: Use machine learning models to derive new factors
            Sub-thought: Train a linear regression model on historical data to predict future returns
            Sub-thought: Train a random forest model on historical data to predict future returns
            Sub-thought: Use the feature importance from the random forest model to identify the most influential factors
