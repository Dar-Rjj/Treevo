  - Sub-thought: Determine the rate of change in the closing price over the past 7 days, adjusted for the day's trading volume.
- Thought: Volume Anomaly and Surge Detection
  - Sub-thought: Identify days where the volume significantly increases or decreases compared to its 20-day moving average.
  - Sub-thought: Measure the ratio of today's volume to the maximum volume over the past 30 days, to provide a shorter-term perspective.
- Thought: Price Volatility and Stability
  - Sub-thought: Compute the standard deviation of the daily closing prices for the past 15 days, considering only the last 8 days to emphasize very recent volatility.
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the average true range (ATR) over the last 10 periods, using high, low, and close prices, and compare it to the 10-period ATR 10 days ago.
- Thought: Reversal and Continuation Patterns
  - Sub-thought: Detect days where a bearish or bullish engulfing pattern occurs, and check if the pattern is confirmed by a gap in the following day.
  - Sub-thought: Look for days with a doji candlestick formation, and evaluate if the next day's close is higher or lower than the pattern day's close.
- Thought: Liquidity and Trading Activity
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of trading volume to the amount traded, and compare it to the 15-day moving average of the same ratio.
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the ratio of the volume of the most recent up day to the volume of the most recent down day, and compare it to the 15-day moving average of this ratio.
