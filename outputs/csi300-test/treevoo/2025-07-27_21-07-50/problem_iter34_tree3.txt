- Calculate the momentum factor
  - Subtract the 50-day SMA of the closing prices from the 14-day SMA
- Assess the volatility using historical price data
  - Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns over a 20-day window
- Incorporate trading volume into the analysis
  - Compute the ratio of the 7-day moving average of the trading volume to the 21-day moving average
- Evaluate the money flow index
  - Define typical price as the average of high, low, and close for each day
  - Determine the positive and negative money flow over a 14-day period
  - Calculate the Money Flow Ratio (MFR) as the sum of 14-day positive money flow divided by the sum of 14-day negative money flow
  - Compute the Money Flow Index (MFI) as 100 - (100 / (1 + MFR))
