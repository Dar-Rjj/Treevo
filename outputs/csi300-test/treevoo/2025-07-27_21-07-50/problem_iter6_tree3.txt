└── Final VPA-MRF
    ├── Multiply Volume Adjusted Price Change by Momentum and Reversal Interaction
    ├── Divide by Volume and Price Adjusted Factor
    └── Output VPA-MRF
        ├── Higher VPA-MRF indicates strong momentum with reversal
        └── Lower VPA-MRF indicates weak momentum with or without reversal
