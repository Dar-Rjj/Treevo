Calculate High-Low Spread Ratio
├── Use High price
├── Use Low price
└── Calculate (High - Low) / (High + Low)

Volume-Weighted Close-Open Difference
├── Use Open price
├── Use Close price
├── Use Volume
└── Multiply (Close - Open) by Volume

Average of Both Factors
├── Combine High-Low Spread Ratio and Volume-Weighted Close-Open Difference
└── Compute the Average of Both Values

Volume-Adjusted EMA Factor
├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close prices
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Set EMA period (e.g., 21 days)
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close Price
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Use Volume
│       └── Adjust by multiplying close price by its volume
└── Subtract EMA from volume-weighted close

Medium-Term Reversal Factor
├── Use Open and Close prices to compute daily returns
└── Aggregate past m-day (e.g., 10 days) returns, then take the average

Intraday Log-Return
├── Use Open price
└── Use Close price

True Range
├── Use High price
├── Use Low price
└── Use Previous Day's Close price

Scaled Intraday Log-Return
├── Use Intraday Log-Return
└── Scale by True Range

Volume Impact
├── Compute Volume Change
│   ├── Use Current Volume
│   └── Use Previous Day's Volume
└── Multiply Volume Change with the Scaled Intraday Log-Return

Weighted Final Integration
├── Assign weights to each factor
│   ├── High-Low Spread Ratio: 0.2
│   ├── Volume-Weighted Close-Open Difference: 0.2
│   ├── Volume-Adjusted EMA Factor: 0.3
│   ├── Medium-Term Reversal Factor: 0.1
│   └── Volume Impact: 0.2
└── Compute the weighted sum of all factors

Interpretation: The factor combines the strength of relative price movements, volume-adjusted momentum, medium-term reversal signals, and intraday volatility adjusted return with volume impact, providing a comprehensive view of stock performance. Positive values suggest a potential uptrend, while negative ones indicate a downtrend.
