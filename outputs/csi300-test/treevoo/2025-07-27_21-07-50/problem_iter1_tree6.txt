Volume-Adjusted Momentum with Price Reversal Signal
├── Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close prices
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Set SMA period (e.g., 21 days)
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close Price
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Use Volume
│       └── Adjust by multiplying close price by its volume
├── Calculate Short-Term Reversal
│   ├── Use Open and Close prices to compute daily returns
│   └── Aggregate past n-day (e.g., 5 days) returns
└── Composite Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine SMAs, adjusted close, and short-term reversal
    │   ├── Subtract SMA from volume-weighted close
    │   └── Add short-term reversal
    └── Interpretation: The factor identifies stocks where recent price momentum, weighted by trading volume, is supported by a short-term reversal signal hinting at possible continuation or change in trend. Positive values suggest a potential uptrend, while negative ones indicate a downtrend.
