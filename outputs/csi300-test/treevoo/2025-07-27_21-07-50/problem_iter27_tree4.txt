Thought: Develop Alpha Factors Based on Enhanced Price and Volume Characteristics
- Thought: Momentum and Trend Analysis
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) of the last 10 days' closing prices, with a smoothing factor that emphasizes recent prices.
  - Sub-thought: Determine the rate of change in the closing price over the past 5 days, adjusted for the day's trading volume and the 5-day average volume.
- Thought: Volume Anomaly and Surge Detection
  - Sub-thought: Identify days where the volume significantly increases or decreases compared to its 21-day moving average, and flag these as potential anomaly days.
  - Sub-thought: Measure the ratio of today's volume to the maximum volume over the past 30 days, to provide a longer-term perspective and identify significant volume spikes.
- Thought: Price Volatility and Stability
  - Sub-thought: Compute the standard deviation of the daily closing prices for the past 15 days, considering only the last 7 days to emphasize very recent volatility.
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the average true range (ATR) over the last 14 periods, using high, low, and close prices, and compare it to the 14-period ATR 7 days ago.
- Thought: Reversal and Continuation Patterns
  - Sub-thought: Detect days where a bearish or bullish engulfing pattern occurs, and check if the pattern is confirmed by a gap in the following day. Additionally, evaluate the strength of the pattern by the size of the candles.
  - Sub-thought: Look for days with a hammer or hanging man candlestick formation, and evaluate if the next day's close is higher or lower than the pattern day's close. Also, consider the position of the pattern within the current trend.
- Thought: Liquidity and Trading Activity
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of trading volume to the amount traded, and compare it to the 14-day moving average of the same ratio to identify changes in liquidity.
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the ratio of the volume of the most recent up day to the volume of the most recent down day, and compare it to the 14-day moving average of this ratio to assess buying and selling pressure.
