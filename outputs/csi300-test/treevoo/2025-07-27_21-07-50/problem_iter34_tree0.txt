        Sub-Thought: Calculate the VWAP over a period (e.g., 20 days)
            Sub-Thought: Sum the daily (close * volume) over 20 days and divide by the total volume over 20 days
    Sub-Thought: Use the amount traded as a proxy for liquidity
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the average daily amount traded over a period (e.g., 20 days)
