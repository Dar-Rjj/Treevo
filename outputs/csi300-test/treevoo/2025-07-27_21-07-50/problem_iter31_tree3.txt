Thought: Construct Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume Data
- Sub-Thought: Use Opening, High, Low, Closing Prices to Calculate Daily Momentum
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the daily return using close price
    - Sub-Thought: (Close[t] - Close[t-1]) / Close[t-1]
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate Volume into Price Movement for Trading Activity Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV) to gauge buying and selling pressure
    - Sub-Thought: OBV[t] = OBV[t-1] + Volume[t] * sign(Close[t] - Close[t-1])
- Sub-Thought: Identify Volatility Clusters Using High-Low Spread
  - Sub-Thought: Measure the range of daily trading as an indicator of volatility
    - Sub-Thought: High[t] - Low[t]
- Sub-Thought: Utilize Open and Close Prices to Assess Market Sentiment
  - Sub-Thought: Determine the difference between open and close prices for sentiment analysis
    - Sub-Thought: Close[t] - Open[t]
- Sub-Thought: Integrate Amount Data to Analyze Transaction Size Influence
  - Sub-Thought: Compare the amount traded with volume to infer average transaction size
    - Sub-Thought: Amount[t] / Volume[t]
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the change in average transaction size over time
    - Sub-Thought: (Amount[t] / Volume[t]) - (Amount[t-1] / Volume[t-1])
- Sub-Thought: Apply Moving Averages to Smoothing Price Data
  - Sub-Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices to identify trends
    - Sub-Thought: SMA(5)[t] = (Close[t] + Close[t-1] + Close[t-2] + Close[t-3] + Close[t-4]) / 5
  - Sub-Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of closing prices for more recent data weighting
    - Sub-Thought: EMA(t) = (Close[t] * alpha) + (EMA[t-1] * (1 - alpha)), where alpha = 2 / (n+1), n=5
- Sub-Thought: Detect Pattern Changes Through Price and Volume Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: Implement a breakout strategy using high and low prices
    - Sub-Thought: If (High[t] > max(High[t-1],...,High[t-20])) OR (Low[t] < min(Low[t-1],...,Low[t-20]))

This improved thought tree presents a structured, pruned, and focused approach to generating alpha factors. It starts with a broad idea and progressively delves into specific, actionable sub-thoughts that can be used to construct novel and interpretable alpha factors.
