Thought: Synthesize momentum, price-volume trend, and volatility factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate the momentum factor using closing prices
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the return over the past 10 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the return over the past 20 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the return over the past 50 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Combine the returns into a single momentum score
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Sum the weighted returns to get the momentum score (weights: 0.5 for 10-day, 0.3 for 20-day, 0.2 for 50-day)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the price-volume trend
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the average volume over the past 10 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price from the previous day
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the price-volume indicator
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Multiply the percentage change in closing price by the ratio of today's volume to the average volume
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the moving average of the price-volume indicator over the past 20 days
- Sub-thought: Calculate the volatility factor
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the daily log returns
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the standard deviation of the daily log returns over the past 30 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Use the standard deviation as the volatility factor
- Sub-thought: Synthesize a combined factor
-- Sub-sub-thought: Combine the momentum, price-volume trend, and volatility factors into a single composite factor
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Assign equal weights to each factor
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Sum the weighted factors to get the composite factor

Thought: Synthesize RSI and MFI factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate the relative strength index (RSI)
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the average gain and average loss over the past 14 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the relative strength (RS)
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Divide the average gain by the average loss
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the RSI
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Use the formula: 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
-- Sub-sub-thought: Smooth the RSI using an exponential moving average over the past 14 days
- Sub-thought: Calculate the money flow index (MFI)
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the typical price (average of high, low, and close)
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the raw money flow (typical price * volume)
-- Sub-sub-thought: Determine positive and negative money flow
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Positive money flow when typical price is greater than the previous day
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Negative money flow when typical price is less than the previous day
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the money flow ratio
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Divide the sum of positive money flow by the sum of negative money flow over the past 14 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the MFI
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Use the formula: 100 - (100 / (1 + money flow ratio))
- Sub-thought: Synthesize a combined factor
-- Sub-sub-thought: Combine the RSI and MFI factors into a single composite factor
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Assign equal weights to each factor
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Sum the weighted factors to get the composite factor

Thought: Synthesize all factors
- Sub-thought: Combine the composite momentum, price-volume, and volatility factor with the composite RSI and MFI factor
-- Sub-sub-thought: Assign equal weights to each composite factor
-- Sub-sub-thought: Sum the weighted composite factors to get the final synthesized factor
