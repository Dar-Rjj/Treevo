Thought: Calculate the momentum factor using closing prices
- Sub-thought: Calculate the return over the past 10, 20, and 50 days
- Sub-thought: Combine the returns into a single momentum score
-- Sub-sub-thought: Assign weights to each return period (e.g., 0.5 for 10-day, 0.3 for 20-day, 0.2 for 50-day)
-- Sub-sub-thought: Sum the weighted returns to get the momentum score

Thought: Calculate the price-volume trend
- Sub-thought: Calculate the average volume over the past 10 days
- Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price from the previous day
- Sub-thought: Calculate the price-volume indicator
-- Sub-sub-thought: Multiply the percentage change in closing price by the ratio of today's volume to the average volume
- Sub-thought: Calculate the moving average of the price-volume indicator over the past 20 days

Thought: Calculate the volatility factor
- Sub-thought: Calculate the daily log returns
- Sub-thought: Calculate the standard deviation of the daily log returns over the past 30 days

Thought: Calculate the relative strength index (RSI)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the average gain and average loss over the past 14 days
- Sub-thought: Calculate the relative strength (RS)
-- Sub-sub-thought: Divide the average gain by the average loss
- Sub-thought: Calculate the RSI
-- Sub-sub-thought: Use the formula: 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

Thought: Calculate the money flow index (MFI)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the typical price (average of high, low, and close)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the raw money flow (typical price * volume)
- Sub-thought: Determine positive and negative money flow
-- Sub-sub-thought: Positive money flow when typical price is greater than the previous day
-- Sub-sub-thought: Negative money flow when typical price is less than the previous day
- Sub-thought: Calculate the money flow ratio
-- Sub-sub-thought: Divide the sum of positive money flow by the sum of negative money flow over the past 14 days
- Sub-thought: Calculate the MFI
-- Sub-sub-thought: Use the formula: 100 - (100 / (1 + money flow ratio))
