- Calculate the momentum factor
  - Compute the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices over a 14-day period
  - Subtract the SMA of the closing prices over a 50-day period from the 14-day SMA
- Assess the volatility using historical price data
  - Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns over a 20-day window
- Incorporate trading volume into the analysis
  - Compute the ratio of the 7-day moving average of the trading volume to the 21-day moving average of the trading volume
- Evaluate the money flow index
  - Define typical price as the average of high, low, and close for each day
  - Calculate the raw money flow by multiplying the typical price with the corresponding daily volume
  - Determine the positive and negative money flow over a 14-day period
  - Calculate the Money Flow Ratio (MFR) as the sum of 14-day positive money flow divided by the sum of 14-day negative money flow
  - Compute the Money Flow Index (MFI) as 100 - (100 / (1 + MFR))
- Analyze the relative strength
  - Calculate the relative strength (RS) as the ratio of the 14-day EMA of the closing price to the 200-day EMA of the closing price
- Consider the open interest in futures and options
  - Sum the daily changes in open interest over a 30-day period
- Factor combination
  - Combine the above factors using a weighted sum
  - Assign weights based on their perceived predictive power
- Enhance the factor combination
  - Introduce a non-linear transformation to the combined factors
  - Apply a logistic function to the weighted sum to create a bounded output
- Evaluate the market sentiment
  - Calculate the cumulative sum of the daily differences between the close and open prices over a 10-day period
- Incorporate the market breadth
  - Calculate the advance-decline line by summing the daily difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks over a 20-day period
- Factor integration
  - Combine all the enhanced and new factors into a final composite factor
  - Use a weighted sum with dynamic weights based on the recent performance of each factor
