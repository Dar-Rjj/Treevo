Thought: Synthesize Momentum, Volatility, and Volume Adjusted Factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Multi-period Weighted Momentum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the return over the past 10 days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the return over the past 20 days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the return over the past 50 days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Combine the returns into a single momentum score
    -- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Sum the weighted returns to get the momentum score (weights: 0.5 for 10-day, 0.3 for 20-day, 0.2 for 50-day)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Intraday Volatility and Volume Impact
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate High-Low Spread: (High - Low)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate Open-Close Spread: (Close - Open)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Combine and Weight Spreads: (High-Low + Open-Close) * sqrt(Volume)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Intraday Log-Return Scaled by Volatility
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute Intraday Log-Return: log(Close / Open)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Scale by High-Low Range: log(Close / Open) / (High - Low)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Volume Adjusted Momentum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Daily Price Change: (Close - Open)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume Adjusted Price Change
    -- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Multiply by Volume: (Close - Open) * Volume
    -- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Sum over 20 days
  - Sub-sub-thought: 20-day Moving Average of Volume
    -- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute 20-day MA of Volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate Combined Alpha
    -- Sub-sub-sub-thought: Add Scaled Log-Return to VAMI: (log(Close / Open) / (High - Low)) + (Sum of Volume Adjusted Price Change / 20-day MA of Volume)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 20-day Scaled Momentum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate 20-day Momentum: (Close - Close[20])
  - Sub-sub-thought: Scale by 20-day Standard Deviation: (Close - Close[20]) / std(Close, 20)
- Sub-thought: Final Alpha Combination
  - Sub-sub-thought: Combine Intraday Volatility, Scaled Log-Return, VAMI, and Momentum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Final Alpha: (Combined Alpha) + (Scaled 20-day Momentum)
