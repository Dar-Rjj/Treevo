Thought: Exploring Volume and Price Dynamics for Alpha Factor Generation
    Thought: Utilizing Volume Information for Insight
        Thought: Volume Change Over Period
            Thought: Calculate the daily volume change (Volume[t] - Volume[t-1])
        Thought: Volume Relative to Moving Average
            Thought: Calculate 20-day moving average of volume
            Thought: Determine the ratio of current day's volume to its 20-day moving average
    Thought: Analyzing Price Patterns
        Thought: Simple Moving Averages
            Thought: Calculate 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day simple moving averages of close prices
            Thought: Compute the difference between 5-day and 20-day SMAs
        Thought: Price Change Analysis
            Thought: Calculate the daily price change (Close[t] - Close[t-1])
            Thought: Consider the percentage change in closing price
        Thought: High-Low Range Indicator
            Thought: Calculate the high-low range (High[t] - Low[t])
            Thought: Use the ratio of today's high-low range to yesterday's
    Thought: Integrating Price and Volume
        Thought: Price-Volume Trend
            Thought: Combine the daily price change with the daily volume change
            Thought: Evaluate if the trend is supported by volume
        Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
            Thought: If Close[t] > Close[t-1], then OBV[t] = OBV[t-1] + Volume[t]
            Thought: If Close[t] < Close[t-1], then OBV[t] = OBV[t-1] - Volume[t]
            Thought: If Close[t] == Close[t-1], then OBV[t] = OBV[t-1]
