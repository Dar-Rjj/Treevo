Thought: Utilize basic price and volume information to create interpretable alpha factors
  Thought: Calculate momentum factor using the past returns
    Thought: Use simple return from t-1 day to t-30 as a short-term momentum indicator
    Thought: Use logarithmic return from t-1 day to t-90 as a medium-term momentum indicator
    Thought: Use compounded return from t-1 day to t-180 as a long-term momentum indicator
  Thought: Design reversal or mean reversion strategies
    Thought: Calculate the difference between the current close and the highest high of the last 21 days
    Thought: Determine the distance of the current close from the 250-day moving average
    Thought: Compute the ratio of the current close to the exponential moving average (EMA) of the last 40 days
  Thought: Integrate volume with price for enhanced signals
    Thought: Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) up to day t
    Thought: Derive the cumulative volume delta, which is the sum of (close - open) * volume up to day t
    Thought: Define a volume surprise factor by comparing today's volume to the average of the last 15 days
  Thought: Incorporate volatility and trend strength
    Thought: Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over the past 25 days as a measure of volatility
    Thought: Compute the average true range (ATR) over the past 21 days as an indicator of volatility
    Thought: Use the slope of a linear regression of the past 75 days' closing prices to measure trend strength
  Thought: Combine multiple indicators into a composite score
    Thought: Create a weighted sum of the short, medium, and long-term momentum indicators
    Thought: Develop a composite reversal signal from the three calculated mean reversion factors
    Thought: Formulate a combined factor by adding the OBV, volume delta, and volume surprise with appropriate weights
  Thought: Experiment with alternative calculations based on existing ideas
    Thought: Explore the use of the median instead of the mean in calculations involving historical data
    Thought: Consider non-linear transformations of simple returns, such as square root or power, before aggregation
    Thought: Implement a modified version of ATR that also accounts for the gap between opening and closing prices, and the absolute value of the difference
