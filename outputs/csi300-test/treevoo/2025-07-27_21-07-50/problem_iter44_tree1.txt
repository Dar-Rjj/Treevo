Thought: Explore Price Patterns
- Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between opening and closing prices
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the close price of day t and the open price of day t
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change from the open price to the close price of day t
- Sub-thought: Investigate high and low price dynamics
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the range (high - low) of day t
  - Sub-thought: Determine the position of the close price relative to the high and low of day t (close - low) / (high - low)
- Sub-thought: Examine volume and amount interactions
  - Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of the amount to the volume for day t
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the change in volume from day t-1 to day t
  - Sub-thought: Consider the trend in volume over the past n days (e.g., a moving average of volume)
- Sub-thought: Incorporate multi-day patterns
  - Sub-thought: Look at the cumulative sum of daily returns over the past n days
  - Sub-thought: Analyze the momentum based on the highest and lowest prices over the past n days
  - Sub-thought: Create a factor that reflects the volatility, such as the standard deviation of returns over the past n days
- Sub-thought: Develop composite factors
  - Sub-thought: Combine the open-close difference with the high-low range to create a composite price movement indicator
  - Sub-thought: Integrate the volume changes with the price movements to form a more comprehensive market activity gauge
