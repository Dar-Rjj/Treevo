Thought: Synthesize the relationship between trading volume, price changes, and pricing patterns to predict future stock returns
- Sub-thought: Explore the impact of daily trading volume on stock prices
  - Factor = (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t * Volume_t
- Sub-thought: Analyze the effect of consecutive high and low pricing patterns on future returns
  - Factor = (High_t - Max(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})) / Max(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})
  - Factor = (Low_t - Min(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})) / Min(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the influence of the average amount transacted on stock performance
  - Factor = Amount_t / Average(Amount_{t-9},...,Amount_{t-1})
- Sub-thought: Examine the momentum in closing prices relative to the highest and lowest within a set timeframe
  - Factor = (Close_t - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1})) / (Max(High_{t-20},...,High_{t-1}) - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1}))
- Sub-thought: Integrate the cumulative effect of the close price over a short period with the daily volume
  - Factor = Sum(Close_{t-4},...,Close_t) * Volume_t
- Sub-thought: Combine the factors to create a composite alpha factor
  - Composite_Factor = w1 * (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t * Volume_t + w2 * (High_t - Max(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})) / Max(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1}) + w3 * (Low_t - Min(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})) / Min(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1}) + w4 * Amount_t / Average(Amount_{t-9},...,Amount_{t-1}) + w5 * (Close_t - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1})) / (Max(High_{t-20},...,High_{t-1}) - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1})) + w6 * Sum(Close_{t-4},...,Close_t) * Volume_t
  - Predicted_Returns = f(Composite_Factor)
