Thought: Calculate the difference between close and open prices to understand daily price movement
    Sub-thought: Calculate the average of (close - open) over the last 5 days to identify a trend in price movements
        Sub-thought: Use the ratio of (close - open) to (high - low) for a single day to capture the relative strength of the close price within the day's range
            Sub-thought: Calculate the average of this ratio over the last 10 days to identify long-term relative strength trends
    Sub-thought: Analyze the pattern of (close - open) over the last 10 days by calculating the number of positive vs. negative days
        Sub-thought: Count the consecutive days where (close - open) is positive or negative to detect momentum
            Sub-thought: Identify the longest streak of consecutive positive or negative (close - open) days in the last 20 days
    Sub-thought: Investigate the relationship between volume and (close - open) by calculating the sum of (close - open) * volume over the last 5 days
        Sub-thought: Determine if there is a consistent increase or decrease in this metric over a period of 10 days
            Sub-thought: Calculate the change in the sum of (close - open) * volume from the last 5 days to the previous 5 days

Thought: Measure the volatility using high and low prices to gauge market uncertainty
    Sub-thought: Compute the standard deviation of (high - low) over the last 20 days as a measure of recent volatility
        Sub-thought: Examine the change in this standard deviation over the last 5 days to identify any shifts in volatility
            Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in the standard deviation of (high - low) from the last 5 days to the previous 5 days
    Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of (high - low) to (close - open) for each day, then average it over the last 10 days to see how the daily range compares to the daily movement
        Sub-thought: Compare the average ratio of (high - low) to (close - open) over the last 10 days to the average ratio over the previous 10 days

Thought: Analyze trading volume to understand market interest
    Sub-thought: Calculate the moving average of volume over the last 30 days to establish a baseline
        Sub-thought: Compare today's volume to this moving average to detect unusual trading activity
            Sub-thought: If today's volume is significantly higher, check if it coincides with a positive or negative (close - open)
                Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in today's volume compared to the 30-day moving average
    Sub-thought: Calculate the cumulative volume over the last 7 days to see if there is a sustained increase or decrease in trading activity
        Sub-thought: Compare the cumulative volume of the last 7 days to the previous 7 days to identify trends
            Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in cumulative volume from the last 7 days to the previous 7 days

Thought: Utilize the amount data to understand the financial flow
    Sub-thought: Calculate the net amount (buying - selling) over the last 10 days to identify the overall buying or selling pressure
        Sub-thought: Compare the net amount with the (close - open) to see if there is a correlation between financial flow and price movement
            Sub-thought: Calculate the average (close - open) on days with positive net amount and compare it to the average (close - open) on days with negative net amount
    Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of amount to volume for each day, then average it over the last 20 days to understand the average transaction size
        Sub-thought: Compare the average transaction size over the last 20 days to the average transaction size over the previous 20 days
