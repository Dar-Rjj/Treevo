Combining Adjusted Momentum and Volume-Adjusted High-Low Range with Weighting
├── Calculate 1-Period Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price for period t (Close_t)
│   └── Use Close price for period t-1 (Close_t-1)
├── Compute Average Price Momentum over 5 Days
│   ├── Use Daily Price Change
│   └── Calculate 5-Day Moving Average
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price (High_t)
│   └── Use Low price (Low_t)
├── Calculate Change in High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High-Low Range of current day (High_t - Low_t)
│   └── Subtract High-Low Range of previous day (High_t-1 - Low_t-1)
├── Combine High-Low Range and Volume
│   ├── Multiply Change in High-Low Range by Volume_t
│   └── Divide by Close_t
├── Introduce Weighting Factors
│   ├── Assign Weight to High-Low Range and Volume Combination (w1)
│   ├── Assign Weight to Price Momentum Component (w2)
├── Combine Weighted Components
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Range and Volume combination by w1
│   ├── Multiply Price Momentum Component by w2
│   └── Sum all weighted components
└── Final Combined Alpha Factor
    ├── Add Volume Adjusted Momentum to Combined Momentum and Volume Adjustment
    ├── Multiply 1-Period Price Momentum by Volume Ratio
    │   ├── Volume Ratio = Volume_t / Average Volume
    ├── Combine Adjusted Momentum, Volume, and Amount
    │   ├── Multiply 1-Period Price Momentum by Volume Ratio
    │   │   ├── Volume Ratio = Volume_t / Average Volume
