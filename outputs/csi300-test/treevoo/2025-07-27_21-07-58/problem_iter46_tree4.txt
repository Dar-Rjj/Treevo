- Calculate daily return
  - Use close price of day t and close price of day t-1
    - DailyReturn = (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
- Create a moving average of daily returns
  - Calculate the sum of daily returns over n days
    - SumOfReturns = SUM(DailyReturn, n)
  - Calculate the moving average
    - MovingAverage = SumOfReturns / n
- Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns
  - Compute the squared difference of each daily return from the moving average
    - SquaredDifference = (DailyReturn - MovingAverage)^2
  - Sum the squared differences over n days
    - SumOfSquaredDifferences = SUM(SquaredDifference, n)
  - Divide by n to get the variance
    - Variance = SumOfSquaredDifferences / n
  - Take the square root to get the standard deviation
    - StandardDeviation = SQRT(Variance)
- Calculate the Sharpe Ratio
  - Divide the moving average of daily returns by the standard deviation
    - SharpeRatio = MovingAverage / StandardDeviation
- Identify significant price levels
  - Determine recent high and low prices
    - RecentHigh = MAX(High, n)
    - RecentLow = MIN(Low, n)
  - Calculate the percentage range
    - PercentageRange = (RecentHigh - RecentLow) / RecentLow
- Calculate the relative strength index (RSI)
  - Separate positive and negative daily returns
    - PositiveReturns = IF(DailyReturn > 0, DailyReturn, 0)
    - NegativeReturns = IF(DailyReturn < 0, -DailyReturn, 0)
  - Calculate the average positive and negative returns over n days
    - AveragePositive = SUM(PositiveReturns, n) / n
    - AverageNegative = SUM(NegativeReturns, n) / n
  - Compute the RSI
    - RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (AveragePositive / AverageNegative)))
- Combine factors into a composite alpha factor
  - Multiply the Sharpe Ratio by the RSI
    - CompositeAlphaFactor = SharpeRatio * RSI
  - Adjust for price levels
    - FinalAlphaFactor = CompositeAlphaFactor * PercentageRange
