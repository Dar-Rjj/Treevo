Synthesize the relationship between trading volume, price changes, and pricing patterns to predict future stock returns
├── Use the difference between close and open price divided by the opening price, weighted by the daily volume
│   └── Factor1 = (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t * Volume_t
├── Calculate the trend in highs over a specific period
│   └── Factor2 = (High_t - Max(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})) / Max(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})
├── Calculate the trend in lows over a specific period
│   └── Factor3 = (Low_t - Min(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})) / Min(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})
├── Compute the ratio of the current day's traded amount to the moving average of the amount over past days
│   └── Factor4 = Amount_t / Average(Amount_{t-9},...,Amount_{t-1})
├── Determine the stock's closing position relative to its recent high and low
│   └── Factor5 = (Close_t - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1})) / (Max(High_{t-20},...,High_{t-1}) - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1}))
├── Calculate 1-Period Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price for period t (Close_t)
│   └── Use Close price for period t-1 (Close_t-1)
│   └── Factor6 = (Close_t - Close_t-1) / Close_t-1
├── Compute 5-Day Moving Average of Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Daily Price Change Percentage
│   └── Factor7 = Average(Factor6_{t-4},...,Factor6_{t-1})
├── Compute 10-Day Moving Average Volume Change
│   ├── Use Daily Volume Change
│   └── Factor8 = Average((Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}) / Volume_{t-1}_{t-9},...,t-1)
├── Combine Price Momentum and Volume Surge
│   ├── Multiply 5-Day Moving Average Price Momentum by 10-Day Moving Average Volume Change
│   └── Factor9 = Factor7 * Factor8
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│   └── Factor10 = High_t - Low_t
├── Calculate Change in High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High-Low Range of current day
│   └── Subtract High-Low Range of previous day
│   └── Factor11 = Factor10 - (High_t-1 - Low_t-1)
├── Combine High-Low Range and Volume
│   ├── Multiply Change in High-Low Range by Volume
│   └── Divide by Close price
