Performing alpha mining to generate novel and interpretable factors
|-- Considering raw price information
|   |-- Calculate return from close prices
|   |   |-- Simple daily return: (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
|   |   `-- Cumulative 5-day return: (close_t - close_t-5) / close_t-5
|   `-- Analyzing high and low prices for volatility
|       |-- Daily range: (high_t - low_t)
|       `-- Average true range over 14 days (without normalization)
`-- Exploring volume and amount data
    |-- Change in daily trading volume: (volume_t - volume_t-1)
    `-- Volume weighted by price movement: (close_t - open_t) * volume_t
    `-- Price momentum with volume: (close_t - open_t) * (volume_t / volume_t-1)
