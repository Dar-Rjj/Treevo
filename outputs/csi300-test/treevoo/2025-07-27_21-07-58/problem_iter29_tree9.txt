Generate novel alpha factors for predicting future stock returns with Synthesized High-Low Range and Price-Volume Momentum
|
|-- Calculate Price Momentum Factors
|   |
|   |-- 1. Short-Term Price Momentum: (close_t / close_(t-5)) - 1
|   |
|   `-- 2. Medium-Term Price Momentum: (close_t / close_(t-20)) - 1
|
|-- Identify Volume-Weighted Price Actions
|   |
|   |-- 3. Weighted Average of High and Low Prices: (high_t + low_t)/2 * volume_t
|   |   |
|   |   `-- 4. 5-Day Moving Average of Weighted Avg. H/L
|   |
|   `-- 5. Cumulative Volume-Adjusted Return: Sum[(close_i - open_i) * volume_i, i = t-9 to t]
|
|-- Analyze Trading Volume Patterns
|   |
|   |-- 6. Ratio of Today's Volume to 5-Day Average Volume: volume_t / Avg(volume_(t-4) to volume_(t))
|   |
|   `-- 7. Trend in Volume: (volume_t - volume_(t-5)) / 5
|
|-- Evaluate Volatility and Range
|   |
|   |-- 8. Daily Price Range: high_t - low_t
|   |
|   |-- 9. 5-Day Moving Average of Daily Price Range
|   |
|   |-- 10. Relative Daily Range: (high_t - low_t) / close_(t-1)
|   |
|   `-- 11. Standard Deviation of Close Prices over 20 Days
|
|-- Calculate Daily Price Change
|   |
|   `-- Use Close price: close_t - close_(t-1)
|
|-- Compute Average Price Momentum over 5 Days
|   |
|   `-- Use Daily Price Change: 5-Day Moving Average of (close_t - close_(t-1))
|
|-- Calculate Daily Volume Change
|   |
|   `-- Use Volume: volume_t - volume_(t-1)
|
|-- Compute Average Volume Change over 10 Days
|   |
|   `-- Use Daily Volume Change: 10-Day Moving Average of (volume_t - volume_(t-1))
|
|-- Combine Price Momentum and Volume Surge
|   |
|   `-- Multiply Price Momentum Component by Volume Surge Component: (5-Day Price Momentum * 10-Day Volume Change)
|
|-- Calculate Daily Return
|   |
|   `-- Use Close price: close_t - open_t
|
|-- Compute Moving Sum of Positive Returns
|   |
|   `-- Filter positive daily returns and apply 21-day moving sum
|
|-- Volume Adjusted Momentum
|   |
|   |-- Calculate Cumulative Volume: 21-day cumulative sum of volume
|   |
|   |-- Multiply Moving Sum of Positive Returns by Cumulative Volume
|   |
|   `-- Divide by Total Days: Ensure no division by zero
|
|-- Compute High-Low Range
|   |
|   `-- Use High price: high_t - low_t
|
|-- Calculate Change in High-Low Range
|   |
|   `-- Use High-Low Range of current day: (high_t - low_t) - (high_(t-1) - low_(t-1))
|
|-- Calculate Volume Surge Component
|   |
|   `-- 5-Day Moving Average of Volume Change Percentage: 5-Day Moving Average of (volume_t - volume_(t-1)) / volume_(t-1)
|
|-- Combine High-Low Range and Volume
|   |
|   `-- Multiply Change in High-Low Range by Volume: (high_t - low_t - (high_(t-1) - low_(t-1))) * volume_t
|   |
|   `-- Divide by Close price: (Change in High-Low Range * Volume) / close_t
|
|-- Adjust by Average Volume
|   |
|   |-- Calculate Average Volume over n periods: Sum(volume_t to volume_(t-n+1)) / n
|   |
|   `-- Compare with Recent Volume: volume_t / Average Volume
|
|-- Adjust by Average Amount
|   |
|   |-- Calculate Average Amount over m periods: Sum(amount_t to amount_(t-m+1)) / m
|   |
|   `-- Compare with Recent Amount: amount_t / Average Amount
|
|-- Introduce Weighting Factors
|   |
|   |-- Assign Weight to High-Low Range and Volume Combination (w1)
|   |
|   |-- Assign Weight to Price Momentum Component (w2)
|   |
|   |-- Assign Weight to Volume Surge Component (w3)
|   |
|   |-- Assign Weight to Volume Ratio (
