- Calculate daily price change factors
  - Use close price to calculate daily return: (close_t / close_t-1) - 1
  - Calculate log returns: log(close_t / close_t-1)
- Derive momentum indicators from daily returns
  - Create a simple moving average (SMA) of daily returns over N days
  - Compute the difference between the current close price and SMA: close_t - SMA_N
- Generate volatility measures
  - Measure standard deviation of daily returns over a rolling window of M days
- Explore volume trends
  - Calculate the percentage change in trading volume: (volume_t / volume_t-1) - 1
- Incorporate high and low prices
  - Compute the range for each day: high_t - low_t
  - Calculate the true range: max(high_t - low_t, abs(high_t - close_t-1), abs(low_t - close_t-1))
- Analyze gaps
  - Detect gap up or down: (open_t - close_t-1) > threshold
- Examine trading activity
  - Evaluate the ratio of closing price to open price: close_t / open_t
- Consider amount traded
  - Calculate the average amount traded per share: amount_t / volume_t
- Combine multiple indicators
  - Construct a composite score by summing standardized values of selected indicators
- Investigate price patterns
  - Identify specific candlestick patterns (e.g., doji, hammer) based on open, high, low, and close
- Assess market sentiment
  - Use the ratio of close to open price as a proxy for intraday sentiment: close_t / open_t
- Generate trend-following signals
  - Apply a simple moving average crossover strategy: SMA_short_term - SMA_long_term
- Analyze relative strength
  - Compare the stock's performance to a benchmark: (stock_return_t - benchmark_return_t)
- Utilize open interest data (if available)
  - Compute the ratio of volume to open interest: volume_t / open_interest_t
- Examine liquidity
  - Calculate the liquidity ratio: (high_t - low_t) / (2 * volume_t)
- Incorporate technical indicators
  - Implement relative strength index (RSI) using daily returns
- Consider market breadth
  - Analyze the number of advancing vs. declining issues (if available)
- Look at accumulation/distribution line
  - Calculate the cumulative flow into and out of the stock using volume and close price
- Explore price-weighted averages
  - Develop a custom price-weighted index using a subset of stocks
- Use machine learning techniques
  - Train a simple model on historical data to predict future returns (e.g., linear regression)
- Evaluate seasonal patterns
  - Identify recurring patterns in returns over specific time periods (e.g., monthly, yearly)
- Assess mean reversion
  - Use Bollinger Bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions
- Examine market capitalization
  - Calculate the market cap: close_t * shares_outstanding
- Consider sector-specific factors
  - Incorporate industry-specific metrics or ratios (if available)
- Analyze dividend yield
  - Calculate the dividend yield: annual_dividend / close_t
- Incorporate earnings announcements
  - Flag days with significant changes following earnings announcements
- Use news sentiment
  - Integrate sentiment scores from news articles (if available)
- Examine insider trading
  - Incorporate data on insider buying and selling (if available)
- Consider macroeconomic factors
  - Include relevant macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, inflation rates)
- Use options data (if available)
  - Integrate implied volatility from options
- Incorporate bond yields
  - Use the 10-year Treasury yield as a risk-free rate proxy
- Analyze economic cycles
  - Incorporate leading economic indicators (e.g., PMI, housing starts)
- Use machine learning for feature selection
  - Apply feature importance techniques to select the most relevant alpha factors
- Consider market anomalies
  - Explore known market anomalies (e.g., size effect, value effect)
- Examine market efficiency
  - Incorporate measures of market efficiency (e.g., bid-ask spread, turnover ratio)
- Use alternative data sources
  - Integrate data from non-traditional sources (e.g., satellite imagery, web traffic)
- Implement backtesting
  - Test the performance of the generated alpha factors using historical data
- Optimize factor weights
  - Use optimization techniques to find the best combination of alpha factors
- Consider portfolio constraints
  - Incorporate constraints such as turnover, leverage, and sector limits
- Monitor and rebalance
  - Set up a process for monitoring and rebalancing the portfolio
- Evaluate risk-adjusted returns
  - Use metrics like Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio to evaluate performance
- Consider transaction costs
