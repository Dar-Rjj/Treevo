Price Momentum with Volume and Amount Adjustment
├── Calculate 1-Period Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price for period t (Close_t)
│   └── Use Close price for period t-1 (Close_t-1)
├── Adjust by Average Volume and Amount
│   ├── Calculate Average Volume over n periods
│   │   ├── Aggregate Volumes from period t to t-n+1
│   │   └── Divide by n
│   ├── Calculate Average Amount over m periods
│   │   ├── Aggregate Amounts from period t to t-m+1
│   │   └── Divide by m
│   └── Compare with Recent Volume and Amount
│       ├── Use Volume for period t (Volume_t)
│       ├── Use Amount for period t (Amount_t)
│       ├── Use Average Volume
│       └── Use Average Amount
└── Combine Momentum, Volume, and Amount Adjustment
    ├── Calculate Volume and Amount Ratio
    │   ├── Volume Ratio = Volume_t / Average Volume
    │   └── Amount Ratio = Amount_t / Average Amount
    ├── Multiply 1-Period Price Momentum by Combined Ratios
    │   ├── Combined Ratio = Volume Ratio * Amount Ratio
    └── Interpretable as Adjusted Momentum Factor
