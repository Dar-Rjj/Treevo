├── Investigate Intraday Momentum
│   ├── Calculate the intraday momentum as (Close[t] - Open[t])
├── Analyze Price Gaps
│   ├── Calculate the average gap over the last 5 days
├── Compute 1-Period Price Momentum

├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Calculate Change in High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High-Low Range of current day
│   └── Subtract High-Low Range of previous day
├── Combine High-Low Range and Volume
│   ├── Multiply Change in High-Low Range by Volume
│   └── Divide by Close price

├── Examine the Trend in Highs and Lows
│   ├── Calculate the trend in highs over a specific period
│   │   └── Factor = (High[t] - Max(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})) / Max(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})
│   ├── Calculate the trend in lows over a specific period
│   │   └── Factor = (Low[t] - Min(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})) / Min(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})
├── Evaluate the Influence of the Average Amount Transacted
│   ├── Compute the ratio of the current day's traded amount to the moving average of the amount over past days
│   │   └── Factor = Amount[t] / Average(Amount_{t-9},...,Amount_{t-1})
