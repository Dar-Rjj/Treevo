Generate novel and improved alpha factors for predicting future stock returns
|
|-- Calculate Price Momentum Factors
|   |
|   |-- 1. Short-Term Price Momentum: (close_t / close_(t-5)) - 1
|   `-- 2. Medium-Term Price Momentum: (close_t / close_(t-20)) - 1
|
|-- Identify Volume-Weighted Price Actions
|   |
|   |-- 3. Weighted Average of High and Low Prices: (high_t + low_t)/2 * volume_t
|   |   `-- 4. 5-Day Moving Average of Weighted Avg. H/L
|   `-- 5. Cumulative Volume-Adjusted Return: Sum[(close_i - open_i) * volume_i, i = t-9 to t]
|
|-- Analyze Trading Volume Patterns
|   |
|   `-- 6. Ratio of Today's Volume to 5-Day Average Volume: volume_t / Avg(volume_(t-4) to volume_(t))
|
|-- Evaluate Volatility and Range
|   |
|   |-- 8. Daily Price Range: high_t - low_t
|   `-- 11. Standard Deviation of Close Prices over 20 Days
|
|-- Incorporate Additional Price and Volume Dynamics
|   |
|   `-- 10. Relative Daily Range: (high_t - low_t) / close_(t-1)
|
|-- Synthesize the relationship between trading volume, price changes, and pricing patterns
|   |
|   |-- 12. Impact of Daily Trading Volume on Stock Prices: (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t * Volume_t
|   |-- 13. Trend in Highs Over a Specific Period: (High_t - Average(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})) / Average(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})
|   |-- 14. Trend in Lows Over a Specific Period: (Low_t - Average(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})) / Average(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})
|   |-- 15. Influence of the Average Amount Transacted: Amount_t / Average(Amount_{t-9},...,Amount_{t-1})
|   |-- 16. Momentum in Closing Prices Relative to Recent High and Low: (Close_t - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1})) / (Max(High_{t-20},...,High_{t-1}) - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1}))
|   `-- 17. Composite Alpha Factor: w1 * 12 + w2 * 13 + w3 * 14 + w4 * 15 + w5 * 16
|
`-- Predict Future Stock Returns Using Composite Factor
    |
    `-- 18. Predicted_Returns = f(Composite_Factor)
