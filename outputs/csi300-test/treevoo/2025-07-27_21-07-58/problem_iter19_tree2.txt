Crossover of Momentum, Volatility, and Volume-Based Alpha Factor with High-Low Range and Price-Volume Momentum Adjustments
├── Calculate Momentum Indicator
│   ├── Compute 5-day Sum of Daily Returns (Close_t / Close_{t-1} - 1)
│   └── Subtract 5-day Simple Moving Average of Close Price
├── Calculate Average True Range
│   ├── Determine True Range (Max[High - Low, Abs(High - Close_{t-1}), Abs(Low - Close_{t-1})])
│   └── Compute 14-day Simple Moving Average of True Range
├── Combine Momentum and Volatility
│   └── Weighted Momentum * Inverse of Average True Range
│       ├── Weighted Momentum = 5-day Sum of Daily Returns * 0.7
└── Adjust by Volume and Amount
    ├── Calculate Volume Ratio (Volume_t / Average Volume)
    │   └── Average Volume over n periods
    ├── Calculate Amount Ratio (Amount_t / Average Amount)
    │   └── Average Amount over m periods
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        └── (Weighted Momentum * Volume Ratio * Amount Ratio) + 
            (Price Oscillator + Adjusted High-Low Range and Volume Combination)
        ├── Price Oscillator = 12-day EMA(Close) - 26-day EMA(Close)
        └── Adjusted High-Low Range and Volume Combination
            ├── Change in High-Low Range * Volume / Close Price
            │   ├── Change in High-Low Range = (High_t - Low_t) - (High_{t-1} - Low_{t-1})
            └── Add Trend Following Multiplier if Close > 50-day SMA
