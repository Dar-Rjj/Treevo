High-Low Range and Price-Volume Momentum with Adjustments and Weighted Components
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Calculate Change in High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High-Low Range of current day
│   └── Subtract High-Low Range of previous day
├── Calculate Price Momentum Component
│   ├── Compute Daily Price Change Percentage
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close Price
├── Calculate Volume Surge Component
│   ├── Compute Daily Volume Change Percentage
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Day's Volume
├── Combine High-Low Range and Volume
│   ├── Multiply Change in High-Low Range by Volume
│   └── Divide by Close price
├── Compare with Recent Volume
│   ├── Use Volume for period t (Volume_t)
│   └── Compare with Average Volume over n periods
├── Compare with Recent Amount
│   ├── Use Amount for period t (Amount_t)
│   └── Compare with Average Amount over m periods
├── Introduce Weighting Factors
│   ├── Assign Weight to High-Low Range and Volume combination (w1)
│   ├── Assign Weight to Price Momentum Component (w2)
│   ├── Assign Weight to Volume Surge Component (w3)
│   ├── Assign Weight to Volume Ratio (w4)
│   └── Assign Weight to Amount Ratio (w5)
├── Combine Weighted Components
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Range and Volume combination by w1
│   ├── Multiply Price Momentum Component by w2
│   ├── Multiply Volume Surge Component by w3
│   ├── Multiply Volume Ratio by w4
│   ├── Multiply Amount Ratio by w5
│   └── Sum all weighted components
└── Output as Alpha Factor
