├── Calculate Change in High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High-Low Range of current day
│   └── Subtract High-Low Range of previous day
├── Calculate Price Momentum Component
│   ├── Compute Daily Price Change Percentage
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close Price
├── Calculate Volume Surge Component
│   ├── Compute Daily Volume Change Percentage
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Day's Volume
├── Combine High-Low Range and Volume
│   ├── Multiply Change in High-Low Range by Volume
│   └── Divide by Close price
├── Adjust by Average Volume
