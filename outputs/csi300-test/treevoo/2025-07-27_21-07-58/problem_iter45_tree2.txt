Thought: Synthesize the relationship between trading volume, price changes, and pricing patterns to predict future stock returns
- Sub-thought: Use the difference between close and open price divided by the opening price, weighted by the daily volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor1 = (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t * Volume_t
- Sub-thought: Calculate the trend in highs over a specific period
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor2 = (High_t - Average(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})) / Average(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})
- Sub-thought: Calculate the trend in lows over a specific period
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor3 = (Low_t - Average(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})) / Average(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})
- Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of the current day's traded amount to the moving average of the amount over past days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor4 = Amount_t / Average(Amount_{t-10},...,Amount_{t-1})
- Sub-thought: Determine the stock's closing position relative to its recent high and low
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor5 = (Close_t - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1})) / (Max(High_{t-20},...,High_{t-1}) - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1}))
- Sub-thought: Introduce a factor that measures the volatility of the stock using the standard deviation of the closing prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor6 = StdDev(Close_{t-20},...,Close_{t-1})
- Sub-thought: Combine the factors to create a composite alpha factor
  - Sub-sub-thought: Composite_Factor = w1 * Factor1 + w2 * Factor2 + w3 * Factor3 + w4 * Factor4 + w5 * Factor5 + w6 * Factor6
  - Sub-sub-thought: Predicted_Returns = f(Composite_Factor)
