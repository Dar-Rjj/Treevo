Thought: Explore trend and momentum indicators based on price and volume data
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate simple moving averages (SMA) for different time windows
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between short-term and long-term SMA to identify crossover signals
  - Sub-Thought: Identify price momentum using rate of change (ROC) over different periods
    - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the strength of momentum by comparing the ROC against a threshold
  - Sub-Thought: Assess volume trends by calculating the ratio of current volume to the average volume over a period
    - Sub-Thought: Use this ratio to identify days with unusually high or low trading activity
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze the relative strength index (RSI) to gauge overbought or oversold conditions
    - Sub-Thought: Determine if the RSI is above or below key levels (e.g., 70 or 30)
  - Sub-Thought: Examine the relationship between open, high, low, and close prices
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily range (high - low) and compare it to historical ranges
    - Sub-Thought: Investigate the direction of the market by analyzing the close price relative to the open price
  - Sub-Thought: Develop a composite factor by combining multiple indicators
    - Sub-Thought: Sum or average the normalized (but not actually normalizing) values of selected indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Consider the amount traded in relation to price changes
    - Sub-Thought: Measure the ratio of the amount traded to the price movement
    - Sub-Thought: Use this ratio to infer the significance of price movements
  - Sub-Thought: Incorporate the accumulation/distribution line (ADL) to assess buying and selling pressure
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ADL by summing the money flow multiplier and the period's volume
    - Sub-Thought: Analyze the slope of the ADL to indicate buying or selling pressure
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the volatility of the stock using the standard deviation of returns
    - Sub-Thought: Use the standard deviation to create bands around the moving average
  - Sub-Thought: Create a custom indicator by combining high, low, and close prices
    - Sub-Thought: Develop a formula that incorporates these prices to generate a new factor
