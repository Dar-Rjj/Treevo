Thought: Synthesize the relationship between trading volume, price changes, pricing patterns, and momentum to predict future stock returns

- Sub-thought: Use the difference between close and open price divided by the opening price, weighted by the daily volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor1 = (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t * Volume_t

- Sub-thought: Calculate the trend in highs over a specific period
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor2 = (High_t - Max(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})) / Max(High_{t-5},...,High_{t-1})

- Sub-thought: Calculate the trend in lows over a specific period
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor3 = (Low_t - Min(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})) / Min(Low_{t-5},...,Low_{t-1})

- Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of the current day's traded amount to the moving average of the amount over past days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor4 = Amount_t / Average(Amount_{t-9},...,Amount_{t-1})

- Sub-thought: Determine the stock's closing position relative to its recent high and low
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor5 = (Close_t - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1})) / (Max(High_{t-20},...,High_{t-1}) - Min(Low_{t-20},...,Low_{t-1}))

- Sub-thought: Calculate Short-Term and Medium-Term Price Momentum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor6 = (Close_t / Close_(t-5)) - 1
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor7 = (Close_t / Close_(t-20)) - 1

- Sub-thought: Compute Average Price Momentum over 5 Days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Daily_Price_Change = Close_t - Close_(t-1)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor8 = 5-Day Moving Average of Daily_Price_Change

- Sub-thought: Identify Volume-Weighted Price Actions
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor9 = (High_t + Low_t) / 2 * Volume_t
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor10 = 5-Day Moving Average of Factor9
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor11 = Sum[(Close_i - Open_i) * Volume_i, i = t-9 to t]

- Sub-thought: Analyze Trading Volume Patterns
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor12 = Volume_t / Average(Volume_{t-4} to Volume_{t})
  - Sub-sub-thought: Daily_Volume_Change = Volume_t - Volume_(t-1)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor13 = 10-Day Moving Average of Daily_Volume_Change

- Sub-thought: Evaluate Volatility and Range
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor14 = High_t - Low_t
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor15 = (High_t - Low_t) / Close_(t-1)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor16 = Standard Deviation of Close Prices over 22 Days

- Sub-thought: Combine Price Momentum and Volume Surge
  - Sub-sub-thought: Factor17 = Factor8 * Factor13

- Sub-thought: Introduce Weighting Factors
  - Sub-sub-thought: Assign weights w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17

- Sub-thought: Combine Weighted Components
  - Sub-sub-thought: Combined_Factor = w1 * Factor1 + w2 * Factor2 + w3 * Factor3 + w4 * Factor4 + w5 * Factor5 + w6 * Factor6 + w7 * Factor7 + w8 * Factor8 + w9 * Factor9 + w10 * Factor10 + w11 * Factor11 + w12 * Factor12 + w13 * Factor13 + w14 * Factor14 + w15 * Factor15 + w16 * Factor16 + w17 * Factor17

- Sub-thought: Final Combined Alpha Factor
  - Sub-sub-thought: Predicted_Returns = f(Combined_Factor)
