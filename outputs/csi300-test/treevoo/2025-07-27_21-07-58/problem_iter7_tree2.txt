Price Momentum Adjusted by Volume and Amount
├── Calculate 1-Period Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price for period t (Close_t)
│   └── Use Close price for period t-1 (Close_t-1)
├── Calculate Average Volume over n periods
│   ├── Aggregate Volumes from period t to t-n+1
│   └── Divide by n
├── Calculate Average Amount over n periods
│   ├── Aggregate Amounts from period t to t-n+1
│   └── Divide by n
├── Compute Volume Ratio
│   ├── Volume Ratio = Volume_t / Average Volume
├── Compute Amount Ratio
│   ├── Amount Ratio = Amount_t / Average Amount
└── Combine Momentum, Volume, and Amount Ratios
    ├── Multiply 1-Period Price Momentum by Volume Ratio
    ├── Multiply Result by Amount Ratio
    └── Interpretable as Adjusted Momentum Factor
