Performing alpha mining to generate novel and interpretable factors for predicting future stock returns
|-- Exploring price patterns
|   |-- Price trend analysis
|   |   |-- Calculate the moving average (MA) of closing prices over 5, 10, and 20 days
|   |   |-- Compute the difference between the current close and the MAs
|   |   |   |-- Close - MA(5)
|   |   |   |-- Close - MA(10)
|   |   |   |-- Close - MA(20)
|   |   |-- Determine the trend by comparing the differences
|   |-- Price momentum
|   |   |-- Calculate the rate of change (ROC) of closing prices over 5, 10, and 20 days
|   |   |-- Compute the ROC as (Close - Close[n periods ago]) / Close[n periods ago]
|   |   |   |-- ROC(5) = (Close - Close[5]) / Close[5]
|   |   |   |-- ROC(10) = (Close - Close[10]) / Close[10]
|   |   |   |-- ROC(20) = (Close - Close[20]) / Close[20]
|   |   |-- Determine the momentum strength by comparing ROCs
|-- Analyzing volume and amount
|   |-- Volume trend analysis
|   |   |-- Calculate the moving average (MA) of volume over 5, 10, and 20 days
|   |   |-- Compute the difference between the current volume and the MAs
|   |   |   |-- Volume - MA(5)
|   |   |   |-- Volume - MA(10)
|   |   |   |-- Volume - MA(20)
|   |   |-- Determine the volume trend by comparing the differences
|   |-- Amount trend analysis
|   |   |-- Calculate the moving average (MA) of amount over 5, 10, and 20 days
|   |   |-- Compute the difference between the current amount and the MAs
|   |   |   |-- Amount - MA(5)
|   |   |   |-- Amount - MA(10)
|   |   |   |-- Amount - MA(20)
|   |   |-- Determine the amount trend by comparing the differences
|-- Identifying support and resistance levels
|   |-- Identify local highs and lows
|   |   |-- Find peaks and troughs in the high and low prices
|   |   |-- Use these points to identify potential support and resistance levels
|   |-- Evaluate the proximity of the current price to these levels
|       |-- Calculate the distance from the current close to the nearest support and resistance
|       |   |-- Distance to support = Close - Nearest support
|       |   |-- Distance to resistance = Nearest resistance - Close
|-- Combining factors into a composite indicator
    |-- Create a weighted sum of the individual factors
    |   |-- Weighted sum = w1 * (Close - MA(Close, 20)) + w2 * ROC(Close, 20) + w3 * (Volume - MA(Volume, 20)) + w4 * (Amount - MA(Amount, 20))
    |   |-- Weights (w1, w2, w3, w4) are determined based on historical performance
    |-- Use the composite indicator to predict future stock returns
