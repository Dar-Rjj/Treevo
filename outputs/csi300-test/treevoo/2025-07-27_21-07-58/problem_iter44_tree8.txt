Thought: Explore Price Patterns
- Sub-thought: Analyze Trends in Closing Prices
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the closing price and the average closing price over the last N days
    - Sub-thought: Define a factor as the sign of the difference (positive or negative)
  - Sub-thought: Identify the direction of the trend using a simple moving average crossover
    - Sub-thought: Use short-term (e.g., 5-day) and long-term (e.g., 20-day) moving averages
    - Sub-thought: Define a factor as 1 if the short-term moving average is above the long-term, -1 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Examine Intraday Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the range between the high and low prices
    - Sub-thought: Define a factor as the ratio of today's range to the average range over the last N days
  - Sub-thought: Analyze the intraday momentum
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change from the open to the close
    - Sub-thought: Define a factor as the sign of the percentage change (positive or negative)
- Sub-thought: Investigate Volume Patterns
  - Sub-thought: Compare today's volume to the average volume over the last N days
    - Sub-thought: Define a factor as the ratio of today's volume to the average volume
  - Sub-thought: Analyze volume spikes
    - Sub-thought: Identify days with volume significantly higher than the average
    - Sub-thought: Define a factor as 1 if the volume is above a certain threshold, 0 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Integrate Multiple Factors
  - Sub-thought: Combine the factors from trends, volatility, and volume
    - Sub-thought: Use a weighted sum of the individual factors
    - Sub-thought: Define a final alpha factor as the weighted sum
