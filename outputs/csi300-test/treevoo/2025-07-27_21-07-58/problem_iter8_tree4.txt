High-Low Range and Price-Volume Momentum with Enhanced Adjustments
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price (High_t)
│   └── Use Low price (Low_t)
├── Calculate Change in High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High-Low Range of current day (Range_t)
│   └── Subtract High-Low Range of previous day (Range_t-1)
├── Calculate 1-Period Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price for period t (Close_t)
│   └── Use Close price for period t-1 (Close_t-1)
├── Calculate Volume Surge Component
│   ├── Compute Daily Volume Change Percentage
│   │   ├── Use Volume (Volume_t)
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Day's Volume (Volume_t-1)
├── Combine High-Low Range and Volume
│   ├── Multiply Change in High-Low Range by Volume (ΔRange * Volume_t)
│   └── Divide by Close price (ΔRange * Volume_t / Close_t)
├── Calculate Average Volume over n periods
│   ├── Aggregate Volumes from period t to t-n+1
│   └── Divide by n
├── Compare Recent Volume with Average Volume
│   ├── Use Volume for period t (Volume_t)
│   └── Use Average Volume
├── Calculate Average Amount over m periods
│   ├── Aggregate Amounts from period t to t-m+1
│   └── Divide by m
├── Compare Recent Amount with Average Amount
│   ├── Use Amount for period t (Amount_t)
│   └── Use Average Amount
├── Compute Volume Ratio
│   ├── Volume Ratio = Volume_t / Average Volume
├── Compute Amount Ratio
│   ├── Amount Ratio = Amount_t / Average Amount
├── Combine Components
│   ├── Multiply 1-Period Price Momentum by Volume Surge Component
│   ├── Add the result to the High-Low Range and Volume combination
│   ├── Multiply 1-Period Price Momentum by Volume Ratio
│   ├── Multiply Result by Amount Ratio
└── Output as Alpha Factor
