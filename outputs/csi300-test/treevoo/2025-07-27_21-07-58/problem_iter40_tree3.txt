Thought: Calculate the difference between the closing price and the opening price as a simple measure of daily momentum.
    Sub-Thought: Utilize the absolute value of the high-low range to capture volatility.
        Sub-Thought: Combine the daily momentum and volatility into a single factor by dividing the momentum by the day's volatility, suggesting a risk-adjusted return.
Thought: Compute the weighted average of close prices over the past N days, with weights inversely proportional to their age, to capture a smooth trend.
    Sub-Thought: Subtract the current day's close price from this weighted average to identify deviations from the recent trend.
Thought: Measure the change in volume over the past M days as a proxy for liquidity and market interest.
    Sub-Thought: Correlate this volume change with the return (close price of today / close price of yesterday - 1) to infer if increasing volume is associated with positive or negative returns, hinting at market sentiment.
Thought: Look at the ratio of the amount traded to the volume to get an idea of the average price at which trades were executed, providing insight into whether the stock was bought or sold at relatively higher or lower prices during the day.
    Sub-Thought: Observe the trend of this ratio over the past K days to see if there is a pattern indicating accumulation or distribution phases.
