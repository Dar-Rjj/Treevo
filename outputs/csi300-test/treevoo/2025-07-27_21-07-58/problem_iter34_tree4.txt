|-- Calculate Price Momentum Factors
|   |
|   |-- 1. Short-Term Price Momentum: (close_t / close_(t-5)) - 1
|   `-- 2. Medium-Term Price Momentum: (close_t / close_(t-20)) - 1
|
|-- Identify Volume-Weighted Price Actions
|   |
|   |-- 3. Weighted Average of High and Low Prices: (high_t + low_t)/2 * volume_t
|   |   `-- 4. 5-Day Moving Average of Weighted Avg. H/L
|   `-- 5. Cumulative Volume-Adjusted Return: Sum[(close_i - open_i) * volume_i, i = t-9 to t]
|
|-- Analyze Trading Volume Patterns
|   |
|   |-- 6. Ratio of Today's Volume to 5-Day Average Volume: volume_t / Avg(volume_(t-4) to volume_(t))
|   `-- 7. Trend in Volume: (volume_t - volume_(t-5)) / 5
|
|-- Evaluate Volatility and Range
|   |
|   |-- 8. Daily Price Range: high_t - low_t
|   `-- 9. 5-Day Moving Average of Daily Price Range
|
`-- Incorporate Additional Price and Volume Dynamics
    |
    |-- 10. Relative Daily Range: (high_t - low_t) / close_(t-1)
    `-- 11. Standard Deviation of Close Prices over 20 Days
    |
    |-- 12. Volume-Weighted Close Price: close_t * volume_t
    |   `-- 13. 5-Day Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close Price
    `-- 14. Price Change with Volume Influence: (close_t - close_(t-1)) * (volume_t / Avg(volume_(t-4) to volume_(t)))
