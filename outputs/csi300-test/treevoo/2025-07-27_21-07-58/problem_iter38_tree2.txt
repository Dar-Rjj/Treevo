Thought 1: Start with basic price patterns
    Thought 1.1: Calculate the daily return based on Close-to-Close
        Thought 1.1.1: Compute the daily return as (Close[t] - Close[t-1]) / Close[t-1]
    Thought 1.2: Calculate the daily return based on Open-to-Close
        Thought 1.2.1: Compute the daily return as (Close[t] - Open[t]) / Open[t]
Thought 2: Explore relationships between price and volume
    Thought 2.1: Calculate the volume-to-price ratio as (Volume[t] / Close[t])
Thought 3: Investigate intraday momentum
    Thought 3.1: Calculate the intraday momentum as (Close[t] - Open[t])
Thought 4: Analyze price gaps
    Thought 4.1: Calculate the gap between today's Open and yesterday's Close
        Thought 4.1.1: Compute the gap as (Open[t] - Close[t-1])
Thought 5: Combine factors for a more comprehensive view
    Thought 5.1: Create a composite factor using a weighted sum of the above factors

        Thought 5.1.2: Sum the weighted factors to create a single composite factor
Thought 6: Introduce new factors based on trading behavior
    Thought 6.1: Calculate the moving average convergence divergence (MACD)
        Thought 6.1.1: Compute the MACD line as the 12-day EMA minus the 26-day EMA
        Thought 6.1.2: Compute the signal line as the 9-day EMA of the MACD line
        Thought 6.1.3: Compute the MACD histogram as the difference between the MACD line and the signal line
