Improved Synthesized Price-Volume and High-Low Momentum Factor
├── Calculate 1-Period Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price for period t (Close_t)
│   └── Use Close price for period t-1 (Close_t-1)
├── Compute Daily Price Change Percentage
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close Price
├── Compute Average Price Momentum over 5 Days
│   ├── Use Daily Price Change Percentage
│   └── Calculate 5-Day Moving Average
├── Calculate Daily Volume Change
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Volume
├── Compute Average Volume Change over 10 Days
│   ├── Use Daily Volume Change
│   └── Calculate 10-Day Moving Average
├── Combine Price Momentum and Volume Surge
│   ├── Multiply 5-Day Moving Average Price Momentum by 10-Day Moving Average Volume Change
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Calculate Change in High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High-Low Range of current day
│   └── Subtract High-Low Range of previous day
├── Combine High-Low Range and Volume
│   ├── Multiply Change in High-Low Range by Volume
│   └── Divide by Close price
├── Adjust by Average Volume
│   ├── Calculate Average Volume over n periods
│   │   ├── Aggregate Volumes from period t to t-n+1

│   └── Compare with Recent Volume
│       ├── Use Volume for period t (Volume_t)
│       └── Use Average Volume
├── Adjust by Average Amount
│   ├── Calculate Average Amount over m periods
│   │   ├── Aggregate Amounts from period t to t-m+1
│   │   └── Divide by m
│   └── Compare with Recent Amount
│       ├── Use Amount for period t (Amount_t)
│       └── Use Average Amount
├── Combine Adjusted Momentum, Volume, and Amount
│   ├── Multiply 1-Period Price Momentum by Volume Ratio
│   │   ├── Volume Ratio = Volume_t / Average Volume
│   ├── Multiply Result by Amount Ratio
│   │   ├── Amount Ratio = Amount_t / Average Amount
│   └── Add Combined Price Momentum and Volume Surge
├── Incorporate High-Low Range Dynamics
│   ├── Calculate 5-Day Moving Average of High-Low Range
│   │   ├── Use High-Low Range
