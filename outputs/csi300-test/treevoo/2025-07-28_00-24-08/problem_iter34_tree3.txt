- Calculate price-based features
  - Compute daily return: (close_t - close_(t-1)) / close_(t-1)
  - Compute high-low range: high_t - low_t
  - Compute upper shadow: high_t - max(open_t, close_t)
  - Compute lower shadow: min(open_t, close_t) - low_t
  - Compute body size: |open_t - close_t|
  - Calculate true range: max(high_t - low_t, abs(high_t - close_(t-1)), abs(low_t - close_(t-1)))
- Calculate volume and amount-based features
  - Compute change in volume: volume_t - volume_(t-1)
  - Compute change in amount: amount_t - amount_(t-1)
  - Compute volume-weighted average price (VWAP): sum(price * volume) / sum(volume) over a lookback period
- Calculate volatility measures
  - Compute standard deviation of daily returns over a lookback period
- Calculate momentum indicators
  - Compute simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over a lookback period
  - Compute exponential moving average (EMA) of closing prices over a lookback period
  - Compute relative strength index (RSI) over a lookback period
- Calculate trend indicators
  - Compute moving average convergence divergence (MACD) using EMAs with different periods
  - Compute difference between two SMAs to indicate trend direction
- Calculate candlestick pattern recognition
  - Identify doji patterns where open and close are very close
  - Identify bullish and bearish engulfing patterns
- Calculate money flow and accumulation/distribution
  - Compute money flow index (MFI) using typical price and volume
  - Compute on-balance volume (OBV) as a cumulative sum of volume based on whether the close is higher or lower than the previous close
- Calculate breakout and resistance levels
  - Compute rolling maximum of high prices over a lookback period
  - Compute rolling minimum of low prices over a lookback period
- Combine features for comprehensive alpha factor
  - Create a composite score by weighting and combining the above features
  - Use this composite score to predict future stock returns
