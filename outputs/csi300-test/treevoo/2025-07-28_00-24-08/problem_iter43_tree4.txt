- Develop alpha factors using price and volume data only
  - Focus on trend and momentum indicators
    - Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over a specified lookback period (e.g., 50, 100, or 200 days)
      - Use the difference between the current close and SMA to assess short-term trend strength
    - Utilize a weighted moving average (WMA), assigning more weight to recent prices, to identify momentum changes
  - Incorporate volatility measures
    - Compute the Average True Range (ATR) from high, low, and close prices for gauging market volatility
      - Integrate ATR into signals by adjusting entry and exit thresholds based on volatility
    - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns as an additional measure of price volatility
  - Examine relationship between price and volume
    - Generate Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator from high, low, close prices, and volume to analyze buying and selling pressure
      - Consider CMF crossing above/below a certain level (e.g., 0) as buy/sell signals
    - Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV) to track cumulative trading volume flow
  - Explore relative strength concepts
    - Compute the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions
      - Apply RSI divergence, comparing its trend against the price trend, as a predictive factor
- Investigate inter-market analysis opportunities
  - Compare the target stock's performance with relevant market indexes
    - Measure correlation and cointegration coefficients to find leading/lagging relationships
- Analyze intraday patterns
  - Identify key intraday support and resistance levels from open, high, low, and close prices
    - Use these levels as potential reversal points for setting up trades
  - Construct a Renko chart using close prices to visualize price movements in fixed size blocks, offering clearer trend identification
- Look at seasonal and cyclical factors
  - Assess historical price and volume trends during specific times of the year
    - For example, end-of-month, quarter, or pre/post earnings announcement effects
- Implement machine learning models directly on raw data
  - Employ feature engineering techniques specifically tailored to financial time series
    - Include autoregressive features and rolling statistics without normalization
