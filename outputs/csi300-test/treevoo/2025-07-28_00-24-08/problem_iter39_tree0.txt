Thought: Develop a momentum factor using price data
- Sub-thought: Calculate the return over a short-term period (e.g., 5 days)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the percentage change from the close price of 5 days ago to today's close
- Sub-thought: Calculate the return over a medium-term period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the percentage change from the close price of 20 days ago to today's close
- Sub-thought: Combine the short and medium-term returns into a composite score
  - Sub-sub-thought: Use a weighted sum of the two returns, with more weight on the short-term return

Thought: Create an alpha factor based on trading volume
- Sub-thought: Measure the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume over the past N days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Determine the average volume by summing the volumes over the past N days and dividing by N
- Sub-thought: Consider the change in volume as a potential signal
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the percentage increase or decrease of today's volume compared to the previous day
- Sub-thought: Integrate recent volume trend into the factor
  - Sub-sub-thought: Evaluate the slope of a linear regression model fitted to the volume data over the past M days

Thought: Formulate a volatility-based alpha factor
- Sub-thought: Assess the daily price range
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the high and low for each day
- Sub-thought: Calculate the standard deviation of daily close prices over the last P days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the average of the squared differences between each day's close and the mean close over P days, then take the square root
- Sub-thought: Create a composite volatility measure
  - Sub-sub-thought: Combine the daily price range and the standard deviation of close prices, possibly by taking their geometric mean

Thought: Utilize transaction amount (dollar volume) for an alpha factor
- Sub-thought: Track the total transaction amount over a specified time frame
  - Sub-sub-thought: Sum the amount (price * volume) for each day within the time frame
- Sub-thought: Analyze the consistency of the transaction amounts
  - Sub-sub-thought: Measure the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) of the transaction amounts over the past Q days
- Sub-thought: Incorporate the trend in transaction amounts
  - Sub-sub-thought: Fit a simple linear regression line to the transaction amounts over the last R days and use the slope as an indicator
