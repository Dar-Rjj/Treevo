Performing alpha mining, generate novel and interpretable alpha factors that could help predict future stock returns.
- Using Price Data (open, high, low, close) to Generate Alpha Factors
  - Momentum-based Factors
    - Exponential Moving Average of Close Prices Over a Period
    - Rate of Change in Close Prices from Previous Day
    - Relative Strength (Ratio of Close Price to Its N-period Moving Average)
  - Volatility-based Factors
    - Daily Price Range (High - Low)
    - Average True Range (ATR) Over a Period
    - True Range (Maximum of High-Low, High-Previous Close, Low-Previous Close)
