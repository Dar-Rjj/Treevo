Synthesized Alpha Factor Combining High-Low Volatility, Intraday and Long-Term Momentum, and Volume-Adjusted Price Dynamics
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   └── Compute as (High - Low) / Close
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   └── Compute as (Close - Open) / Open
├── Calculate Previous Day Overnight Return
│   └── Compute as (Current Close - Previous Day's Close) / Previous Day's Close
├── Aggregate Returns
│   ├── Combine Intraday Return
│   └── Combine Previous Day Overnight Return
├── Adjust for Volume
│   └── Multiply Aggregate Returns by Volume
├── Weight by Intraday Volatility
│   └── Multiply Intraday Volatility with Adjusted Aggregate Returns
├── Smoothed Moving Average
│   ├── Calculate Simple Moving Average of Weighted Adjusted Returns
│   │   └── Compute Average over Last 5 days
│   └── Apply Exponential Smoothing
│       └── Apply Exponential Smoothing Factor
├── Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract the 7-day ago Close price from the Current Close price
├── Calculate Long-Term Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract the 25-day ago Close price from the Current Close price

│       └── Compare Today's Volume with 7-Day Average Volume
│   ├── If Volume is Above Average, Multiply Combined Price Momentum and Intraday Reversal by 1.8
│   └── If Volume is Below or Equal to Average, Multiply by 0.7
├── Incorporate High-Low Volatility into Final Factor
