- Begin with fundamental components: open, high, low, close, amount, and volume
  - Calculate daily price changes
    - Daily return = (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
    - Use daily returns for further analysis
  - Explore momentum factors
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
      - Short-term SMA (e.g., 5 days): sma_5 = (close_t + close_t-1 + ... + close_t-4) / 5
      - Long-term SMA (e.g., 20 days): sma_20 = (close_t + ... + close_t-19) / 20
      - Momentum factor: momentum = sma_5 - sma_20
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
      - EMA with a smoothing factor of 0.1: ema_t = (close_t * 0.1) + (ema_t-1 * 0.9), where ema_0 = close_0
      - Momentum factor: momentum_ema = ema_t - ema_t-5
  - Analyze volatility
    - Price range = high_t - low_t
    - Average true range over n days: atr_n = (sum(range_t to range_t-n+1)) / n
    - Volatility factor: volatility = atr_n
    - Calculate Intraday Return
      - Use Close price
      - Use Open price
      - Compute as (Close - Open) / Open
    - Calculate Previous Day Overnight Return
      - Use Current Day's Close price
      - Use Previous Day's Close price
      - Compute as (Current Close - Previous Day's Close) / Previous Day's Close
    - Aggregate Returns
      - Combine Intraday Return
      - Combine Previous Day Overnight Return
    - Weight by Intraday Volatility
      - Use Intraday Volatility
      - Multiply Intraday Volatility with Aggregate Returns
    - Adjust for Volume
      - Use Volume
      - Multiply Weighted Aggregate Returns by Volume
    - Incorporate High-Low Volatility into Final Factor
      - Use High-Low Range
      - Use Intraday Volatility
      - Multiply High-Low Range by Intraday Volatility
  - Investigate volume-based indicators
    - Volume change: volume_change = volume_t - volume_t-1
    - Volume weighted average price (VWAP)
      - Cumulative VWAP: vwap_t = (cumulative(sum(close_i * volume_i) from i=0 to t) / cumulative(sum(volume_i) from i=0 to t))
      - Deviation from VWAP: vwap_deviation = close_t - vwap_t
    - Apply Volume Confirmation
      - If Volume of day t > Volume of day t-1, Set to 1
      - Else, Set to 0
  - Combine multiple factors
    - Composite factor: composite = w1 * momentum + w2 * volatility + w3 * vwap_deviation, where w1, w2, w3 are weights
  - Consider transaction amounts
    - Amount change: amount_change = amount_t - amount_t-1
    - Transaction intensity: transaction_intensity = amount_change / volume_change
  - Generate alpha signals
    - Alpha signal: if (composite > threshold) then buy, else sell
  - Incorporate additional factors
    - Relative strength index (RSI)
      - RSI with a period of 14 days: rsi_14 = 100 - (100 / (1 + (average gain / average loss)))
      - RSI factor: rsi_factor = rsi_14
    - On-balance volume (OBV)
      - OBV calculation: obv_t = obv_t-1 + (volume_t * (close_t - close_t-1) / |close_t - close_t-1|)
      - OBV factor: obv_factor = obv_t
    - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
      - MACD line: macd_line = ema_t-12 - ema_t-26
      - Signal line: signal_line = 9-day EMA of macd_line
      - MACD histogram: macd_histogram = macd_line - signal_line
      - MACD factor: macd_factor = macd_histogram
  - Integrate all components
    - Smoothed Moving Average
      - Calculate Simple Moving Average of Volume-Adjusted Returns
      - Use Last 5 days of Volume-Adjusted Returns
      - Compute Average
      - Apply Exponential Smoothing
        - Use Simple Moving Average
        - Apply Exponential Smoothing Factor
    - Compute Price Momentum
      - Sum Last 2
