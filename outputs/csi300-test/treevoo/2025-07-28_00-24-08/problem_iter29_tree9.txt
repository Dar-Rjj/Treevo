Synthesize Price, Volume, and Momentum to Create Enhanced Alpha Factors
├── Calculate Daily Return
│   └── Use closing prices of day t and day t-1
├── Identify Trends in Daily Returns
│   └── Compute the sum of daily returns over the past 5 days
├── Analyze Intraday Volatility
│   └── Compute as (High - Low) / Close
├── Explore Trading Volume Patterns
│   ├── Determine the average trading volume over the past 10 days
│   └── Evaluate the ratio of today's volume to the 10-day average volume
├── Consider Price Momentum
│   └── Calculate the difference between today's close and the lowest low over the last 30 days
├── Investigate the Relationship Between Price Change and Volume
│   └── Find the correlation between daily return and volume over the last 60 days
├── Examine Market Strength
│   └── Assess the number of days in the last 10 where the closing price was higher than the opening price
├── Look for Buying or Selling Pressure
│   └── Check if the closing price is within the top third of the (high, low) range more often than not in the past 7 days
├── Short-Term Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract the 5-day ago Close price from the Current Close price
├── Long-Term Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract the 20-day ago Close price from the Current Close price
├── Price Momentum Ratio
│   └── Divide Short-Term Price Momentum by Long-Term Price Momentum
├── Volume-Weighted High-Low Volatility
│   ├── Weight High-Low Range by Volume
│   │   ├── Use High-Low Range
│   │   └── Use Volume
│   └── Adjust by Average Volume
│       ├── Use Volume-weighted High-Low Range
│       └── Use Average Volume
├── Integrate Factors
│   ├── Conditionally Adjust by Volume Metrics
│   │   ├── If Volume is Above Average, Multiply by 1.5
│   │   └── If Volume is Below or Equal to Average, Multiply by 0.5
│   └── Combine with Intraday and Previous Day's Returns
│       └── Multiply Intraday Return by Previous Day's Close-to-Open Return
├── Smoothed Moving Average
│   ├── Calculate Simple Moving Average of Weighted Adjusted Returns
│   │   └── Compute Average over Last 5 days
│   └── Apply Exponential Smoothing
│       └── Apply Exponential Smoothing Factor
├── Integrate Intraday and Previous Day's Returns
│   └── Multiply Intraday Return by Previous Day's Close-to-Open Return
├── Combine Price Momentum and Intraday Reversal
│   └── Multiply Price Momentum Ratio by Integrated Intraday and Previous Day's Returns
├── Conditionally Adjust by Volume Surge
│   ├── Calculate 7-Day Average Volume
│   │   └── Divide Sum of Last 7 Days' Volumes by 7
│   └── Determine if Today's Volume is Above 7-Day Average
│       └── Compare Today's Volume with 7-Day Average Volume
│   ├── If Volume is Above Average, Multiply Combined Price Momentum and Intraday Reversal by 1.8
│   └── If Volume is Below or Equal to Average, Multiply by 0.7
├── Incorporate High-Low Volatility into Final Factor
│   ├── Use Intraday Volatility
│   └── Multiply Intraday Volatility by High-Low Range
└── Generate Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Smoothed Moving Average with Conditionally Adjusted Price Momentum
    ├── Add High-Low Volatility
