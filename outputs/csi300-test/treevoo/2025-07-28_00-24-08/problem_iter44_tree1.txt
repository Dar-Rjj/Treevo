- Develop alpha factors using price and volume data only
  - Focus on trend and momentum indicators
    - Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over a specified lookback period (e.g., 50, 100, or 200 days)
      - Use the difference between the current close and SMA to assess short-term trend strength
    - Utilize a weighted moving average (WMA), assigning more weight to recent prices, to identify momentum changes
    - Calculate daily percentage change in closing prices
      - Calculation: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
      - Interpretation: Measures the percentage change in closing prices from one day to the next, indicating momentum.
    - Combined Momentum
      - Calculation: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1} + (Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}) / Volume_{t-1}
      - Interpretation: Summation of price and volume momentum, aiming to capture overall market sentiment.
  - Incorporate volatility measures
    - Compute the Average True Range (ATR) from high, low, and close prices for gauging market volatility
      - Integrate ATR into signals by adjusting entry and exit thresholds based on volatility
    - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns as an additional measure of price volatility
    - High-Low Range
      - Calculation: High_t - Low_t
      - Interpretation: Represents daily price volatility, useful for identifying market stress or calm.
    - Volatility-Adjusted Returns
      - Calculation: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / (High_t - Low_t)
      - Interpretation: Normalizes return by intraday volatility, highlighting stable or erratic gains.
  - Examine relationship between price and volume
    - Generate Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator from high, low, close prices, and volume to analyze buying and selling pressure
      - Consider CMF crossing above/below a certain level (e.g., 0) as buy/sell signals
    - Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV) to track cumulative trading volume flow
    - Price-Volume Correlation
      - Calculation: Corr((Close_t - Close_{t-1}), (Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}))
      - Interpretation: Captures the relationship between price movements and volume changes, signaling potential trend strength.
    - Transaction Size Adjusted Volatility
      - Calculation: (High_t - Low_t) * (Amount_t / Volume_t)
      - Interpretation: Adjusts daily price range by the average transaction size, potentially revealing underlying liquidity conditions.
  - Explore relative strength concepts
    - Compute the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions
      - Apply RSI divergence, comparing its trend against the price trend, as a predictive factor
    - Trend Following Factor
      - Calculation: SMA(Close, n) - Close
      - Interpretation: Compares the simple moving average of close prices with the current close price to identify trends.
    - Breakout Signal
      - Calculation: (Close_t > Max(High_{t-1}, t-2, ..., t-n)) ? 1 : 0
      - Interpretation: Identifies days when the closing price exceeds recent high prices, indicating potential breakout opportunities.
- Investigate inter-market analysis opportunities
  - Compare the target stock's performance with relevant market indexes
    - Measure correlation and cointegration coefficients to find leading/lagging relationships
- Analyze intraday patterns
  - Identify key intraday support and resistance levels from open, high, low, and close prices
    - Use these levels as potential reversal points for setting up trades
  - Construct a Renko chart using close prices to visualize price movements in fixed size blocks, offering clearer trend identification
- Look at seasonal and cyclical factors
  - Assess historical price and volume trends during specific times of the year
    - For example, end-of-month, quarter, or pre/post earnings announcement effects
- Implement machine learning models directly on raw data
  - Employ feature engineering techniques specifically tailored to financial time series
    - Include autoregressive features and rolling statistics without normalization
