├── Standard Deviation of Daily Returns
│   ├── Compute the standard deviation over a lookback period, such as 20 days
│   └── Utilize this standard deviation directly as a measure of volatility
├── Volume-to-Average Volume Ratio
│   ├── Calculate the ratio of the current day's volume to the average volume over the past n days, where n could be 30
│   └── Use this ratio as an indicator of relative trading activity
├── High-Low Spread Indicators
│   ├── Compute the difference between high and low prices for each day
│   ├── Sum these differences over a certain period, for example, the last 10 days
│   └── A smaller sum might imply a period of consolidation or stability, whereas a larger sum could suggest increased volatility
├── Consecutive Bullish Days
│   ├── Identify consecutive days where the close is above the open (indicative of bullishness)
│   └── Count the number of such occurrences within a specified timeframe, like 7 days
