- Begin with fundamental components: open, high, low, close, amount, and volume
  - Calculate daily price changes
    - Daily return = (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
    - Use daily returns for further analysis
  - Explore momentum factors
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
      - Short-term SMA (e.g., 5 days): sma_5 = (close_t + close_t-1 + ... + close_t-4) / 5
      - Long-term SMA (e.g., 20 days): sma_20 = (close_t + ... + close_t-19) / 20
      - Momentum factor: momentum = sma_5 - sma_20
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
      - EMA with a smoothing factor of 0.1: ema_t = (close_t * 0.1) + (ema_t-1 * 0.9), where ema_0 = close_0
      - Momentum factor: momentum_ema = ema_t - ema_t-5
  - Analyze volatility
    - Price range = high_t - low_t
    - Average true range over n days: atr_n = (sum(range_t to range_t-n+1)) / n
    - Volatility factor: volatility = atr_n
  - Investigate volume-based indicators
    - Volume change: volume_change = volume_t - volume_t-1
    - Volume weighted average price (VWAP)
      - Cumulative VWAP: vwap_t = (cumulative(sum(close_i * volume_i) from i=0 to t) / cumulative(sum(volume_i) from i=0 to t))
      - Deviation from VWAP: vwap_deviation = close_t - vwap_t
  - Combine multiple factors
    - Composite factor: composite = w1 * momentum + w2 * volatility + w3 * vwap_deviation, where w1, w2, w3 are weights
  - Consider transaction amounts
    - Amount change: amount_change = amount_t - amount_t-1
    - Transaction intensity: transaction_intensity = amount_change / volume_change
  - Generate alpha signals
    - Alpha signal: if (composite > threshold) then buy, else sell
- End of tree
