- Calculate the Moving Averages
  - Use closing prices to calculate the short-term (e.g., 5-day) moving average
  - Use closing prices to calculate the long-term (e.g., 20-day) moving average
  - Calculate the difference between the short-term and long-term moving averages as a factor

- Analyze Price Gaps
  - Calculate the opening price gap: Open(t) - Close(t-1)
  - Calculate the closing price gap: Close(t) - Open(t)
  - Consider the absolute value of the opening price gap as a factor
  - Consider the absolute value of the closing price gap as a factor

- Volume Analysis
  - Calculate the change in volume: Volume(t) - Volume(t-1)
  - Consider the sign of the volume change as a factor
  - Calculate the ratio of the current day's volume to the previous day's volume: Volume(t) / Volume(t-1)
  - Consider this volume ratio as a factor

- Price Range Factors
  - Calculate the daily price range: High(t) - Low(t)
  - Calculate the upper shadow: High(t) - Max(Open(t), Close(t))
  - Calculate the lower shadow: Min(Open(t), Close(t)) - Low(t)
  - Consider the daily price range as a factor
  - Consider the upper shadow as a factor
  - Consider the lower shadow as a factor

- Momentum Indicators
  - Calculate the Rate of Change (ROC) for the closing price: (Close(t) - Close(t-n)) / Close(t-n)
  - Consider the ROC over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days) as factors
  - Calculate the True Range (TR) as the maximum of the following:
    - High(t) - Low(t)
    - Abs(High(t) - Close(t-1))
    - Abs(Low(t) - Close(t-1))
  - Consider the True Range as a factor

- Money Flow Factors
  - Calculate the Typical Price: (High(t) + Low(t) + Close(t)) / 3
  - Calculate the Money Flow: Typical Price * Volume
  - Calculate the Positive and Negative Money Flows
  - Consider the difference between positive and negative money flows as a factor

- Volatility Indicators
  - Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) over a period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Consider the ATR as a factor
  - Calculate the Bollinger Bands using the 20-day moving average and 2 standard deviations
  - Consider the distance of the closing price from the upper and lower Bollinger Bands as factors
