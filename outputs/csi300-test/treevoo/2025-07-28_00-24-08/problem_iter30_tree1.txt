Explore Momentum Factors
├── Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│   ├── Short-term SMA (e.g., 5 days): sma_5 = (close_t + close_t-1 + ... + close_t-4) / 5
│   └── Long-term SMA (e.g., 20 days): sma_20 = (close_t + ... + close_t-19) / 20
│   └── Momentum factor: momentum = sma_5 - sma_20
└── Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    ├── EMA with a smoothing factor of 0.1: ema_t = (close_t * 0.1) + (ema_t-1 * 0.9), where ema_0 = close_0
    └── Momentum factor: momentum_ema = ema_t - ema_t-5
Analyze Volatility
├── Price range = high_t - low_t
└── Average true range over n days: atr_n = (sum(range_t to range_t-n+1)) / n
    └── Volatility factor: volatility = atr_n
Investigate Volume-Based Indicators
├── Volume change: volume_change = volume_t - volume_t-1
└── Volume weighted average price (VWAP)
    ├── Cumulative VWAP: vwap_t = (cumulative(sum(close_i * volume_i) from i=0 to t) / cumulative(sum(volume_i) from i=0 to t))
    └── Deviation from VWAP: vwap_deviation = close_t - vwap_t
Combine Multiple Factors
├── Composite factor: composite = w1 * momentum + w2 * volatility + w3 * vwap_deviation, where w1, w2, w3 are weights
Consider Transaction Amounts
├── Amount change: amount_change = amount_t - amount_t-1
└── Transaction intensity: transaction_intensity = amount_change / volume_change
