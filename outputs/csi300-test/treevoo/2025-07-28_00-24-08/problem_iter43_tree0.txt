- Explore historical price patterns
  - Calculate daily return
    - (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t
  - Calculate change in volume
    - Volume_t - Volume_(t-1)
  - Analyze intra-day volatility
    - High_t - Low_t
  - Identify trends using moving averages
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close prices
      - SMA_5: Sum(Close_t, Close_(t-1), ..., Close_(t-4)) / 5
      - SMA_20: Sum(Close_t, Close_(t-1), ..., Close_(t-19)) / 20
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close prices
      - EMA_t = (Close_t * α) + (EMA_(t-1) * (1 - α))
        - where α = 2 / (n + 1), n is the number of periods
  - Momentum indicators
    - Rate of Change (ROC)
      - ROC_14: (Close_t - Close_(t-14)) / Close_(t-14)
    - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
      - MACD Line: EMA_12 - EMA_26
      - Signal Line: 9-period EMA of MACD Line
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - RSI_14: 100 - (100 / (1 + (Average Gain / Average Loss)))
      - Where Average Gain = (Sum of gains over 14 periods) / 14
      - Where Average Loss = (Sum of losses over 14 periods) / 14
  - Volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
    - VWAP_t = (Cumulative(Typical Price * Volume) / Cumulative(Volume))
      - Typical Price = (High_t + Low_t + Close_t) / 3
- Incorporate trading volume and amount
  - Calculate volume ratio
    - Volume_t / Volume_(t-1)
  - Calculate amount ratio
    - Amount_t / Amount_(t-1)
- Analyze market breadth
  - New highs and lows
    - Count of new 52-week highs and lows
  - Advance/Decline line
    - Number of advancing stocks - number of declining stocks
- Use on-balance volume (OBV)
  - OBV_t = OBV_(t-1) + (Volume_t if Close_t > Close_(t-1)) - (Volume_t if Close_t < Close_(t-1))
- Incorporate technical indicators
  - Bollinger Bands
    - Middle Band: 20-day SMA of Close prices
    - Upper Band: Middle Band + 2 * Standard Deviation of Close prices (last 20 days)
    - Lower Band: Middle Band - 2 * Standard Deviation of Close prices (last 20 days)
  - Stochastic Oscillator
    - %K = (Close_t - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) * 100
    - %D = 3-period SMA of %K
- Analyze order flow imbalance
  - Order flow ratio
    - (Buy Volume - Sell Volume) / Total Volume
  - Large trades
    - Count and volume of trades above a certain threshold
- Consider external factors
  - Market sentiment
    - Sentiment score from news articles or social media
  - Economic indicators
    - Changes in interest rates, inflation, and GDP
- Combine multiple factors
  - Factor combination
    - Linear combination of selected factors
    - Factor weighting
      - Weights based on historical performance
- Evaluate and refine
  - Backtest alpha factors
    - Performance evaluation using Sharpe ratio, Information ratio, and other metrics
  - Refine and optimize
    - Adjust parameters and combinations to improve predictive power
