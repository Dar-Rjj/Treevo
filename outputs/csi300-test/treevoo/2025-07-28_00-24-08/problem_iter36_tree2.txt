Thought: Explore price patterns and trading volume to derive predictive alpha factors
    Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between close prices and trading volumes
        Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between today's close and the previous day's close
            Sub-thought: Combine with the ratio of today's volume to the previous day's volume
                Sub-thought: Use the product of the close difference and volume ratio as a factor
    Sub-thought: Examine intraday price movements for potential signals
        Sub-thought: Determine the range (high - low) for each day
            Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the high and the close
                Sub-thought: Derive a factor by dividing the high-close difference by the range
        Sub-thought: Consider the open price in relation to the close
            Sub-thought: Calculate the open-to-close return
                Sub-thought: Use this return as a direct factor
            Sub-thought: Compare the open-to-close return with the overall range
                Sub-thought: Calculate the absolute difference between open and close, then divide by the range
                    Sub-thought: Use this normalized difference as a factor
    Sub-thought: Investigate the influence of trading amount on price behavior
        Sub-thought: Calculate the average trading amount over the past n days
            Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of today's amount to the moving average
                Sub-thought: Use this ratio as an indicator of unusual trading activity
            Sub-thought: Combine this ratio with the close-to-open return
                Sub-thought: Multiply the close-to-open return by the ratio to create a composite factor
