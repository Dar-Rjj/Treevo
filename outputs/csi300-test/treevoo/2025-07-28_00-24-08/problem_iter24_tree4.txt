Synthesized Alpha Factor Combining High-Low Volatility, Intraday and Long-Term Momentum, and Volume-Adjusted Price Dynamics
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   └── Compute as (High - Low) / Close
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   └── Compute as (Close - Open) / Open
├── Calculate Previous Day Overnight Return
│   └── Compute as (Current Close - Previous Day's Close) / Previous Day's Close
├── Aggregate Returns
│   ├── Combine Intraday Return
│   └── Combine Previous Day Overnight Return
├── Adjust for Volume
│   └── Multiply Aggregate Returns by Volume
├── Weight by Intraday Volatility
│   └── Multiply Intraday Volatility with Adjusted Aggregate Returns
├── Smoothed Moving Average
│   ├── Calculate Simple Moving Average of Weighted Adjusted Returns
│   │   └── Compute Average over Last 10 days
│   └── Apply Exponential Smoothing
│       └── Apply Exponential Smoothing Factor
├── Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract the 5-day ago Close price from the Current Close price
├── Calculate Long-Term Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract the 30-day ago Close price from the Current Close price
├── Compute Price Momentum Ratio
│   └── Divide Short-Term Price Momentum by Long-Term Price Momentum
├── Integrate Intraday and Previous Day's Returns
│   └── Multiply Intraday Return by Previous Day's Close-to-Open Return
├── Combine Price Momentum and Intraday Reversal
│   └── Multiply Price Momentum Ratio by Integrated Intraday and Previous Day's Returns
├── Conditionally Adjust by Volume Surge
│   ├── Calculate 10-Day Average Volume
│   │   └── Divide Sum of Last 10 Days' Volumes by 10
│   └── Determine if Today's Volume is Above 10-Day Average
│       └── Compare Today's Volume with 10-Day Average Volume
│   ├── If Volume is Above Average, Multiply Combined Price Momentum and Intraday Reversal by 2.0
│   └── If Volume is Below or Equal to Average, Multiply by 0.5
└── Generate Final Alpha Factor
    └── Combine Smoothed Moving Average with Conditionally Adjusted Price Momentum
