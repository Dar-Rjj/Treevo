Performing alpha mining, generate novel and interpretable alpha factors that could help predict future stock returns.
- Using Price Data (open, high, low, close) to Generate Alpha Factors
  - Momentum-based Factors
    - Exponential Moving Average of Close Prices Over a Period
    - Rate of Change in Close Prices from Previous Day with Smoothing
  - Volatility-based Factors
    - Daily Price Range (High - Low)
    - True Range (TR) Over a Period
  - Trend Strength Indicators
    - Directional Movement (DM) Indicators
    - ADX (Average Directional Index) with Dynamic Thresholds
- Incorporating Volume and Amount in Alpha Factor Generation
  - Volume-related Factors
    - Volume Relative to a Weighted Moving Average of Volume
    - Cumulative Volume Changes Over a Specific Period with Exponential Decay
