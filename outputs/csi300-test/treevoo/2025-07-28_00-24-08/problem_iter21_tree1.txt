- Develop Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume Data
  - Momentum-based Factors
    - Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the close price over a window, say 50 days.
      - Subtract the SMA from the current day's closing price to find the deviation.
        - Use this deviation as an alpha factor; positive values may indicate upward momentum.
  - Volatility-based Factors
    - Compute the standard deviation of the daily returns over a lookback period, such as 20 days.
      - Utilize this standard deviation directly as a measure of volatility, with higher values suggesting potentially larger price swings in either direction.
  - Volume-related Factors
    - Calculate the ratio of the current day's volume to the average volume over the past n days, where n could be 30.
      - This ratio can serve as an indicator of relative trading activity or interest, possibly signaling significant market moves.
  - High-Low Spread Indicators
    - Compute the difference between high and low prices for each day.
      - Sum these differences over a certain period, for example, the last 10 days.
        - A smaller sum might imply a period of consolidation or stability, whereas a larger sum could suggest increased volatility or indecision.
  - Price Patterns
    - Identify consecutive days where the close is above the open (indicative of bullishness).
      - Count the number of such occurrences within a specified timeframe, like 7 days.
        - An increasing count could signal a strengthening uptrend.
  - Combined Metrics
    - Blend multiple calculated factors, such as the momentum deviation and the volatility standard deviation, by averaging them.
      - This composite factor could provide a more robust indication of future performance by considering both trend and risk.
