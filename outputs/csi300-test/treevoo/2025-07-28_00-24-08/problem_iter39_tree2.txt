    Thought: Use open, high, low, and close prices to compute medium-term momentum
        Thought: Compute 20-day average return ((close_t + open_t + high_t + low_t)/4 - (close_(t-20) + open_(t-20) + high_(t-20) + low_(t-20))/4)
        Thought: Compute 30-day average return ((close_t + open_t + high_t + low_t)/4 - (close_(t-30) + open_(t-30) + high_(t-30) + low_(t-30))/4)
    Thought: Use volume to compute volume-weighted momentum
