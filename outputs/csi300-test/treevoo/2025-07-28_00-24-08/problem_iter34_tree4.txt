Alpha Mining Thought Tree
- Price Momentum
  - Calculate the close price difference over a period (e.g., 5 days)
  - Determine if the closing price is above or below the short-term moving average (e.g., 10 days)
- Volume Analysis
  - Evaluate the volume change over a period (e.g., 5 days)
  - Identify if the current day's volume is significantly higher than the previous day
- Price and Volume Correlation
  - Assess the relationship between price changes and volume changes over a period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Detect if there is a positive or negative correlation between price and volume
- High-Low Range
  - Calculate the difference between high and low prices for each day
  - Identify if the high-low range is increasing or decreasing over a period (e.g., 10 days)
- Opening Price Behavior
  - Compare the opening price with the previous day's closing price
  - Determine if the stock opens with a gap up or down
- Candlestick Pattern Recognition
  - Recognize specific candlestick patterns (e.g., Doji, Hammer, Engulfing) in the recent price history
  - Use the pattern to infer potential future price direction
- Moving Average Crossover
  - Check for crossovers between short-term and long-term moving averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day)
  - Indicate if the short-term moving average crosses above or below the long-term moving average
- Relative Strength
  - Compute the relative strength of the stock compared to a benchmark index
  - Determine if the stock is outperforming or underperforming the index
- Trend Following
  - Use a trend-following indicator (e.g., ADX) to measure the strength of the current trend
  - Identify if the trend is strong or weak
- Volatility
  - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a period (e.g., 30 days)
  - Determine if the current volatility is high or low
- Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
  - Calculate the VWAP for the day
  - Compare the closing price with the VWAP to determine if the stock is trading above or below the VWAP
- Accumulation/Distribution Line
  - Track the accumulation/distribution line over a period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Determine if the line is rising or falling, indicating buying or selling pressure
- On-Balance Volume (OBV)
  - Calculate the OBV
  - Identify if the OBV is increasing or decreasing, suggesting accumulation or distribution
- Price and Volume Divergence
  - Look for divergence between price and an indicator like OBV or A/D line
  - Infer if the divergence suggests a potential reversal in price
- Money Flow Index (MFI)
  - Compute the MFI over a period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Determine if the MFI indicates overbought or oversold conditions
- Williams %R
  - Calculate the Williams %R over a period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Determine if the %R indicates overbought or oversold conditions

  - Compute the Stochastic Oscillator over a period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Determine if the oscillator indicates overbought or oversold conditions
- RSI
  - Calculate the RSI over a period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Determine if the RSI indicates overbought or oversold conditions
- MACD
  - Compute the MACD line and signal line
  - Identify if the MACD line crosses above or below the signal line
- Bollinger Bands
  - Calculate the upper and lower Bollinger Bands
  - Determine if the price is touching or breaking through the bands

  - Calculate the Donchian Channels (upper and lower bands)
  - Determine if the price is touching or breaking through the channels
- Chaikin Oscillator
  - Compute the Chaikin Oscillator
  - Identify if the oscillator is positive or negative, indicating buying or selling pressure
- Ease of Movement (EOM)
  - Calculate the EOM over a period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Determine if the EOM is increasing or decreasing, suggesting ease or difficulty in price movement
- Force Index
  - Compute the Force Index over a period (e.g., 13 days)
  - Determine if the Force Index is positive or negative, indicating buying or selling pressure
- Market Breadth
  - Track market breadth indicators (e.g., advance-decline line)
  - Determine if the market breadth is expanding or contracting
