Synthesized and Enhanced Intraday Momentum Adjusted for Volume, Price Spikes, and Volatility
├── Compute Intraday Momentum
│   └── (High - Low) + (Close - Open)
├── Compute Combined Intraday Features
│   ├── Subtract Intraday Midpoint from Open price
│   └── Subtract Opening Gap from result
│   └── Subtract Previous Close from Open
├── Compute Enhanced Intraday Factor
│   ├── Average Intraday Range over n periods
│   └── Multiply by (Close - Open + Current Close - Previous Close)
│   └── Add Combined Intraday Features
├── Compute Recent Volatility
│   ├── Absolute Price Change: |Current Close - Previous Close|
│   └── Average Absolute Price Change over m periods
│   └── Multiply Enhanced Intraday Factor by this average
├── Compute Volume Spike Factor
│   └── Current Volume / Previous Volume
├── Compute Price Spike Factor
│   └── |Current Close - Previous Close| / |Previous Close - Previous Previous Close|
├── Final Adjusted Momentum
│   └── Intraday Momentum * min(Volume Spike Factor, Price Spike Factor)
├── Adjusted Recent Volatility
│   └── Recent Volatility * min(Volume Spike Factor, Price Spike Factor)
├── Volume Weight
│   ├── Volume
│   └── Average Volume over n periods
│   └── Divide Volume by Average Volume
└── Final Factor
    ├── Enhanced Intraday Factor
    └── Multiply by (Final Adjusted Momentum * Volume Weight)
