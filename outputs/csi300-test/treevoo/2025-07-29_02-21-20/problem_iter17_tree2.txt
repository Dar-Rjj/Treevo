Thought: Crossover of Volume-Adjusted Intraday and Long-Term Momentum with Open-Price Anchoring, Dynamic Volume Sensitivity, and Volume Spike Filtering and Integrated and Synthesized Intraday Momentum, Volume Impact, and Logarithmic Price Changes with Open-Price Anchoring, Reversal, and Spike Filtering

1. Calculate Adjusted Close Price by Open Price
   1.1 Use Close price
   1.2 Subtract Open price

2. Enhanced Intraday Momentum
   2.1 High Price Indicator
      2.1.1 Use High price
      2.1.2 Subtract Open price
   2.2 Low Price Indicator
      2.2.1 Use Open price
      2.2.2 Subtract Low price
   2.3 Average High and Low Price Indicators

3. Adjust for Dynamic Volume Impact on Intraday Momentum
   3.1 Use Volume
   3.2 Calculate Moving Average of Volume
      3.2.1 Define Lookback Period
      3.2.2 Compute Moving Average
   3.3 Normalize Volume by its Moving Average
      3.3.1 Divide Volume by Moving Average of Volume
      3.3.2 Multiply by Enhanced Intraday Momentum result

4. Incorporate Longer-Term Volume-Adjusted Momentum
   4.1 Calculate Long-Term Momentum
      4.1.1 Use Close Price (t) and Close Price (t-n)
      4.1.2 Subtract Close Price (t-n) from Close Price (t)
      4.1.3 Divide by Close Price (t-n)
      4.1.4 Define n as a Lookback Period
   4.2 Adjust for Volume Changes
      4.2.1 Calculate Volume Ratio
         4.2.1.1 Use Volume (t) and Volume (t-n)
         4.2.1.2 Divide Volume (t) by Volume (t-n)
      4.2.2 Combine Long-Term Momentum and Volume Ratio
         4.2.2.1 Multiply Long-Term Momentum by Volume Ratio
         4.2.2.2 Add to the Original Long-Term Momentum
         4.2.2.3 Produce Final Long-Term Factor

5. Consolidate All Factors
   5.1 Sum of Adjusted Close, Volume-Impacted Intraday Momentum, and Volume-Adjusted Long-Term Momentum
   5.2 Divide the Total by Open price

6. Calculate Daily Price Return
   6.1 Use Close price
   6.2 Subtract Previous Day's Close price

7. Identify Significant Price Increase
   7.1 Compare Daily Price Return to Positive Threshold
   7.2 Output 1 if Above, 0 Otherwise

8. Calculate Volume Spike Indicator
   8.1 Use Today's Volume
   8.2 Compare to Average of Past Week Volumes
   8.3 Output 1 if Above, 0 Otherwise

9. Compute Weighted Price Momentum
   9.1 Multiply Daily Price Return by Significant Price Increase Indicator
   9.2 Add Result to Accumulator

10. Apply Volume Spike Filter
    10.1 Multiply Accumulated Momentum by Volume Spike Indicator

11. Final Alpha Factor Synthesis
    11.1 Sum of Consolidated Initial Factors and Volume Spike Filtered Momentum
    11.2 Multiply by Volume Spike Indicator

12. Adjust for Open Price
    12.1 Use Open price
    12.2 Divide by Open price

13. Intraday Logarithmic Changes
    13.1 Calculate Logarithmic Open-Close Change
       13.1.1 Use Open price
       13.1.2 Use Close price
       13.1.3 Subtract and Apply Log Function
    13.2 Calculate Logarithmic High-Low Change
       13.2.1 Use High price
       13.2.2 Use Low price
       13.2.3 Subtract and Apply Log Function

14. Aggregate Intraday Logarithmic Changes
    14.1 Sum Logarithmic Open-Close and High-Low Changes

15. Intraday Momentum Indicators
    15.1 High Price Indicator
       15.1.1 Use High price
       15.1.2 Subtract Open price
    15.2 Low Price Indicator
       15.2.1 Use Open price
       15.2.2 Subtract Low price
    15.3 Multiply High and Low Price Indicators
