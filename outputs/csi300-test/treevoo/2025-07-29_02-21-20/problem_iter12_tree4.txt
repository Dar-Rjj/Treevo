Thought: Begin with Simple Moving Average (SMA) factors to capture trend.
- Sub-thought: Calculate 5-day SMA of closing prices.
- Sub-thought: Calculate 20-day SMA of closing prices.
- Sub-thought: Subtract 20-day SMA from 5-day SMA for a momentum indicator.

Thought: Incorporate Volume-weighted Average Price (VWAP) as a factor for liquidity and market sentiment.
- Sub-thought: Compute daily VWAP using high, low, close, and volume.
- Sub-thought: Calculate 10-day simple moving average of VWAP.
- Sub-thought: Compare today's VWAP with the 10-day SMA of VWAP for a liquidity signal.

Thought: Leverage price range-based indicators to identify volatility.
- Sub-thought: Compute the average true range (ATR) over 14 days using high, low, and previous close.
- Sub-thought: Use ATR in conjunction with recent price action to gauge breakouts or reversals.

Thought: Integrate accumulation/distribution line (A/D Line) for insights into buying and selling pressure.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the A/D Line using high, low, close, and volume.
- Sub-thought: Observe the slope of the A/D Line over the past 30 days to determine buying vs. selling pressure.
- Sub-thought: Cross-reference the A/D Line with price action to find divergences.
