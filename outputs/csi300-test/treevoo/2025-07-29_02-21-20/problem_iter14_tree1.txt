      6.1.1 Use High price
      6.1.2 Subtract Open price
   6.2 Low Price Indicator
      6.2.1 Use Open price

    14.3 Output 1 if Above, 0 Otherwise

15. Compute Weighted Price Momentum
    15.1 Multiply Daily Price Return by Significant Price Increase Indicator
    15.2 Add Result to Accumulator

16. Apply Volume Spike Filter
    16.1 Multiply Accumulated Momentum by Volume Spike Indicator

17. Consolidate Initial Factors
    17.1 Sum of Adjusted Close and Volume-Impacted Intraday Momentum
    17.2 Divide by Open price

18. Final Alpha Factor Synthesis
    18.1 Sum of Consolidated Initial Factors, Volume Spike Filtered Momentum, and Trading Activity Intensity
    18.2 Multiply by Volume Spike Indicator

19. Adjust for Open Price
    19.1 Use Open price
    19.2 Divide by Open price
