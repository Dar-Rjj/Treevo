Enhanced Intraday and Long-Term Momentum with Dynamic Volume Sensitivity and Open-Price Anchoring
├── Adjusted Close Price
│   ├── Subtract Open price (t) from Close price (t)
├── Enhanced Intraday Momentum
│   ├── High-Low Price Indicator
│   │   ├── Subtract Open price (t) from High price (t)

├── Adjust for Dynamic Volume Impact on Intraday Momentum
│   ├── Use Volume (t)

├── Calculate Weighted Intraday Momentum
│   ├── EMA of (Intraday Price Movement * Volume) over 12 days

├── Incorporate Volume-Adjusted Long-Term Momentum
    ├── Long-Term Momentum
    │   ├── Subtract Close Price (t-n) from Close Price (t) (n = 20 days)
    │   └── Divide by Close Price (t-n)
    ├── Adjust for Volume Changes
