Thought: Explore price and volume interactions to generate alpha factors

  Sub-thought: Analyze advanced candlestick patterns for predictive momentum
    Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the difference between high and low prices as a measure of daily volatility
    Sub-sub-thought: Evaluate the body length (difference between open and close) as an indicator of directional movement
    Sub-sub-thought: Identify doji patterns (where open and close are approximately equal) indicating indecision in the market
    Sub-sub-thought: Detect hammer and hanging man patterns to signal potential trend reversals
    Sub-sub-thought: Measure the ratio of body length to total range (high - low) to assess the strength of a trend

  Sub-thought: Examine volume and price relationship for strength signals
    Sub-sub-thought: Compute the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over a lookback period to find unusual trading activity
    Sub-sub-thought: Measure the correlation between closing price change and volume change to assess buying or selling pressure
    Sub-sub-thought: Investigate the impact of high volume with minimal price movement, suggesting accumulation or distribution phases
    Sub-sub-thought: Analyze the effect of consecutive days of increasing volume on future returns
    Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of volume to price change to identify divergence or confirmation of the price trend

  Sub-thought: Construct indicators based on recent price action
    Sub-sub-thought: Develop a short-term moving average crossover system (e.g., 5-day vs 10-day) to detect trend changes
    Sub-sub-thought: Utilize the relative position of the closing price compared to the day's range (close - open / high - low) to quantify bullish or bearish sentiment
    Sub-sub-thought: Create a simple oscillator using the difference between a short-term and long-term moving average to identify overbought or oversold conditions
    Sub-sub-thought: Incorporate a weighted moving average that gives more weight to recent prices to enhance trend detection
    Sub-sub-thought: Develop a volatility-adjusted moving average by incorporating the standard deviation of returns over a lookback period
