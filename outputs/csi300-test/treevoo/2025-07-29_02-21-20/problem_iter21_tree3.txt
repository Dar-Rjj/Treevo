Begin with Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Volume-Adjusted Momentum to capture trend and volume changes.
├── Calculate 5-day SMA of closing prices.
├── Calculate 20-day SMA of closing prices.
├── Subtract 20-day SMA from 5-day SMA for a momentum indicator.
├── Incorporate Volume-weighted Average Price (VWAP) as a factor for liquidity and market sentiment.
│   ├── Compute daily VWAP using high, low, close, and volume.
│   ├── Calculate 10-day simple moving average of VWAP.
│   └── Compare today's VWAP with the 10-day SMA of VWAP for a liquidity signal.
├── Leverage price range-based indicators to identify volatility.
│   ├── Compute the average true range (ATR) over 14 days using high, low, and previous close.
│   └── Use ATR in conjunction with recent price action to gauge breakouts or reversals.
├── Integrate accumulation/distribution line (A/D Line) for insights into buying and selling pressure.
│   ├── Calculate the A/D Line using high, low, close, and volume.
│   ├── Observe the slope of the A/D Line over the past 30 days to determine buying vs. selling pressure.
│   └── Cross-reference the A/D Line with price action to find divergences.
└── Volume-Adjusted Momentum Indicator
    ├── Calculate Momentum
    │   ├── Use Close Price (t) and Close Price (t-20)
    │   │   ├── Subtract Close Price (t-20) from Close Price (t)
    │   │   └── Divide by Close Price (t-20)
    │   └── Define n as a Lookback Period of 20 days
    └── Adjust for Volume Changes
        ├── Calculate Volume Ratio
        │   ├── Use Volume (t) and Volume (t-20)
        │   └── Divide by Volume (t-20)
        └── Combine Momentum and Volume Ratio
            ├── Multiply Momentum by Volume Ratio
            ├── Add to the Original Momentum
            └── Provide Final Alpha Factor
├── Incorporate Relative Strength Index (RSI) for measuring overbought and oversold conditions.
│   ├── Calculate 14-day RSI using closing prices.
│   └── Use RSI to identify potential reversal points.
└── Implement On-Balance Volume (OBV) for additional volume insight.
    ├── Calculate OBV using close and volume.
    ├── Calculate 10-day simple moving average of OBV.
    └── Compare today's OBV with the 10-day SMA of OBV for a volume trend signal.
