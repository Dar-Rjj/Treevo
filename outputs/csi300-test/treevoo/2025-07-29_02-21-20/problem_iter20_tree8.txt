├── Enhanced Intraday Momentum
│   ├── High Price Indicator
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Subtract Open price
│   └── Low Price Indicator
│       ├── Use Open price
│       └── Subtract Low price
│   └── Average High and Low Price Indicators
├── Volume Impact on Intraday Momentum
│   ├── Smooth Volume
│   │   ├── Define Smoothing Factor (alpha)
│   │   └── Compute Exponential Moving Average of Volume
│   └── Multiply Smoothed Volume by Intraday Momentum
├── Long-Term Momentum Adjusted for Volume
    ├── Calculate Long-Term Momentum
    │   ├── Use Close Price (t) and Close Price (t-n)
    │   │   ├── Subtract Close Price (t-n) from Close Price (t)
    │   │   └── Divide by Close Price (t-n)
    │   └── Define n as a Lookback Period

        ├── Calculate Volume Ratio
        │   ├── Use Volume (t) and Volume (t-n)
        │   └── Divide Volume (t) by Volume (t-n)
        └── Combine Long-Term Momentum and Volume Ratio
            ├── Multiply Long-Term Momentum by Volume Ratio
├── Trend Indicators
    ├── Calculate 5-day EMA of closing prices
    └── Calculate 20-day EMA of closing prices
    └── Subtract 20-day EMA from 5-day EMA for a momentum indicator
├── VWAP and Liquidity Signals
    ├── Compute daily VWAP using high, low, close, and volume
    ├── Calculate 10-day exponential moving average of VWAP
    └── Compare today's VWAP with the 10-day EMA of VWAP for a liquidity signal
├── Volatility Indicators
    ├── Compute the average true range (ATR) over 14 days using high, low, and previous close
    └── Calculate the ratio of today's ATR to the 14-day ATR to identify relative volatility spikes
├── Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line) for Buying and Selling Pressure
    ├── Calculate the A/D Line using high, low, close, and volume
    ├── Observe the slope of the A/D Line over the past 30 days to determine buying vs. selling pressure
    └── Calculate the difference between the current A/D Line and its 30-day EMA to highlight significant shifts in buying or selling pressure
└── Consolidate All Factors
    ├── Sum of Adjusted Close, Volume-Impacted Intraday Momentum, and Volume-Adjusted Long-Term Momentum
    ├── Add Trend Indicators, VWAP, Volatility, and A/D Line factors
    └── Divide the Total by Open price
