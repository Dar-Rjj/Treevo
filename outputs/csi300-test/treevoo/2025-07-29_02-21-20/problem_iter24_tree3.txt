Thought: Develop alpha factors using price and volume data
    Thought: Momentum indicators based on price
        Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover
            Thought: Short-term SMA (e.g., 5-day) and Long-term SMA (e.g., 20-day)
                Thought: Calculate 5-day SMA and 20-day SMA
                    Thought: Buy signal when 5-day SMA crosses above 20-day SMA
                    Thought: Sell signal when 5-day SMA crosses below 20-day SMA
        Thought: Price Rate of Change (ROC)
            Thought: Calculate the percentage change in price over a specific period (e.g., 10 days)
                Thought: Buy signal when ROC is positive and increasing
                Thought: Sell signal when ROC is negative and decreasing
    Thought: Volume-based indicators
        Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
            Thought: Calculate cumulative volume based on price movement
                Thought: Add volume on up days, subtract volume on down days
                    Thought: Buy signal when OBV rises
                    Thought: Sell signal when OBV falls
        Thought: Volume Spike Indicator
            Thought: Identify days with significantly higher volume than the average
                Thought: Calculate the average volume over a specific period (e.g., 30 days)
                Thought: Define a threshold (e.g., 2x the average volume) for a spike
                    Thought: Buy signal when a volume spike occurs on an up day
                    Thought: Sell signal when a volume spike occurs on a down day
    Thought: Combined price and volume factors
        Thought: Price-Volume Trend (PVT)
            Thought: Calculate the PVT by summing the product of daily percentage price change and volume
                Thought: Buy signal when PVT is rising
                Thought: Sell signal when PVT is falling
        Thought: Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
            Thought: Calculate VWAP as the sum of (price * volume) divided by the total volume
                Thought: Buy signal when close price is above VWAP
                Thought: Sell signal when close price is below VWAP
