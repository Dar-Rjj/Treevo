Intraday Momentum with Volume Adjusted Price Difference
├── Calculate Intraday Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Weighted Average Price (WAP)
│   ├── Use Open, Close, and Volume
│   │   └── Calculate Weighted Price: (Open + 2*Close) * Volume / 2
│   └── Sum all (weighted price) and divide by sum of volumes
├── Combine Intraday Range and WAP
│   ├── Calculate difference between High and WAP
│   ├── Calculate difference between WAP and Low
│   └── Sum the two differences
└── Apply an exponential moving average to smooth the factor
    ├── Use factor values from the previous n days
    └── Calculate the exponential moving average
