- Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Price Changes
  - Sub-Thought: Daily change in close price (Close_t - Close_{t-1})
  - Sub-Thought: Daily change in high price (High_t - High_{t-1})
  - Sub-Thought: Daily change in low price (Low_t - Low_{t-1})
- Sub-Thought: Identify Multi-Day Price Trends
  - Sub-Thought: 3-day average of daily close price changes
  - Sub-Thought: 7-day average of daily close price changes
  - Sub-Thought: 21-day average of daily close price changes
- Sub-Thought: Measure Volatility
  - Sub-Thought: Standard deviation of daily close price changes over the last 21 days
- Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Volume Changes
  - Sub-Thought: Daily change in volume (Volume_t - Volume_{t-1})
- Sub-Thought: Identify Multi-Day Volume Trends
  - Sub-Thought: 3-day average of daily volume changes
  - Sub-Thought: 7-day average of daily volume changes
  - Sub-Thought: 21-day average of daily volume changes
- Sub-Thought: Identify Gaps and Breaks
  - Sub-Thought: Up gap (Open_t - Close_{t-1} > 0)
  - Sub-Thought: Down gap (Open_t - Close_{t-1} < 0)
  - Sub-Thought: Size of up gap (Open_t - Close_{t-1})
  - Sub-Thought: Size of down gap (Open_t - Close_{t-1})
  - Sub-Thought: Upper breakout (High_t > Max(High_{t-21}, ..., High_{t-1}))
  - Sub-Thought: Lower breakout (Low_t < Min(Low_{t-21}, ..., Low_{t-1}))
  - Sub-Thought: Size of upper breakout (High_t - Max(High_{t-21}, ..., High_{t-1}))
  - Sub-Thought: Size of lower breakout (Min(Low_{t-21}, ..., Low_{t-1}) - Low_t)
- Sub-Thought: Measure Intraday Patterns
  - Sub-Thought: Intraday range (High_t - Low_t)
  - Sub-Thought: Intraday momentum (Close_t - Open_t)
  - Sub-Thought: Strength relative to open (Close_t - Open_t) / (High_t - Low_t)
  - Sub-Thought: Standard deviation of high and low prices over the last 21 days
