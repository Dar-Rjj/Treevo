Intraday Momentum with Volume Weighted Price Difference
├── Calculate Intraday Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
│   ├── Use Open, High, Low, and Close prices
│   │   └── Calculate Typical Price: (Open + High + Low + Close) / 4
│   └── Use Volume
│       └── Multiply each typical price by corresponding volume
│           └── Sum all (volume * typical price) and divide by sum of volumes
├── Combine Intraday Range and VWAP
│   ├── Calculate difference between High and VWAP
│   ├── Calculate difference between VWAP and Low
│   └── Sum the two differences
└── Apply a moving average to smooth the factor
    ├── Use factor values from the previous n days
    └── Calculate the simple moving average
