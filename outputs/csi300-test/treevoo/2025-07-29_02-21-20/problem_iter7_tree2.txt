Crossover of High-to-Low Price Volatility with Volume Adjustment and High-Low Range Volatility Adjusted Momentum
├── Calculate Daily Price Volatility
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
│   └── Calculate Average Daily Range over 20 Days
├── Compute Volume-Based Adjustment Factor
│   ├── Calculate Moving Average of Volume over 20 Days
│   └── Divide Daily Range by Average Daily Range, then multiply by 
│       Volume Relative to its Moving Average
├── Calculate High-Low Price Range Momentum
│   ├── Difference between Close at t and Close at t-10
│   └── Calculate Volume Weighted Average True Range (VWATR)
│       ├── Calculate True Range
│       │   ├── Maximum of High-Low, High-Close(t-1), and Low-Close(t-1)
│       │   └── Multiply True Range by Volume
├── Adjust Momentum by VWATR
│   ├── Divide High-Low Price Range Momentum by VWATR
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Daily Price Volatility
    └── Multiply by Adjusted High-Low Price Range Momentum
