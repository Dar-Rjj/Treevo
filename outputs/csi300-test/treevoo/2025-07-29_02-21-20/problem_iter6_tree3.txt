Intraday Momentum with Volume-Weighted Adjustments and Price Trend Integration
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Typical Price (VATP)
│   ├── Use Open, High, Low, and Close prices
│   │   └── Calculate Typical Price: (High + Low + 2 * Close) / 4
│   └── Use Volume
│       └── Multiply each typical price by the square root of corresponding volume
│           └── Sum all (volume-adjusted typical price) and divide by sum of volumes
├── Integrate Price Trend
│   ├── Calculate the difference between today's VATP and yesterday's VATP
│   └── Add this difference to the Intraday Volatility
├── Combine Intraday Volatility and VATP
│   ├── Calculate difference between High and VATP
│   ├── Calculate difference between VATP and Low
│   └── Sum the two differences
└── Apply a weighted moving average to smooth the factor
    ├── Use factor values from the previous n days
    └── Calculate the weighted moving average with weights proportional to the volume
