Thought: Synthesize Price, Volume, and Intraday Dynamics for Alpha Factor Generation
- Thought: Analyze Prices for Momentum and Trends
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close (Price Momentum)
  - Sub-Thought: Determine if today's price crossed above or below a moving average of the close prices (Moving Average Crossover)
- Thought: Use Volume to Identify Market Sentiment
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the past n days (Volume Spike Indicator)
  - Sub-Thought: Assess if there is a significant increase in volume with a price increase (Volume-Price Confirmation)
- Thought: Evaluate Open and Close Prices for Gaps
  - Sub-Thought: Measure the gap between today's open and yesterday's close (Gap Analysis)
  - Sub-Thought: Check if the gap was filled during the day by comparing the open and close prices (Gap Fill Indicator)
- Thought: Combine Indicators for a Single Alpha Factor
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate Price Momentum, Moving Average Crossover, Volume Spike, and Gap Fill Indicator into a single score (Composite Alpha Factor)
  - Sub-Thought: Assign weights to each component based on their historical performance (Weighted Composite Alpha Factor)
- Thought: Integrated and Enhanced Momentum, VWAP, Intraday Dynamics, and Stochastic Influence
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate 5-Period Moving Average of Price Momentum
    - Sub-Thought: Sum of 5 consecutive 1-Period Returns, then divide by 5
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Sub-Thought: Aggregate (High + Low) / 2 * Volume, then divide by Total Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Combine Daily Momentum and VWAP-Close Difference
    - Sub-Thought: Multiply Daily Momentum by (VWAP - Close)
  - Sub-Thought: Confirm with Volume
    - Sub-Thought: Multiply combined factor by log(Volume Change + 1)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
    - Sub-Thought: High - Low
  - Sub-Thought: Compute M-day Average of N-day Close Price Percent Change
    - Sub-Thought: Use computed N-day Percent Change, choose M (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
  - Sub-Thought: Adjust with Smoothed Volume
    - Sub-Thought: Use EMA on Volume, choose EMA span (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Reversal
    - Sub-Thought: (Close - Open) - (Previous Day's Close - Open)
  - Sub-Thought: Introduce Intraday Range Volatility
    - Sub-Thought: P-day Standard Deviation of (High - Low)
  - Sub-Thought: Synthesize All Factors
    - Sub-Thought: Combine all confirmation steps
    - Sub-Thought: Incorporate Intraday Reversal and Intraday Range Volatility
      - Sub-Thought: Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Intraday Reversal
      - Sub-Thought: Combine Multiplicatively with Intraday Range Volatility
    - Sub-Thought: Integrate with Stochastic Oscillator
      - Sub-Thought: %K Line: (Close_t - Low_14) / (High_14 - Low_14)
      - Sub-Thought: %D Line: 3-period SMA of %K Line
      - Sub-Thought: Final Alpha Factor
        - Sub-Thought: Combine all synthesized factors
        - Sub-Thought: Apply sign of Volume Change as a final confirmation
