Thought: Synthesize Price Patterns, Volume Indicators, and Intraday Dynamics for Enhanced Alpha Generation
- Thought: Analyze High, Low, and Close Prices for Momentum Signals
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close (Price Momentum)
  - Sub-Thought: Determine if today's price crossed above or below a moving average of the close prices (Moving Average Crossover)
  - Sub-Thought: Compute 5-Period Moving Average of Price Momentum
    - Compute 1-Period Return using Close price
    - Shift Close price by 1 period
    - Sum of 5 consecutive 1-Period Returns, then divide by 5
- Thought: Use Volume Data to Identify Interest and Market Sentiment
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the past n days (Volume Spike Indicator)
  - Sub-Thought: Assess if there is a significant increase in volume with a price increase (Volume-Price Confirmation)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume Change
    - Use Volume
    - Shift Volume by 1 period
    - Subtract shifted Volume from current Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Apply Volume Confirmation
    - Multiply combined factor by log of (Volume Change + 1)
- Thought: Evaluate Open and Close Prices for Gap Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: Measure the gap between today's open and yesterday's close (Gap Analysis)
  - Sub-Thought: Check if the gap was filled during the day by comparing the open and close prices (Gap Fill Indicator)
- Thought: Combine Multiple Indicators for a Comprehensive Alpha Factor
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate Price Momentum, Moving Average Crossover, Volume Spike, and Gap Fill Indicator into a single score (Composite Alpha Factor)
  - Sub-Thought: Assign weights to each component based on their historical performance in predicting future returns (Weighted Composite Alpha Factor)
  - Sub-Thought: Monitor the robustness of the factor over different market conditions and adjust as necessary (Factor Robustness Testing)
- Thought: Incorporate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and Intraday Dynamics
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate VWAP
    - Aggregate (High + Low) / 2 * Volume
    - Divide Aggregated (High + Low) / 2 * Volume by Total Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Combine Daily Momentum and VWAP-Close Difference
    - Calculate VWAP to Close Difference
      - Subtract VWAP from Close price
    - Multiply Daily Momentum by VWAP-Close Difference
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
    - Use High price
    - Subtract Low price
  - Sub-Thought: Combine Intraday High-Low Spread and Momentum
    - Multiply Intraday High-Low Spread by 5-Period Moving Average of Price Momentum
    - Adjust with Volume
      - Compute Volume Weight
        - Use Volume
        - Choose a lag (e.g., 1, 2, 5)
      - Smooth Volume Weight
        - Use Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on Volume Weight
        - Choose EMA span (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Reversal
    - Use Close price
    - Use Open price
    - Subtract Previous Day's Close-Open Difference
  - Sub-Thought: Introduce Intraday Range Volatility
    - Calculate Intraday Range
      - Use High price
      - Use Low price
    - Compute P-day Standard Deviation of Intraday Range
      - Use Intraday Range
      - Choose P (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
  - Sub-Thought: Synthesize All Factors
    - Combine all confirmation steps
    - Incorporate Intraday Reversal and Intraday Range Volatility
      - Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Intraday Reversal
      - Combine Multiplicatively
        - Use result from previous step
        - Use Intraday Range Volatility
- Thought: Calculate Enhanced Raw Momentum
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Raw Momentum
    - Day t Close
    - Day t-20 Close
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate High-Low Range
    - Use High price
    - Use Low price
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate True Range
    - Max of (Day t High - Day t Low, |Day t High - Day t-1 Close|, |Day t Low - Day t-1 Close|)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Price Volatility
    - Sum of Squared Log Returns from Day t-19 to Day t
      - ln(Day t-19 Close / Day t-20 Close)
      - ln(D
