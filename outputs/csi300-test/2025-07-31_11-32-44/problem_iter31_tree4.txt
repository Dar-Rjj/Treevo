Thought: Analyze historical price and volume data to identify momentum and volatility patterns as potential alpha factors.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the moving average of closing prices over a short period (e.g., 5 days) to capture recent price trends.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Subtract the current closing price from the short-term moving average to generate a momentum signal.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: If the difference is positive, it indicates an upward trend; if negative, a downward trend.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the moving average of closing prices over a long period (e.g., 20 days) to capture longer-term price trends.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Compare the short-term and long-term moving averages to determine the strength of the trend.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: A short-term moving average above the long-term moving average suggests a strong upward trend; below, a strong downward trend.
    Sub-Thought: Measure the standard deviation of daily returns over a specific period (e.g., 10 days) to assess volatility.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Use the standard deviation as a measure of risk or uncertainty in the stock's price movements.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Higher volatility may indicate higher potential for large price swings, which can be an alpha factor.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of the current closing price to the 52-week high to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: A ratio close to 1 indicates the stock is near its 52-week high, suggesting it might be overbought.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: A low ratio suggests the stock is far from its 52-week high, indicating it might be oversold.
    Sub-Thought: Compute the on-balance volume (OBV) to track buying and selling pressure.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: If the OBV is increasing while the price is flat or declining, it suggests accumulation by informed investors.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: If the OBV is decreasing while the price is flat or increasing, it suggests distribution by informed investors.
