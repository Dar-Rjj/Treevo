Integrated and Enhanced Momentum, VWAP, Intraday Dynamics, and Stochastic Influence with Multi-Level Confirmation and Reversal
├── Calculate Daily Momentum
│   └── (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
├── Calculate 5-Period Moving Average of Price Momentum
│   └── Sum of 5 consecutive 1-Period Returns, then divide by 5
├── Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
│   └── Aggregate (High + Low) / 2 * Volume, then divide by Total Volume
├── Combine Daily Momentum and VWAP-Close Difference
│   └── Multiply Daily Momentum by (VWAP - Close)
├── Confirm with Volume
│   └── Multiply combined factor by log(Volume Change + 1)
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   └── High - Low
├── Compute M-day Average of N-day Close Price Percent Change
│   └── Use computed N-day Percent Change, choose M (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
├── Combine Intraday High-Low Spread and Momentum
│   ├── Multiply Intraday High-Low Spread by M-day Average of N-day Close Price Percent Change
│   └── Adjust with Smoothed Volume
│       └── Use EMA on Volume, choose EMA span (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
├── Calculate Intraday Reversal
│   └── (Close - Open) - (Previous Day's Close - Open)
├── Introduce Intraday Range Volatility
│   └── P-day Standard Deviation of (High - Low)
├── Synthesize All Factors
│   ├── Combine all confirmation steps
│   └── Incorporate Intraday Reversal and Intraday Range Volatility
│       ├── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Intraday Reversal
│       └── Combine Multiplicatively with Intraday Range Volatility
└── Integrate with Stochastic Oscillator
    ├── %K Line: (Close_t - Low_14) / (High_14 - Low_14)
    ├── %D Line: 3-period SMA of %K Line
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── Combine all synthesized factors
        └── Apply sign of Volume Change as a final confirmation
        └── Add Long-Term Trend Indicator
            └── 100-Period Moving Average of Close Prices
                └── Multiply by Final Alpha Factor
