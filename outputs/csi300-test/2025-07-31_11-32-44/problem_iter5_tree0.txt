Integrated Alpha Factor: Price and Volume Momentum with Intraday Adjustment
├── Calculate Enhanced Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute N-day Close Price Percent Change
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Choose N (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
│   └── Compute M-day Exponential Moving Average of N-day Close Price Percent Change
│       ├── Use computed N-day Percent Change
│       └── Choose M (e.g., 5, 10, 21) for EMA smoothing factor
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Intraday Return
│   ├── Compute Intraday Return
│   │   └── Compute (High - Low) / Low
│   └── Weight by Volume to Capture Interest
│       ├── Use Volume
│       └── Divide Intraday Return by Volume
├── Combine Enhanced Price Momentum and Volume Adjusted Intraday Return
│   └── Multiply Enhanced Price Momentum by Volume Adjusted Intraday Return
└── Integrate with Trend Continuity and Filter
    ├── Multiply by Sign of (Today's Close - Previous Day's Close)
    └── Introduce a threshold to filter out low signal-to-noise ratio
        ├── If the absolute value of the combined factor is below a threshold (e.g., 0.5), set it to zero
        └── Otherwise, use the product as the alpha factor
