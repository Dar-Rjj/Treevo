Cumulative Momentum Impact Factor
├── Calculate Daily Momentum
│   └── Compute as (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
├── Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
│   ├── Aggregate (High + Low) / 2 * Volume
│   │   └── Multiply (High + Low) / 2 by Volume for each day
│   └── Divide Aggregated (High + Low) / 2 * Volume by Total Volume
└── Combine Momentum and VWAP-Close Difference
    ├── Subtract VWAP from Close price to get VWAP-Close Difference
    └── Multiply Daily Momentum by VWAP-Close Difference
