- Technical Indicators Based Factors
  - Moving Averages
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices over 5, 10, 20, and 50 days
      - SMA difference between 5 and 10 days
      - SMA difference between 10 and 20 days
      - SMA difference between 20 and 50 days
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices over 5, 10, 20, and 50 days
      - EMA difference between 5 and 10 days
      - EMA difference between 10 and 20 days
      - EMA difference between 20 and 50 days
  - Momentum Indicators
    - Rate of Change (ROC) of Close Prices over 12 and 26 days
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Close Prices with lookback periods of 14 and 28 days
  - Volatility Indicators
    - Average True Range (ATR) based on High, Low, and Close Prices over 14 and 28 days
- Volume Indicators Based Factors
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV) calculated from Close Price and Volume
  - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) with period 20 using High, Low, Close, and Volume
- Combined Factors
  - Combine SMA and Volume: Difference in SMA(50) and CMF(20)
  - Combine Momentum and Volatility: ROC(12) divided by ATR(14)
  - Combine RSI and OBV: Subtract OBV from RSI(14)
- Price Pattern Indicators
  - Bullish/Bearish Engulfing Patterns identified through Open, High, Low, and Close Prices
  - Morning/Evening Star Patterns identified through Open, High, Low, and Close Prices
- Trend Reversal Signals
  - Bearish Divergence: When Close Price makes a higher high but RSI(14) does not
  - Bullish Divergence: When Close Price makes a lower low but RSI(14) does not
- Custom Composite Factors
  - Composite Alpha 1: [SMA(5)-SMA(10)] / ATR(14)
  - Composite Alpha 2: ROC(12) * OBV / EMA(20)
