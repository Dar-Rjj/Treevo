Thought: Develop a comprehensive set of alpha factors based on price and volume data to predict future stock returns
    Thought: Calculate the difference between close and open prices as an initial indicator of market sentiment
        Thought: Introduce a factor that measures the strength of market sentiment by comparing the absolute value of the closing-open difference with the average daily trading range (high-low)
            Thought: Enhance this factor by integrating the volume; divide the sentiment strength by the average daily volume to capture the intensity of market participation in the price movement
    Thought: Explore the relationship between intraday high/low and closing/opening prices to identify potential breakout or consolidation patterns
        Thought: Create a factor based on the proportion of days where the closing price is outside the previous day's high-low range, indicating a breakout
            Thought: Further refine this factor by considering the direction of the breakout (upward or downward) and the associated volume
        Thought: Design a factor that evaluates whether the stock is consolidating or trending by comparing the distance between the high and low for the current day with the previous day
            Thought: Add a sub-factor that checks if the consolidation or trend is accompanied by a decrease in volume, potentially signaling a period of indecision or accumulation/distribution
    Thought: Leverage the amount data to construct indicators of buying/selling pressure
        Thought: Construct a factor that measures the ratio of the amount of money flowing into the stock (buying) versus out (selling) over a certain period
            Thought: For a more nuanced measure, calculate the difference between the buying and selling pressure on days when the stock closes above its opening price compared to days it closes below
                Thought: Integrate this measure with the overall trend of the stock, possibly using a moving average of the close price, to create a momentum-based factor
    Thought: Analyze the interaction between price and volume to detect unusual activity
        Thought: Develop a factor that flags significant changes in volume relative to the price movement, suggesting possible insider information or major external events
            Thought: Enhance this by categorizing the abnormal volume-price actions into different classes (e.g., high volume with minimal price change, sudden spikes in both volume and price) to better understand the type of market activity
