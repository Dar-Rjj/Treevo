Enhanced Intraday and Cumulative Momentum Factor
├── Calculate Daily Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Compute as (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
├── Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
│   ├── Aggregate Volume
│   │   ├── Sum volumes over a period
│   ├── Aggregate (High + Low) / 2 * Volume
│   │   ├── Multiply (High + Low) / 2 by Volume for each day
│   └── Divide Aggregated (High + Low) / 2 * Volume by Total Volume
├── Calculate VWAP to Close Ratio
│   ├── Divide VWAP by Close price
│   └── Use Result as VWAP-Close Ratio
├── Combine Momentum and VWAP-Close Ratio
│   ├── Multiply Daily Momentum by VWAP-Close Ratio
│   └── Use Result as Combined Momentum-VWAP Factor
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│   └── Compute as (High_t - Low_t) / Low_t
├── Calculate Intraday Reversal
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Use Open price
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close-Open Difference
├── Synthesize Enhanced Intraday and Cumulative Momentum Factor
│   ├── Combine Combined Momentum-VWAP Factor with Intraday Reversal
│   └── Use Result as the Final Alpha Factor
└── Incorporate Intraday High-Low Spread
    ├── Multiply Final Alpha Factor by Intraday High-Low Spread
    └── Use Result as the Enhanced Final Alpha Factor
