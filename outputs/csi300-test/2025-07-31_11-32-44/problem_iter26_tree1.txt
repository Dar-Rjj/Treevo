Thought: Synthesize Price Patterns, Volume Indicators, and Intraday Dynamics for Alpha Generation
- Thought: Analyze High, Low, Close, and Open Prices for Momentum Signals
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close (Price Momentum)
  - Sub-Thought: Determine if today's price crossed above or below a moving average of the close prices (Moving Average Crossover)
  - Sub-Thought: Compute 5-Period Moving Average of Price Momentum
    - Compute 1-Period Return using Close price
    - Shift Close price by 1 period
    - Sum of 5 consecutive 1-Period Returns, then divide by 5
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Reversal
    - Use Close price
    - Use Open price
    - Subtract Previous Day's Close-Open Difference
- Thought: Use Volume Data to Identify Interest and Market Sentiment
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the past n days (Volume Spike Indicator)
  - Sub-Thought: Assess if there is a significant increase in volume with a price increase (Volume-Price Confirmation)
  - Sub-Thought: Confirm with Volume
    - Calculate Volume Change
      - Use Volume
      - Shift Volume by 1 period
      - Subtract shifted Volume from current Volume
    - Apply Volume Confirmation
      - Multiply combined factor by log of (Volume Change + 1)
  - Sub-Thought: Adjust with Volume
    - Compute Volume Weight
      - Use Volume
      - Choose a lag (e.g., 1, 2, 5)
    - Smooth Volume Weight
      - Use Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on Volume Weight
      - Choose EMA span (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
- Thought: Evaluate Open and Close Prices for Gap Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: Measure the gap between today's open and yesterday's close (Gap Analysis)
  - Sub-Thought: Check if the gap was filled during the day by comparing the open and close prices (Gap Fill Indicator)
- Thought: Introduce Intraday Range and Volatility
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
    - Use High price
    - Subtract Low price
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Range Volatility
    - Calculate Intraday Range
      - Use High price
      - Use Low price
    - Compute P-day Standard Deviation of Intraday Range
      - Use Intraday Range
      - Choose P (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
- Thought: Combine Multiple Indicators for a Comprehensive Alpha Factor
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate Price Momentum, Moving Average Crossover, Volume Spike, and Gap Fill Indicator into a single score (Composite Alpha Factor)
  - Sub-Thought: Incorporate Intraday Reversal and Intraday Range Volatility
    - Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Intraday Reversal
      - Use Adjusted Momentum
      - Use Intraday Reversal
    - Combine Multiplicatively
      - Use result from previous step
      - Use Intraday Range Volatility
  - Sub-Thought: Assign weights to each component based on their historical performance in predicting future returns (Weighted Composite Alpha Factor)
  - Sub-Thought: Monitor the robustness of the factor over different market conditions and adjust as necessary (Factor Robustness Testing)
- Thought: Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
  - Aggregate (High + Low) / 2 * Volume
  - Divide Aggregated (High + Low) / 2 * Volume by Total Volume
- Thought: Combine VWAP and Close Price Dynamics
  - Calculate VWAP to Close Difference
    - Subtract VWAP from Close price
  - Multiply Daily Momentum by VWAP-Close Difference
- Thought: Synthesize All Factors
  - Combine all confirmation steps
    - Use confirmed and synthesized alpha factor
  - Add Synthesized Enhanced Intraday and Cumulative Momentum Factor
  - Apply 7-day Simple Moving Average
    - Apply 7-day SMA to the Final Integrated Result
- Thought: Final Alpha Factor
  - Combine Momentum and VWAP-Close Difference
    - Multiply Daily Momentum by VWAP-Close Difference
  - Use the final integrated and weighted composite alpha factor
