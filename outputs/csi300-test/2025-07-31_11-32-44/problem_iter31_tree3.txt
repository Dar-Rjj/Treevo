Integrated and Enhanced Momentum, VWAP, Intraday Dynamics, and Stochastic Influence with Multi-Level Confirmation and Reversal
├── Daily Momentum
│   └── (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
├── 5-Period Moving Average of Price Momentum
│   └── Sum of 5 consecutive 1-Period Returns, then divide by 5
├── Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
│   └── Aggregate (High + Low) / 2 * Volume, then divide by Total Volume
├── Combined Momentum and VWAP-Close Difference
│   └── Multiply Daily Momentum by (VWAP - Close)
├── Confirmed with Volume
│   └── Multiply combined factor by log(Volume Change + 1)
├── Intraday High-Low Spread
│   └── High - Low
├── Intraday Reversal
│   └── (Close - Open) - (Previous Day's Close - Open)
├── Intraday Range Volatility
│   └── P-day Standard Deviation of (High - Low)
└── Synthesized Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine all confirmation steps
    ├── Incorporate Intraday Reversal and Intraday Range Volatility
    │   ├── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Intraday Reversal
    │   └── Combine Multiplicatively with Intraday Range Volatility
