Price and High-Low Range Momentum with Volume Confirmation
├── Calculate N-day Close Price Percent Change
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Choose N (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
├── Calculate M-day Average of N-day Close Price Percent Change
│   ├── Use computed N-day Percent Change
│   └── Choose M (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Combine High-Low Range and Price Momentum
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Range by M-day Average of N-day Close Price Percent Change
│   └── Use the product as a combined factor
├── Calculate Volume Change
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Choose a lag (e.g., 1, 2, 5)
├── Compute Z-score of Volume Change
│   ├── Use computed Volume Change
│   └── Compute rolling standard deviation and mean
└── Confirm with Volume
    ├── Compare Current Volume with Average Volume
    │   ├── Use Current Volume
    │   └── Use Historical Volume Data to calculate Average Volume
    └── Adjust the combined factor by Z-score of Volume Change
        ├── Use the combined factor
        └── Multiply by Z-score of Volume Change
