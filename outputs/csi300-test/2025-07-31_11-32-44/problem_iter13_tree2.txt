Enhanced Price and Volume Momentum with Confirmation and Intraday Dynamics
├── Calculate Daily Momentum
│   └── Compute as (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
├── Calculate 5-Period Moving Average of Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 1-Period Return using Close price
│   │   └── Shift Close price by 1 period
│   └── Sum of 5 consecutive 1-Period Returns, then divide by 5
├── Calculate VWAP
│   ├── Multiply (High + Low) / 2 by Volume for each day
│   └── Divide Aggregated (High + Low) / 2 * Volume by Total Volume
├── Calculate VWAP to Close Difference
│   └── Subtract VWAP from Close price
├── Combine Daily Momentum and VWAP-Close Difference
│   └── Multiply Daily Momentum by VWAP-Close Difference
├── Confirm with Volume
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   └── Subtract shifted Volume from current Volume
│   └── Apply Volume Confirmation
│       └── Multiply combined factor by log of (Volume Change + 1)
├── Synthesize with Intraday Reversal
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Reversal
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close-Open Difference
│   └── Combine confirmed factor with Intraday Reversal
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Use confirmed and synthesized alpha factor
    └── Apply sign of Volume Change as a final confirmation
