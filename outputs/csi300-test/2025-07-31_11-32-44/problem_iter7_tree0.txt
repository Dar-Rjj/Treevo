│   ├── Compute N-day Close Price Percent Change (N: 5, 10, 21)
│   └── Compute M-day Exponential Moving Average of N-day Close Price Percent Change (M: 5, 10, 21)
├── Calculate Volume Reversal
│   ├── Compute Volume Change (Lag: 1, 2, 5)

└── Combine Price Momentum and Volume Reversal
    ├── Multiply Price Momentum by Volume Reversal Cumulative Z-score
    └── Apply Threshold to Filter Signal
        └── If absolute value < 0.5, set to zero; otherwise, use product as alpha factor
