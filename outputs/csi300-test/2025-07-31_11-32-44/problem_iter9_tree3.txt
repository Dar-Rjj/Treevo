Synthesized Volume and Intraday Dynamics Impact Factor
├── Calculate Daily Momentum
│   └── Compute as (Close_t - Close_(t-2)) / Close_(t-2)
├── Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
│   ├── Multiply (High + Low + Close) / 3 by Volume for each day
│   └── Divide Aggregated (High + Low + Close) / 3 * Volume by Total Volume
├── Combine Momentum and VWAP-Open Difference
│   ├── Subtract VWAP from Open price to get VWAP-Open Difference
│   └── Multiply Daily Momentum by VWAP-Open Difference
└── Incorporate Intraday Reversal
    ├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
    │   ├── Use High price
    │   └── Use Low price
    │       └── Compute High-Low Spread as (High_t - Low_t)
    ├── Calculate Intraday Reversal
    │   ├── Use Close price
    │   ├── Use Open price
    │   └── Compute Intraday Reversal as (Close_t - Open_t) - (Close_(t-1) - Open_(t-1))
    └── Synthesize Final Alpha Factor
        ├── Multiply Combined Momentum-VWAP Factor by Intraday High-Low Spread
        └── Add the result to Intraday Reversal, then multiply by the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the last 5 days to get the Final Alpha Factor
