Thought: Integrated Volume, Price, and Momentum Analysis with Intraday and Trend Adjustments
├── Calculate Enhanced Raw Momentum
│   ├── Compute N-day Close Price Percent Change (N = 5)
│   └── Apply Exponential Decay Factor to N-day Momentum
│       ├── Day t Close
│       └── Day t-45 Close
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Compute (High - Low) / Close
│   └── Weight by Log of Volume
│       └── Divide Intraday Volatility by Log of Volume
├── Combine Momentum, Intraday Volatility, and High-Low Range
│   ├── Multiply Enhanced Raw Momentum by Volume-Adjusted Intraday Volatility
│   └── Multiply the result by (High - Low)
├── Confirm with Absolute Volume Delta
│   ├── Calculate Volume Delta
│   │   ├── Day t Volume
│   │   └── Day t-45 Volume
│   └── Multiply the combined factor by Absolute Volume Delta
├── Integrate with Trend Continuity and Filter
│   ├── Multiply by Sign of (Today's Close - Previous Day's Close)
│   └── Apply Threshold
│       ├── If the absolute value of the combined factor is below 0.8, set it to zero
│       └── Otherwise, use the product as the alpha factor
├── Analyze Prices for Momentum and Trends
│   ├── Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close (Price Momentum)
│   └── Determine if today's price crossed above or below a moving average of the close prices (Moving Average Crossover)
├── Use Volume to Identify Market Sentiment
│   ├── Compute the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the past n days (Volume Spike Indicator)
│   └── Assess if there is a significant increase in volume with a price increase (Volume-Price Confirmation)
├── Evaluate Open and Close Prices for Gaps
│   ├── Measure the gap between today's open and yesterday's close (Gap Analysis)
│   └── Check if the gap was filled during the day by comparing the open and close prices (Gap Fill Indicator)
└── Combine Indicators for a Single Alpha Factor
    ├── Integrate Price Momentum, Moving Average Crossover, Volume Spike, and Gap Fill Indicator into a single score (Composite Alpha Factor)
    └── Assign weights to each component based on their historical performance (Weighted Composite Alpha Factor)
