Integrated and Enhanced Momentum, VWAP, and Intraday Dynamics with Multi-Level Confirmation
├── Calculate Daily Momentum
│   └── Compute as (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
├── Calculate 5-Period Moving Average of Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 1-Period Return using Close price
│   │   └── Shift Close price by 1 period
│   └── Sum of 5 consecutive 1-Period Returns, then divide by 5
├── Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
│   ├── Aggregate (High + Low) / 2 * Volume
│   │   └── Multiply (High + Low) / 2 by Volume for each day
│   └── Divide Aggregated (High + Low) / 2 * Volume by Total Volume
├── Combine Daily Momentum and VWAP
│   └── Multiply Daily Momentum by (Close - VWAP)
├── Confirm with Volume
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   ├── Shift Volume by 1 period
│   │   └── Subtract shifted Volume from current Volume
│   └── Apply Volume Confirmation
│       └── Multiply combined factor by log of (Volume Change + 1)
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   └── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Calculate Previous Day's Intraday High-Low Spread
│   └── Subtract shifted Low price by 1 period from shifted High price by 1 period
├── Calculate Intraday Momentum
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Intraday High-Low Spread from Intraday High-Low Spread
├── Generate Alpha Factor Component
│   └── Multiply 5-Period Moving Average of Returns by sign of (Volume Change + Amount Change)
│       ├── Use sign function on (Volume Change + Amount Change)
└── Synthesize All Factors
    └── Add Intraday Momentum to the combination of confirmed and synthesized alpha factor
