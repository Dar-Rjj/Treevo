Enhanced Intraday and Cumulative Momentum Factor
├── Calculate Daily Momentum
│   └── Compute as (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
├── Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
│   ├── Aggregate (High + Low) / 2 * Volume
│   └── Divide Aggregated (High + Low) / 2 * Volume by Total Volume
├── Calculate VWAP to Close Difference
│   └── Subtract VWAP from Close price
├── Combine Momentum and VWAP-Close Difference
│   └── Multiply Daily Momentum by VWAP-Close Difference
├── Calculate Intraday Reversal
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close-Open Difference
└── Synthesize Enhanced Intraday and Cumulative Momentum Factor
    └── Add Combined Momentum-VWAP Factor and Intraday Reversal
