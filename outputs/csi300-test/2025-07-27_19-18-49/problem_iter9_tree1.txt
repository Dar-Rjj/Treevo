Enhanced Price and Volume Momentum with Open-Price Integration and High-Low Band Analysis
├── Calculate Integrated Price Momentum
│   ├── Calculate integrated momentum as (Close - Open) / Open + (Close - Close 1 day ago) / Close 1 day ago
│   └── Aggregate over the last 5 days: Sum of daily integrated momentums / 5
├── Calculate Volume Momentum
│   ├── Calculate volume change as (Volume - Volume 1 day ago) / Volume 1 day ago
│   └── Aggregate over the last 5 days: Sum of daily volume changes / 5
├── Calculate High-Low Band Momentum
│   ├── Calculate high-low band as (High - Low) / Low
│   └── Aggregate over the last 5 days: Sum of daily high-low bands / 5
└── Combine Momentum Factors
    └── Multiply Integrated Price Momentum by Volume Momentum and High-Low Band Momentum
