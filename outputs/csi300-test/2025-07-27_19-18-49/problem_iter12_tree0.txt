Price and Volume Integration with Advanced Oscillators
├── Calculate 5-Day Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Calculate momentum as (Close - Close 1 day ago) / Close 1 day ago
│   └── Average over the last 5 days
├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Momentum
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Calculate volume change as (Volume - Volume 1 day ago) / Volume 1 day ago
│   └── Average over the last 5 days
├── Calculate 5-Day Price Range
│   ├── Use High and Low prices
│   │   └── Calculate price range as (High - Low)
│   └── Average over the last 5 days
├── Calculate 5-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI)
│   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Calculate daily price change as (Close - Close 1 day ago)
│   ├── Calculate average gain and average loss over the last 5 days
│   │   ├── Average gain: Sum of positive changes / 5
│   │   └── Average loss: Absolute sum of negative changes / 5
│   ├── Calculate relative strength (RS) as (Average gain / Average loss)
│   └── Calculate RSI as 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
└── Combine Price, Volume, Price Range, and RSI
    ├── Multiply 5-Day Price Momentum by 5-Day Volume Momentum
    ├── Multiply the result by 5-Day Price Range
    ├── Multiply the result by 5-Day RSI
    └── Use the final result as the alpha factor
