Integrated Price, Volume and Close Momentum with Open-Price Integration and Price Oscillation
├── Calculate Integrated Price Momentum
│   ├── Integrated momentum as (Close - Open) / Open + (Close - Close 1 day ago) / Close 1 day ago
│   └── Aggregate: Sum of daily integrated momentums over last 5 days / 5
├── Calculate 5-Day Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Momentum as (Close - Close 1 day ago) / Close 1 day ago
│   └── Aggregate: Sum of daily momentums over last 5 days / 5
├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Momentum
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Volume change as (Volume - Volume 1 day ago) / Volume 1 day ago
│   └── Aggregate: Sum of daily volume changes over last 5 days / 5
├── Calculate 5-Day Price Oscillation
│   ├── Use High and Low prices
│   │   └── Price range as (High - Low)
│   └── Aggregate: Sum of daily price ranges over last 5 days / 5
└── Combine All Factors
    ├── Multiply Integrated Price Momentum by 5-Day Price Momentum
    ├── Multiply the result by 5-Day Volume Momentum
    ├── Multiply the result by 5-Day Price Oscillation
    └── Use the final result as the alpha factor
