Improved Alpha Mining Thought Tree Combining Price and Volume Dynamics
├── Calculate Daily Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Compute the difference between t and t-10
├── Calculate Volume Surprise
│   ├── Compute 10-day moving average of volume
│   └── Subtract the moving average from the current volume
├── Combine Price Momentum and Volume Surprise
│   └── Multiply Price Momentum by Volume Surprise
├── Calculate High-Low Price Difference
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Compute Volume Influence Ratio
│   ├── Sum volume on Upward Days (Close > Open)
│   ├── Sum volume on Downward Days (Close < Open)
│   └── Divide Upward Volume by Downward Volume
├── Intermediate Alpha Factor Synthesis
│   └── Multiply combined Price Momentum and Volume Surprise by High-Low Price Difference
└── Final Alpha Factor
    └── Multiply Intermediate Alpha Factor by Volume Influence Ratio
        └── Output as the final alpha factor
