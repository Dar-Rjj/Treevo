Synthesized Alpha Factor from Intraday Dynamics, Momentum, and Volume Influence
├── Calculate Adjusted Price Momentum
│   ├── Calculate price difference between current close and previous low
│   └── Smooth the adjusted momentum with EMA (define EMA smoothing factor)
├── Combine Adjusted Momentum and Simple Price Momentum
│   ├── Calculate Simple Price Momentum
│   │   ├── Define lookback period
│   │   └── Calculate price difference between current close and previous close
│   │       └── Smooth with EMA
│   └── Sum the smoothed adjusted momentum and simple price momentum
├── Adjust by Volume Change
│   ├── Calculate Volume Ratio
│   │   ├── Calculate volume ratio between current day and 5-day moving average of volume
│   │   └── Smooth with SMA (define SMA length)
│   └── Multiply combined momentum by smoothed volume ratio
├── Compute Volume Influence Ratio
│   ├── Accumulate Volume on Upward Days: Sum volume if Close > Open
│   ├── Accumulate Volume on Downward Days: Sum volume if Close < Open
│   └── Divide Upward Volume by Downward Volume
├── Integrate Combined Momentum, Volume Ratio, and Directional Volume Impact
│   └── Multiply by the square root of the Volume Influence Ratio
├── Calculate Adjusted Intraday Reversal
│   ├── Compute Intraday Reversal: 2 * (High - Low) / (Close + Open)
│   └── Adjust for Momentum: (1 + (Close_t - Close_{t-10}) / Close_{t-10})
├── Generate Preliminary Alpha Factor
│   ├── Multiply Adjusted Intraday Reversal by combined momentum and volume ratio
│   └── Add Day-to-Day Open Price Change: (Open_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
├── Calculate Daily Volume Surprise
│   ├── Compute 10-day moving average of volume
│   └── Subtract the moving average from the current volume
├── Combine Price Momentum and Volume Surprise
│   ├── Compute the difference between t and t-10 for Close price
│   └── Multiply Price Momentum by Volume Surprise
└── Final Alpha Factor
    └── Multiply Preliminary Alpha Factor by combined Price Momentum and Volume Surprise and Volume Influence Ratio
