Synthesized Alpha Mining Thought Tree Integrating Price, Volume, and Momentum Dynamics
├── Compute Intraday Reversal: 2 * (High - Low) / (Close + Open)
├── Adjust for Short-Term Momentum: 1 + (Close_t - Close_{t-5}) / Close_{t-5}
├── Calculate Close to Midpoint Deviation: Close - (High + Low) / 2
├── Generate Preliminary Alpha Factor
│   ├── Multiply Intraday Reversal by Short-Term Momentum Adjustment
│   └── Add Day-to-Day High Price Change: (High_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
├── Calculate Daily Volume Surprise
│   ├── Compute 5-day moving average of volume
│   └── Subtract the moving average from the current volume
├── Combine Price Momentum and Volume Surprise
│   ├── Compute the difference between t and t-5 for Close price
│   └── Multiply Price Momentum by Volume Surprise
├── Compute Volume Influence Ratio
│   ├── Accumulate Volume on Upward Days: Sum volume if Close > Open
│   ├── Accumulate Volume on Downward Days: Sum volume if Close < Open
│   └── Divide Upward Volume by Downward Volume
├── Incorporate Trading Amount Trends
│   ├── Compute 5-day moving average of amount
│   └── Subtract the moving average from the current amount
├── Integrate Trading Amount and Price Movements
│   ├── Compute the difference between t and t-5 for Close price
│   └── Multiply Price Difference by Trading Amount Trend
└── Final Alpha Factor
    └── Multiply Preliminary Alpha Factor by combined Price Momentum and Volume Surprise, Volume Influence Ratio, and Integrated Trading Amount and Price Movements
