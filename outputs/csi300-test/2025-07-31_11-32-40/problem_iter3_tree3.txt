Enhanced Price and Volume Dynamics Alpha
├── Calculate Weighted Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   ├── Compute the weighted sum of close price change over the last 10 days
│   │   └── Weights: 1,2,3,...,10 for day t-1 to t-10 respectively
│   └── Adjust by average volume over the period
├── Revisiting Volume Surprise
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Compute 10-day exponential moving average of volume
│   ├── Subtract the EMA from the current volume
│   └── Square the result to emphasize large deviations
└── Integrating Price and Volume Signals
    ├── Divide Weighted Price Momentum by modified Volume Surprise
    └── Output as the final alpha factor
