Thought: Construct alpha factors using basic OHLCV data
- Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average of closing prices over a 10-day window
-- Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the current day's close and its 10-day moving average
--- Sub-thought: Use this difference as an indicator of momentum or trend
- Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of the highest high to the lowest low within the last 20 trading days
-- Sub-thought: This factor can signify the stock's volatility in the recent period
- Sub-thought: Explore the relationship between volume and price change
-- Sub-thought: Calculate the correlation coefficient between daily volume changes and price percentage changes for the last 30 days
--- Sub-thought: A positive correlation might indicate that buying (or selling) pressure is driving the price, while a lack of correlation might suggest other factors are influencing the price
- Sub-thought: Analyze patterns in the opening and closing prices
-- Sub-thought: Count the number of days, over the last 50, where the open was higher than the close, potentially indicating a bearish sentiment
-- Sub-thought: Compare this count with the opposite scenario (open lower than close) to gauge overall market sentiment towards the stock
- Sub-thought: Investigate the impact of large transactions on future returns
-- Sub-thought: Identify days where the volume traded is at least 2 standard deviations above the mean volume calculated over the past year
--- Sub-thought: For each such day, calculate the return from the next day's open to the close 10 days later, averaging these returns for all identified days
