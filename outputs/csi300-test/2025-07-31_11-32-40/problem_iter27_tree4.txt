Crossover Thought Tree for Alpha Mining Integrating Intraday Dynamics, Momentum, and Volume Influence
├── Compute Adjusted Intraday Reversal
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Reversal: 2 * (High - Low) / (Close + Open)
│   └── Adjust for Momentum and Volume Change: (1 + (Close_t - Close_{t-10}) / Close_{t-10}) * (1 + (Volume_t - Volume_{t-5}) / Volume_{t-5})
├── Calculate Close to Midpoint Deviation
│   ├── Compute Intraday Midpoint: (High + Low) / 2
│   └── Subtract Midpoint from Close
├── Generate Day-to-Day Open Price Change
│   └── Compute: (Open_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
├── Combine Intraday Reversal, Close to Midpoint Deviation, and Open Price Change
│   ├── Multiply Adjusted Intraday Reversal by Close to Midpoint Deviation
│   └── Add Day-to-Day Open Price Change
├── Calculate Daily Volume Surprise
│   ├── Compute 5-day moving average of volume
│   └── Subtract the moving average from the current volume
├── Compute Volume Influence Ratio
│   ├── Accumulate Volume on Upward Days: Sum volume if Close > Open
│   ├── Accumulate Volume on Downward Days: Sum volume if Close < Open
│   └── Divide Upward Volume by Downward Volume
├── Calculate Smoothed Price Momentum
│   ├── Define lookback period as 20 days
│   └── Calculate price difference between current close and previous close
│       └── Smooth with EMA
├── Adjust by Smoothed Volume Change
