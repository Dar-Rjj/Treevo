Volume-Weighted Intraday Reversal and Price Momentum Alpha
├── Calculate Intraday Reversal
│   ├── Compute as 2 * (High - Low) / (Close + Open)
├── Adjust for Open Interest
│   └── Multiply Intraday Reversal by (1 + (Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}) / Volume_{t-1})
├── Consider Day-to-Day Open Price Change
│   └── Compute as (Open_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
├── Combine Reversal and Open Interest Adjustments
│   ├── Multiply Intraday Reversal by Open Interest Adjustment
│   └── Add Day-to-Day Open Price Change
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close prices
│   │   └── Calculate price difference between current close and previous close
│   └── Smooth the momentum with Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
│       └── Define EMA smoothing factor
├── Adjust by Volume Change
│   ├── Calculate Volume Ratio
│   │   └── Calculate volume ratio between current day and previous day
│   └── Smooth the volume ratio with Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│       └── Define SMA length
│   └── Multiply the smoothed price momentum by the smoothed volume ratio
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Weight Intraday Reversal Adjustments
    ├── Weight Price Momentum Adjustments
    └── Sum the weighted adjustments
