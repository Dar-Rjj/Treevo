Synthesize Enhanced Alpha Factor from Intraday Dynamics, Volume Momentum, and Price Reversal Indicators
├── Calculate High-Low Price Difference
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Compute Volume Influence Ratio
│   ├── Sum volume on Upward Days (Close > Open)
│   └── Sum volume on Downward Days (Close < Open)
│   └── Divide Upward Volume by Downward Volume
├── Multiply High-Low Difference with Volume Influence Ratio
│   ├── Use High-Low Price Difference
│   └── Use Volume Influence Ratio
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Use Open price
│       ├── Subtract Open from Close
│       └── Divide by Open
├── Identify Volume Momentum
│   ├── Calculate 10-day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   ├── Accumulate 10-day Volume
│   │   └── Divide by 10
│   ├── Calculate Daily Volume Change
│   │   ├── Subtract moving average from current day's Volume
│   │   └── Determine if positive or negative
│   └── Assign Volume Momentum Strength
│       ├── If Daily Volume Change is positive, assign higher momentum strength
│       └── If Daily Volume Change is negative, assign lower momentum strength
├── Combine High-Low Difference, Volume Influence, and Intraday Return
│   ├── Multiply (High-Low Difference * Volume Influence Ratio) with Intraday Return
│   └── Then multiply the result by Volume Momentum Strength
├── Calculate Daily Price Reversal
│   ├── Use Close price
│   ├── Compute the difference between t and t-1
│   └── Reverse the sign if the previous day's return was positive
├── Calculate Volume Surprise
│   ├── Compute 10-day moving average of volume
│   ├── Subtract the moving average from the current volume
│   └── Multiply Price Reversal by Volume Surprise
├── Integrate Short-Term Price Volatility
│   ├── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Compute mean of 5-day Close prices
│   │   ├── Compute squared differences from the mean
│   │   └── Take the square root of the average of squared differences
│   └── Adjust Final Alpha Factor
│       ├── Use combined Price Reversal and Volume Surprise
│       ├── Use Combined High-Low Difference, Volume Influence, and Intraday Return
│       └── Multiply the two combined factors
│           └── Divide the result by the 5-day Standard Deviation of Close Prices
└── Introduce New Factor: Momentum of Intraday Range
    ├── Calculate 5-day Moving Average of Intraday Range
    │   ├── Accumulate 5-day High-Low Price Difference
    │   └── Divide by 5
    ├── Calculate Daily Intraday Range Change
    │   ├── Subtract moving average from current day's High-Low Price Difference
    │   └── Determine if positive or negative
    └── Assign Intraday Range Momentum Strength
        ├── If Daily Intraday Range Change is positive, assign higher momentum strength
        └── If Daily Intraday Range Change is negative, assign lower momentum strength
└── Synthesize Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Use adjusted combined factors
    ├── Use Intraday Range Momentum Strength
    └── Output as the final alpha factor
