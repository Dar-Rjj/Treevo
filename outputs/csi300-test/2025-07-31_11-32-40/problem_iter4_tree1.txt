│       ├── Define EMA smoothing factor
└── Adjust by Volume Change
    ├── Calculate Volume Ratio
    │   ├── Define lookback period for volume
    │   └── Calculate volume ratio between current day and previous day
    └── Smooth the volume ratio with Simple Moving Average (SMA)
        ├── Define SMA length
    └── Combine Momentum and Volume Ratio
        ├── Multiply the smoothed price momentum by the smoothed volume ratio
