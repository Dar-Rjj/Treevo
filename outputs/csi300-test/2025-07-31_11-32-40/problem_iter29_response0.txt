```python
import pandas as pd

def heuristics_v2(df):
    """
    This function computes a novel and interpretable alpha factor based on the provided market features.
    
    The alpha factor is calculated as follows:
    1. Compute the difference between the high and low price for the day (intraday range).
    2. Calculate the percentage change in closing price from the previous day.
    3. Compute the ratio of the current volume to the 20-day moving average of volume.
    4. Combine these three components into a single factor, where:
        - A large intraday range suggests higher volatility.
        - A positive percentage change in closing price indicates momentum.
        - A high volume relative to the moving average suggests increased interest.
    
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with columns ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'amount', 'volume'] indexed by date.
    
    Returns:
    pd.Series: Series with the computed alpha factor indexed by date.
