Synthesized Alpha Mining Thought Tree from Price, Volume, and Intraday Dynamics
├── Calculate Adjusted Price Momentum
│   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices
│   │   └── Calculate price difference between current close and previous low
│   └── Smooth the adjusted momentum with Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
│       └── Define EMA smoothing factor
├── Calculate Simple Price Momentum
│   ├── Define lookback period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Compute the difference between t and t-10 using Close price
├── Combine Adjusted and Simple Momentum
│   └── Sum the smoothed adjusted momentum and simple price momentum
├── Calculate Volume Surprise
│   ├── Use Volume
