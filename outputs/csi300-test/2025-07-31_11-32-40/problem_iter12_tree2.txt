Adjusted Price Momentum and Volume Impact Alpha
├── Calculate Adjusted Price Momentum
│   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices
│   │   └── Calculate price difference between current close and previous low
│   └── Smooth the adjusted momentum with Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
│       └── Define EMA smoothing factor
├── Adjust by Volume Change
│   ├── Calculate Volume Ratio
│   │   └── Calculate volume ratio between current day and 5-day moving average of volume
│   └── Smooth the volume ratio with Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│       └── Define SMA length
├── Combine Adjusted Momentum and Volume Ratio
│   └── Multiply the smoothed adjusted momentum by the smoothed volume ratio
├── Compute Volume Influence Ratio
│   ├── Accumulate Volume on Upward Days
│   │   └── Sum volume if Close > Open
│   ├── Accumulate Volume on Downward Days
│   │   └── Sum volume if Close < Open
│   └── Divide Upward Volume by Downward Volume
└── Integrate Combined Adjusted Momentum, Volume Ratio, and Directional Volume Impact
    └── Multiply by the square root of the Volume Influence Ratio
