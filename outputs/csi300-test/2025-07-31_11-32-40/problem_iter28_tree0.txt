Synthesize Enhanced Alpha Factor from Intraday Dynamics, Volume Momentum, and Price Reversal Indicators
├── Calculate High-Low Price Difference
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Compute Volume Influence Ratio
│   ├── Sum volume on days where Close > Open
│   ├── Sum volume on days where Close < Open
│   └── Divide Upward Volume by Downward Volume
├── Multiply High-Low Difference with Volume Influence Ratio
│   ├── Use High-Low Price Difference
│   └── Use Volume Influence Ratio
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   ├── Subtract Open from Close, then divide by Open
├── Combine High-Low Difference, Volume Influence, and Intraday Return
│   ├── Multiply (High-Low Difference * Volume Influence Ratio) with Intraday Return
├── Calculate Daily Price Reversal
│   ├── Compute the difference between t and t-1 Close prices
│   └── Reverse the sign if the previous day's return was positive
│       ├── If t-1 Close > t-2 Close, reverse the sign
├── Integrate Short-Term Price Volatility
│   ├── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Close Prices
│   └── Adjust Final Alpha Factor
│       ├── Use combined (High-Low Difference, Volume Influence, Intraday Return)
│       └── Multiply the result by Daily Price Reversal, then divide by 5-day Standard Deviation
├── Incorporate Trend Strength
│   ├── Calculate 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
│   ├── Calculate 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
│   ├── Determine Trend Direction
│   │   ├── If 10-day SMA > 30-day SMA, trend is up
│   │   └── If 10-day SMA < 30-day SMA, trend is down
│   └── Enhance Final Alpha Factor
│       ├── Use Final Alpha Factor
│       └── Multiply by a trend adjustment factor
│           └── If trend is up, use a positive adjustment factor
│               └── If trend is down, use a negative adjustment factor
└── Synthesize Final Alpha Factor
    └── Output as the final alpha factor
