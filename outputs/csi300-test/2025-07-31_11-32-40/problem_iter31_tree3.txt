Crossover of Intraday Reversal, Momentum, and Volume Influence with Price, Volume, and Momentum Dynamics
├── Calculate Adjusted Intraday Reversal
│   ├── Compute Intraday Reversal: 2 * (High - Low) / (Close + Open)
│   └── Adjust for Momentum: (1 + (Close_t - Close_{t-5}) / Close_{t-5})
├── Calculate Close to Midpoint Deviation
│   ├── Compute Intraday Midpoint: (High + Low) / 2
│   └── Subtract Midpoint from Close
