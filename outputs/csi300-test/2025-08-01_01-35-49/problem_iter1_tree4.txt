Relative Strength Index Adjusted by Volume and Amount
├── Calculate Daily Returns
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Previous Close from Current Close
├── Compute Upward and Downward Movements
│   ├── Upward Movement
│   │   ├── If Daily Return > 0
│   │   └── Use the Daily Return
│   └── Downward Movement
│       ├── If Daily Return < 0
│       └── Use Absolute of the Daily Return
├── Smoothed Upward and Downward Movements
│   ├── Sum Upward Movement over 14 days
│   └── Sum Downward Movement over 14 days
├── Calculate Relative Strength
│   ├── Average of Smoothed Upward Movement
│   └── Divide by Average of Smoothed Downward Movement
├── Calculate RSI
│   ├── Add 1 to the Relative Strength
│   └── Divide by 2, then Multiply by 100
└── Adjust RSI by Volume and Amount
    ├── Compute Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    │   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices
    │   └── Weight by Volume
    ├── Compute Amount Weighted Average Price (AWAP)
    │   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices
    │   └── Weight by Amount
    ├── Calculate VWAP Factor
    │   ├── Subtract VWAP at t-1 from VWAP at t
    │   └── Normalize by VWAP at t-1
    ├── Calculate AWAP Factor
    │   ├── Subtract AWAP at t-1 from AWAP at t
    │   └── Normalize by AWAP at t-1
    ├── Combine VWAP and AWAP Factors
    │   ├── Add VWAP Factor and AWAP Factor
    └── Multiply Combined Factors with RSI
