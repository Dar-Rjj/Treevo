Consider incorporating market breadth, liquidity measures, and sentiment indicators for more robust alpha generation.
Incorporate market sentiment, liquidity metrics, and use adaptive smoothing for more dynamic and responsive factors.
Incorporate sector-specific momentum, use adaptive EMA, and integrate market sentiment for improved factor performance.
Integrate more sophisticated smoothing, consider liquidity, and explore alternative non-linear transformations.
Normalize long-term momentum, combine with volume-adjusted volatility, and apply non-linear transformations for enhanced predictive power.
Simplify calculations, maintain key ratios, and consider more dynamic volatility measures for better factor performance.
Incorporate market sentiment, liquidity measures, and sector-specific trends for improved predictive power.
Focus on refining smoothing, better integration of volume, and more sophisticated non-linear transformations.
