Integrate momentum, use EMA for smoothing, and incorporate volume for weighting in your heuristics.
Incorporate relative strength, moving averages, and volatility measures; smooth with exponential weighting for stability.
Incorporate volume and range for normalization, focus on intraday volatility for dynamic adjustment.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and volume for enhanced predictive power; consider intraday dynamics and smoothing techniques.
Incorporate momentum, volume changes, and price differences for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate volume changes, price efficiency, and smoothing for more robust and predictive alpha factors.
Integrate volume and amount with price changes; focus on intraday momentum and volatility.
Focus on intraday dynamics, leverage volume and amount for weighting, and enhance with high-low range for robustness.
Integrate volume trends, incorporate volatility measures, and consider relative strength for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate volatility, use rolling windows, and integrate market sentiment for enhanced predictive power.
