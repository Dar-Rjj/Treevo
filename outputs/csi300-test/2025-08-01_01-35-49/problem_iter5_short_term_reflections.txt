Incorporate trend strength and volume dynamics, balance short-term momentum with long-term stability.
Focus on integrating volatility, intraday returns, and volume; smooth with EMA for more stable signals.
Incorporate volume-weighted smoothing, long-term momentum, and non-linear transformations for enhanced predictive power.
Simplify calculations, maintain focus on core factors, and optimize EMA period for better performance.
Focus on volume-weighted returns, incorporate high-low range, and use multi-day sums for momentum.
Simplify, focus on core indicators, and refine smoothing techniques for better performance.
Integrate momentum, volume changes, and moving averages for a balanced approach to alpha factor generation.
Normalize and smooth factors, integrate volume, and apply non-linear transformations for better predictive power.
Incorporate volatility, leverage EMAs, integrate long-term trends, and apply non-linear transformations for enhanced predictive power.
Normalize long-term return, use relative rather than absolute values, and incorporate volume-weighted smoothing.
