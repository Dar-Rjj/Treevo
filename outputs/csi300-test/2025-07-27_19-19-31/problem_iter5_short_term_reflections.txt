Incorporate long-term trends, use exponential smoothing, and normalize factors for better stability and predictive power.
Incorporate shorter-term trends, use relative ratios, and integrate volume more effectively for enhanced factor responsiveness.
Integrate more market dynamics, use adaptive windows, and consider cross-sectional analysis for richer factor generation.
Incorporate more sophisticated volatility measures and consider relative strength against a benchmark.
