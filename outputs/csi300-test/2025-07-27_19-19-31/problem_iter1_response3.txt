```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the close and open prices
    price_diff = df['close'] - df['open']
    # Calculate the relative volume, which is the current volume divided by the mean of the previous 10 days' volumes
    relative_volume = df['volume'] / df['volume'].rolling(window=10).mean()
    # Combine the two factors
    factor_value = price_diff * relative_volume
    return factor_value
```
