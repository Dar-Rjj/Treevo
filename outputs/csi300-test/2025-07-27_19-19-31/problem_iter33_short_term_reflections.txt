Use weighted moving averages and standard rolling windows for more interpretable and effective factor construction.
Consider using more dynamic weights, integrating macroeconomic indicators, and testing with machine learning for factor selection.
Incorporate high and low price dynamics, use weighted averages, and integrate multiple time frames for robustness.
Incorporate high price WMA, optimize weights, and consider additional technical indicators for robustness.
