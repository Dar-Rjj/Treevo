Novel Alpha Factor: Volume-Adjusted Intraday and Closing Price Momentum with High-Low Range Stability
├── Calculate Combined Intraday and Closing Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-day Return: (Close[t] / Close[t-5]) - 1
│   ├── Compute 20-day Return: (Close[t] / Close[t-20]) - 1
│   ├── Combine 5-day and 20-day Returns: (5-day Return + 20-day Return) / 2
│   ├── Compute Intraday Return: (Close[t] - Open[t]) / Open[t]
│   └── Combine Intraday Price Range and Intraday Return: (High[t] - Low[t]) * Intraday Return
├── Integrate Volume Activity
│   ├── Determine Volume Trends: Volume(t) / Volume(t-1)
│   ├── Accumulate Volume Over Multiple Days: Sum of volumes over the past 5 days
│   └── Adjust Combined Intraday and Closing Price Momentum by Volume Trends: Multiply Combined Intraday and Closing Price Momentum by Volume Trend Ratio
├── Measure and Integrate High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Compute Rolling Standard Deviation of High-Low Range over M days
└── Combine and Smooth Factors
    ├── Compute Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices over N days
    ├── Subtract EMA from Current Close Price
    ├── Multiply by Average Volume over N days
    ├── Add the two adjusted momentums
    ├── Apply a 5-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to the combined momentum
    └── Final Alpha Factor: The 5-day EMA of the combined momentum, capturing both price and volume dynamics, adjusted for stability
