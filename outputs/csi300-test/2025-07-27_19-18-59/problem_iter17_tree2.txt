Crossover Alpha Factor: Enhanced Intraday and Closing Price Momentum, Volume-Weighted True Range, and High-Low Range Stability
├── Calculate Enhanced Intraday and Closing Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-day Return: (Close[t] / Close[t-5]) - 1
│   ├── Compute 20-day Return: (Close[t] / Close[t-20]) - 1
│   ├── Weighted Combination of 5-day and 20-day Returns: (2 * 5-day Return + 20-day Return) / 3
│   ├── Use High and Low prices
│   │   └── Subtract Low from High for each day
│   ├── Compute Intraday Return: (Close[t] - Open[t]) / Open[t]
│   ├── Combine Intraday Price Range and Intraday Return: (High[t] - Low[t]) * Intraday Return
│   └── Adjust Combined Momentum by Volume Trends
│       ├── Determine Volume Trend: Volume(t) / Volume(t-1)
│       ├── Accumulate Volume Over Multiple Days
│       │   ├── Sum up volumes over the past 5 days
│       │   └── This smooths out the volume to capture sustained trends
│       ├── Adjust Combined Intraday and Closing Price Momentum
│       │   └── Multiply Combined Intraday and Closing Price Momentum by Volume Trend Ratio
└── Integrate Volume-Weighted True Range
    ├── Find Maximum of (High - Low), |High - Previous Close|, |Low - Previous Close|
    └── Weight by Volume: True Range * (Volume(t) / Volume(t-1))
├── Measure and Integrate High-Low Range Stability
    ├── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation of Daily Range over M days
    ├── Combine Adjusted Momentum and Volume-Weighted True Range: Adjusted Momentum + Volume-Weighted True Range
    ├── Invert Rolling Standard Deviation to Reflect Stability
    └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with a 3-day span to the combined momentum for final alpha factor
└── Incorporate Weighted Sum with Predefined Weights
    ├── Compute Weighted Sum of the smoothed combined momentum and high-low range stability
    │   ├── Use predefined weights for the combined momentum and stability
    │   └── This balances the contribution of both components
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── The weighted sum of the smoothed combined momentum and high-low range stability
        └── This is the final alpha factor capturing both price and volume dynamics, adjusted for stability and weighted for balanced contribution
