Novel Alpha Factor: Volume-Adjusted and Weighted Intraday and Closing Price Momentum with High-Low Range Stability and Directional Bias
├── Calculate Combined Intraday and Closing Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-day Return
│   │   └── (Close[t] / Close[t-5]) - 1
│   ├── Compute 20-day Return
│   │   └── (Close[t] / Close[t-20]) - 1
│   ├── Weighted Combination of 5-day and 20-day Returns
│   │   └── (2 * 5-day Return + 20-day Return) / 3
│   ├── Use High and Low prices to determine intraday price range
│   │   └── High[t] - Low[t]
│   ├── Compute Intraday Return
│   │   ├── Subtract Open from Close
│   │   └── Divide by Open to obtain the daily return percentage
│   └── Combine Intraday Price Range and Intraday Return
│       ├── Multiply Intraday Price Range with Intraday Return
│       └── This combination captures the direction and volatility of the day
├── Integrate Volume Activity
│   ├── Determine Volume Trend
│   │   └── Volume(t) / Volume(t-1)
│   ├── Adjust Combined Intraday and Closing Price Momentum by Volume Trend
│   │   ├── Multiply Combined Intraday and Closing Price Momentum by sqrt(Volume Trend)
│   │   └── This adjusts the momentum by recent volume changes, enhancing the signal
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted True Range
│   ├── Find Maximum of (High - Low), |High - Previous Close|, |Low - Previous Close|
│   └── Weight by Volume
│       └── True Range * (Volume(t) / Volume(t-1))
├── Measure and Integrate High-Low Range Stability
│   ├── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation of Daily Range over M days
│   └── Invert Rolling Standard Deviation to Reflect Stability
├── Incorporate Directional Bias
│   ├── Compute 5-day Average Directional Index (ADX)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day ADX
│   │   └── This measures the strength of the trend
│   ├── Adjust Stability by Directional Bias
│   │   ├── Multiply Inverted Rolling Standard Deviation by 5-day ADX
│   │   └── This enhances the stability factor for strong trends
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Add the adjusted momentum and volume-weighted true range
│   └── This combines both momentum signals and true range
├── Smooth Combined Momentum
│   ├── Apply a 3-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to the combined factors
│   │   ├── This smooths out noise and provides a more stable signal
│   └── Final Alpha Factor
│       ├── The result of the 3-day EMA of the combined factors
│       └── This is the final alpha factor capturing both price and volume dynamics, adjusted for stability and directional bias
└── Incorporate Weighted Sum with Predefined Weights
    ├── Compute Weighted Sum of the smoothed combined momentum and high-low range stability
    │   ├── Use predefined weights for the combined momentum and stability
    │   └── This balances the contribution of both components
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── The weighted sum of the smoothed combined momentum and high-low range stability
        └── This is the final alpha factor capturing both price and volume dynamics, adjusted for stability, directional bias, and weighted for balanced contribution
