Crossover Alpha Factor: Enhanced Intraday and Closing Price Momentum with Volume-Adjusted True Range, High-Low Range Stability, and Directional Bias
├── Calculate Combined Intraday and Closing Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-day Return: (Close[t] / Close[t-5]) - 1
│   ├── Compute 20-day Return: (Close[t] / Close[t-20]) - 1
│   ├── Weighted Combination of 5-day and 20-day Returns: (3 * 5-day Return + 20-day Return) / 4
│   ├── Use High and Low prices to determine intraday price range: High[t] - Low[t]
│   ├── Compute Intraday Return: (Close[t] - Open[t]) / Open[t]
│   └── Combine Intraday Price Range and Intraday Return: (High[t] - Low[t]) * Intraday Return
├── Integrate Volume Activity
│   ├── Determine Volume Trend: Volume(t) / Volume(t-1)
│   ├── Accumulate Volume Over Multiple Days: Sum up volumes over the past 5 days
│   └── Adjust Combined Intraday and Closing Price Momentum: Combined Momentum * (Volume Trend ** 0.8) * (Accumulated Volume / 5)
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted True Range
│   ├── Find Maximum of (High - Low), |High - Previous Close|, |Low - Previous Close|
│   └── Weight by Volume: True Range * (Volume(t) / Volume(t-1)) ** 0.6
├── Measure and Integrate High-Low Range Stability
│   ├── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation of Daily Range over M days
│   ├── Invert Rolling Standard Deviation to Reflect Stability
│   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with a 7-day span to the combined momentum for final alpha factor
├── Incorporate Directional Bias
│   ├── Compute 5-day Average Directional Index (ADX)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day ADX
│   │   └── This measures the strength of the trend
│   ├── Adjust Stability by Directional Bias
│   │   ├── Multiply Inverted Rolling Standard Deviation by 5-day ADX
│   │   └── This enhances the stability factor for strong trends
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Add the adjusted momentum and volume-weighted true range: Adjusted Momentum + Volume-Adjusted True Range
│   └── This combines both momentum signals and true range
├── Smooth Combined Momentum
│   ├── Apply a 3-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) to the combined factors
│   │   ├── This smooths out noise and provides a more stable signal
│   └── Final Alpha Factor
│       ├── The result of the 3-day SMA of the combined factors
│       └── This is the final alpha factor capturing both price and volume dynamics, adjusted for stability and directional bias
└── Incorporate Weighted Sum with Predefined Weights
    ├── Compute Weighted Sum of the smoothed combined momentum, high-low range stability, and directional bias
    │   ├── Use predefined weights for the combined momentum, stability, and directional bias
    │   └── This balances the contribution of all components
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── The weighted sum of the smoothed combined momentum, high-low range stability, and directional bias
        └── This is the final alpha factor capturing both price and volume dynamics, adjusted for stability, directional bias, and weighted for balanced contribution
