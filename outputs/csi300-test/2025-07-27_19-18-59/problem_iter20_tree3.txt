Crossover Alpha Factor: Enhanced Intraday and Closing Price Momentum with Volume-Adjusted True Range and High-Low Range Stability
├── Calculate Enhanced Intraday and Closing Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-day Return: (Close[t] / Close[t-5]) - 1
│   ├── Compute 20-day Return: (Close[t] / Close[t-20]) - 1
│   ├── Weighted Combination of 5-day and 20-day Returns: (3 * 5-day Return + 20-day Return) / 4
│   ├── Compute Intraday Return: (Close[t] - Open[t]) / Open[t]
│   └── Combine Intraday Price Range and Intraday Return: (High[t] - Low[t]) * Intraday Return
├── Integrate Volume Activity
│   ├── Determine Volume Trend: Volume(t) / Volume(t-1)
│   ├── Accumulate Volume Over Multiple Days: Sum up volumes over the past 5 days
│   └── Adjust Enhanced Intraday and Closing Price Momentum: Combined Momentum * (Volume Trend ** 0.75) * (Accumulated Volume / 5)
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted True Range
│   ├── Find Maximum of (High - Low), |High - Previous Close|, |Low - Previous Close|
│   └── Weight by Volume: True Range * (Volume(t) / Volume(t-1)) ** 0.5
├── Measure and Integrate High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation of Daily Range over M days
│   ├── Combine Adjusted Momentum and Volume-Adjusted True Range: Adjusted Momentum + Volume-Adjusted True Range
│   ├── Invert Rolling Standard Deviation to Reflect Stability
│   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with a 5-day span to the combined momentum for final alpha factor
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Compute Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices over N days
│   │   └── Use Close Price
│   ├── Subtract SMA from Current Close Price
│   │   └── Use Close Price
│   └── Multiply by Average Volume over N days
│       └── Use Volume
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Add the two adjusted momentums: Adjusted Momentum + Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   └── This combines both momentum signals
├── Smooth Combined Momentum
│   ├── Apply a 3-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) to the combined momentum
│   │   ├── This smooths out noise and provides a more stable signal
│   └── Final Alpha Factor
│       ├── The result of the 3-day SMA of the combined momentum
│       └── This is the final alpha factor capturing both price and volume dynamics, adjusted for stability
└── Incorporate Weighted Sum with Predefined Weights
    ├── Compute Weighted Sum of the smoothed combined momentum and high-low range volatility
    │   ├── Use predefined weights for the combined momentum and volatility
    │   └── This balances the contribution of both components
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── The weighted sum of the smoothed combined momentum and high-low range volatility
        └── This is the final alpha factor capturing both price and volume dynamics, adjusted for stability and weighted for balanced contribution
