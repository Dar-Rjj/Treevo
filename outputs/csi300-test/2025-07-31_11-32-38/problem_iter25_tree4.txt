Crossover of Momentum and Volume-Weighted Indicators with Intraday Volatility and Price Movements
├── Calculate Price Momentum Factor
│   └── Difference between the close price of day t and the close price n days ago
├── Incorporate Trading Volume into the Analysis
│   └── Ratio of volume on day t to the average volume over the past m days
├── Explore the Relationship Between Open and Close Prices
│   ├── Measure the difference between the open and close prices for each day up to t
│   └── Compute the moving sum of these differences over a specific window (e.g., p days)
├── Analyze the Range of Daily Price Fluctuations
│   ├── Calculate the range (High - Low) for day t
│   └── Examine the moving average of these ranges over q days
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Daily Returns
│   └── Use Close price (Day t) and Close price (Day t-1)
├── Compute Intraday Return
│   └── Use High price (Day t) and Low price (Day t)
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   └── Use Close price (Day t) and Open price (Day t)
├── Calculate Logarithmic Volume Difference
│   └── Use Volume (Day t) and Volume (Day t-1)
├── Weigh by Intraday Volume Activity
│   ├── Use Volume (Day t)
│   └── Divide Daily Volume by 20-Day Moving Average
├── Integrate Components
│   ├── Combine Intraday and Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   ├── Weight Intraday Return by its absolute value
│   │   └── Weight Close-to-Open Return by its absolute value
│   ├── Adjust weights by multiplying them with the Logarithmic Volume Difference
│   ├── Combine Volume-Weighted Momentum with Price Range
│   │   ├── Compute Raw Momentum using Close price of the current day (t) and n days ago (t-n)
│   │   ├── Weight by Cumulative Volume from day (t-n) to day (t-1)
│   │   └── Add Price Range (High - Low) of the current day (t)
│   ├── Multiply Combined Momentum by Volume Ratio
│   ├── Apply 5-Day Exponential Moving Average
│   │   └── Set Smoothing Factor to 0.2
│   ├── Multiply Volume-Weighted Daily Returns by Adjusted Weights
└── Incorporate Intraday Range Breakouts
    ├── Calculate Intraday Range Breakout using High, Low of Day t and Previous Day's High and Low
    └── Weight Breakout by Intraday Volume
