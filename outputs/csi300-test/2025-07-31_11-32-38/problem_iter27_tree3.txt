Thought: Explore price action and volume patterns to generate alpha factors
- Thought: Analyze closing prices for trend and momentum
  - Thought: Calculate the difference between the close of day t and the close of day t-1 (Daily Price Change)
  - Thought: Sum the Daily Price Changes over a lookback window (e.g., 10 days) to assess short-term momentum
  - Thought: Calculate the cumulative sum of daily price changes over a longer period (e.g., 50 days) to identify medium-term trends
- Thought: Consider the range (high - low) as an indicator of volatility
  - Thought: Calculate daily range (High - Low) to measure volatility
  - Thought: Compute the average daily range over a recent period (e.g., 20 days) for a smoother volatility metric
  - Thought: Determine the ratio of the current day's range to the average range over the past 20 days (Volatility Ratio)
- Thought: Investigate the relationship between opening and closing prices
  - Thought: Determine if the close is higher or lower than the open (Directional Move)
  - Thought: Track the net number of upward and downward moves over a defined period (e.g., 30 days) as a sentiment indicator
  - Thought: Calculate the average directional move over a longer period (e.g., 60 days) to gauge persistent trends
- Thought: Examine volume in conjunction with price movements
  - Thought: Evaluate the ratio of volume on up days to down days (Volume Ratio)
  - Thought: Calculate the total volume over a specific time frame (e.g., 50 days) to gauge interest and liquidity
  - Thought: Identify the number of days with volume above the 20-day average to measure strong trading activity
- Thought: Explore the impact of amount (trading value) on stock performance
  - Thought: Measure the amount change from one day to the next (Amount Change)
  - Thought: Calculate the cumulative amount change over a lookback period (e.g., 60 days) to assess capital flow trends
  - Thought: Determine the ratio of the current day's amount to the average amount over the past 20 days (Amount Ratio)
- Thought: Combine multiple factors to create composite alpha signals
  - Thought: Create a composite score by weighting and summing the momentum, volatility, directional moves, and volume indicators
  - Thought: Rank stocks based on the composite score to identify potential outperformers
  - Thought: Incorporate the cumulative amount change as a factor in the composite score to capture capital flow dynamics
