Thought: Explore Enhanced Price and Volume Indicators for Alpha Generation
- Thought: Analyze the relationship between price and volume
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of close to open prices (Close/Open)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of high to low prices (High/Low)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) of trading volume over a period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between current day's volume and the EMA volume
- Thought: Investigate Momentum and Reversal Patterns
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the percentage change in close price over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the percentage change in close price over a long period (e.g., 60 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Determine the number of days the close price has been increasing or decreasing consecutively
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the rate of change (ROC) of the close price over a period (e.g., 14 days)
- Thought: Examine Range and Volatility
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily price range (High - Low)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the average true range over a period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the standard deviation of returns over a period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the volatility index (VIX) over a period
- Thought: Analyze Volume-Price Trends
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) over a period
  - Sub-Thought: Determine the percentage change in OBV over a period
  - Sub-Thought: Identify the direction of the OBV trend (up, down, or neutral)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the money flow index (MFI) over a period (e.g., 14 days)
- Thought: Evaluate Gaps and Breakouts
  - Sub-Thought: Identify if there is a gap between the previous day's close and the current day's open
  - Sub-Thought: Determine the size and direction of the gap
  - Sub-Thought: Check if the current day's high or low breaks through a significant level (e.g., 52-week high/low)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the breakout momentum by comparing the current close to the previous period's high/low
