Thought: Enhancing Alpha Generation by Incorporating Volume and Price Dynamics with Momentum and Reversal Indicators
├── Calculate Intraday Momentum
│   ├── (High - Low) / Low
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── (Close - Open) / Open
├── Weighted Sum of Intraday and Close-to-Open Returns
│   ├── Weight Intraday Return by its absolute value
│   ├── Weight Close-to-Open Return by its absolute value
│   └── Sum the weighted returns to get Preliminary Factor
├── Calculate True Range (TR)
│   ├── Max(High - Low, abs(High - Previous Close), abs(Low - Previous Close))
├── Calculate Positive Directional Movement (+DM)
│   ├── If Current High > Previous High and (Current High - Previous High) > (Previous Low - Current Low)
│   │   └── Current High - Previous High
│   └── Otherwise 0
├── Calculate Negative Directional Movement (-DM)
│   ├── If Previous Low > Current Low and (Previous Low - Current Low) > (Current High - Previous High)
│   │   └── Previous Low - Current Low
│   └── Otherwise 0
├── Calculate +DI
│   ├── Smooth +DM and divide by TR
├── Calculate -DI
│   ├── Smooth -DM and divide by TR
├── Calculate ADMI
│   ├── (+DI - -DI) / (+DI + -DI)
├── Multiply Preliminary Factor by ADMI
│   └── Result is the intermediate alpha factor
├── Analyze Close Price Trends
│   ├── Identify the direction of the close price change (up or down)
└── Examine the Relationship Between Close Price and Volume
    ├── Calculate the ratio of close price to average volume over a trailing period
└── Assess the Volatility
    ├── Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns over a trailing window
    └── Use this as a measure to weight the predictive power of other factors
└── Combine Intermediate Alpha Factor with New Components
    └── Final Alpha Factor
