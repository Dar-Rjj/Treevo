├── Calculate Simple Moving Averages (SMA) of Close Prices
│   ├── SMA over a 10-day period
│   └── SMA over a 30-day period
├── Measure Price Changes to Capture Short-Term Momentum
│   └── Calculate the daily price change as the difference between today's close and yesterday's close
├── Analyze Trading Volume for Liquidity and Activity Signals
│   └── Daily volume change as a percentage of the previous day's volume
├── Evaluate Volatility Using True Range

├── Calculate Directional Movements
│   ├── Positive Directional Movement (+DM)
│   │   └── If Current High > Previous High and Current Low >= Previous Low, then 
│   │       └── Current High - Previous High; otherwise 0
│   ├── Negative Directional Movement (-DM)
│   │   └── If Current Low < Previous Low and Current High <= Previous High, then

│       └── Divide -DM Smoothed by ATR
├── Compute Average Directional Movement Index (ADMI)
│   ├── Difference between +DI and -DI
│   └── Divide by sum of +DI and -DI
├── Combine Intraday and Interday Momentum
│   ├── Add 10-Day EMA of Daily Price Changes to Intraday Price Trend
