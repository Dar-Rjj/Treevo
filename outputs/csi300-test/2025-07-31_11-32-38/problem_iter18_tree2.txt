Performing alpha mining to generate novel and interpretable factors for predicting future stock returns
- Factor 1: Momentum Indicators
  - Calculate the difference between today's close price and the close price 5 days ago (short-term momentum)
  - Compute the moving average of closing prices over the last 20 days, then subtract this from the current close price (trend-following signal)
- Factor 2: Volume-Weighted Close Price
  - Sum of (close price * volume) / total volume over the last 10 trading days
- Factor 3: Volatility Measures
  - Standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns over the past 30 days as a measure of volatility
- Factor 4: Relative Strength Compared to Market
  - Ratio of the stock's 10-day return to the market index's 10-day return
- Factor 5: Accumulation/Distribution Line
  - Cumulative flow of money into and out of the stock over time: (Close - Low) - (High - Close) / (High - Low) * Volume, summed over the last 20 days
- Factor 6: Money Flow Index
  - Over the last 14 days, Positive Money Flow is sum of (Typical Price[t] - Typical Price[t-1]) when Typical Price[t] > Typical Price[t-1], where Typical Price = (High + Low + Close)/3
  - Negative Money Flow is sum of (Typical Price[t-1] - Typical Price[t]) when Typical Price[t] < Typical Price[t-1]
  - Money Flow Ratio = 100 * (Positive Money Flow / (Positive Money Flow + Negative Money Flow))
  - Money Flow Index = 100 - 100 / (1 + Money Flow Ratio)
- Factor 7: Trading Range Expansion
  - Measure how much the range (High - Low) has expanded or contracted relative to the average range over the previous 20 days
- Factor 8: Daily Return Reversal Indicator
  - If the absolute value of the daily return (today's close - yesterday's close / yesterday's close) is above a certain threshold, flag it as a potential reversal day
- Factor 9: High Minus Low Over Close
  - (High - Low) / Close, averaged over the last 10 days, indicating the intra-day price movement relative to the closing price
- Factor 10: Gap Up/Down Open
  - Record if there was a significant gap up or down at the open by comparing the opening price to the previous day's high and low
  - If Open > Previous Day's High, mark as a gap up
  - If Open < Previous Day's Low, mark as a gap down
- Factor 11: Volume Shock
  - Identify days with abnormally high trading volume compared to the average volume over the last 20 days
  - Volume shock defined as (Volume of the day - Average Volume of the last 20 days) / Average Volume of the last 20 days
- Factor 12: Price Impact of Volume
  - Correlation between daily returns and daily volume changes over the last 30 days to see if higher volumes lead to larger price movements
