Thought: Exploring Price Patterns for Predicting Stock Returns
  - Thought: Analyzing daily price movements
    - Sub-thought: Calculating daily returns
      - Sub-thought: Daily return (close_t / close_{t-1} - 1)
  - Thought: Investigating volume and price relationship
    - Sub-thought: Volume-weighted average price
      - Sub-thought: VWAP = (sum(price * volume) / sum(volume)) over a period
    - Sub-thought: Volume-to-price change ratio
      - Sub-thought: Ratio = volume_t / (close_t - close_{t-1})
  - Thought: Identifying trend reversals using high and low prices
    - Sub-thought: High-low spread
      - Sub-thought: High-Low Spread = high_t - low_t
    - Sub-thought: Trend reversal indicator
      - Sub-thought: If (high_t < low_{t-1}) then 1, else 0
  - Thought: Analyzing intraday price range
    - Sub-thought: Intraday price range
      - Sub-thought: Intraday Range = high_t - low_t
    - Sub-thought: Ratio of close to intraday range
      - Sub-thought: Close to Range Ratio = (close_t - low_t) / (high_t - low_t)
