Thought: Calculate the Price Momentum Factor
- Calculate the difference between the close price of day t and the close price n days ago
  - This sub-thought directly leads to an interpretable alpha factor, indicating a trend in the stock's movement
- No further sub-thoughts required as this captures a simple yet effective momentum strategy without normalization or global statistics

Thought: Incorporate Trading Volume into the Analysis
- Consider the ratio of volume on day t to the average volume over the past m days
  - By focusing on the relative change in trading volume, we can gauge changes in market interest or liquidity
  - Avoiding any form of data normalization or using global statistics ensures the signal is purely based on recent trading activity
- No further sub-thoughts needed since this thought introduces a way to assess how unusual the current day's volume is compared to recent history

Thought: Explore the Relationship Between Open and Close Prices
- Measure the difference between the open and close prices for each day up to t
  - This insight offers a daily perspective on market sentiment, with positive values suggesting bullish trends and negative values bearish
- Compute the moving sum of these differences over a specific window (e.g., p days)
  - A cumulative measure like this reflects the overall direction of short-term price movements, which can be an indicator of underlying market dynamics
- No need for additional sub-thoughts, as this already provides a direct and unnormalized view of intraday trading patterns

Thought: Analyze the Range of Daily Price Fluctuations
- Calculate the range (High - Low) for day t
  - Understanding the magnitude of daily price swings can offer insights into market volatility and potential for future price movements
- Examine the moving average of these ranges over q days
  - This step helps in identifying periods of high or low volatility without normalizing the data, making it a straightforward volatility indicator
- No further sub-thoughts are necessary, as this thought encapsulates a method to assess and utilize information about market volatility for predicting returns
