Thought: Create Alpha Factors from OHLC and Volume Data
- Sub-Thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Idea: Develop a Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover Strategy
    - Factor: SMA(50) - SMA(200)
  - Idea: Implement a Rate of Change (ROC) Indicator
    - Factor: (Close_t / Close_(t-252)) - 1
- Sub-Thought: Volume-Based Factors
  - Idea: Volume Trend Indicator
    - Factor: If (Volume_t > Volume_(t-1), 1, -1)
  - Idea: Money Flow Index (MFI)
    - Component 1: Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3
    - Component 2: Raw Money Flow = Typical Price * Volume
    - Component 3: Positive Money Flow = Sum of Raw Money Flows for days with Positive Price Change over n-period
    - Component 4: Negative Money Flow = Sum of Raw Money Flows for days with Negative Price Change over n-period
    - Factor: 100 - (100 / (1 + (Positive Money Flow / Negative Money Flow)))
- Sub-Thought: Market Strength Indicators
  - Idea: Accumulation/Distribution Line
    - Component: Money Flow Multiplier = ((Close - Low) - (High - Close)) / (High - Low)
    - Factor: Cumulative sum of (Money Flow Multiplier * Volume)
  - Idea: On-Balance-Volume (OBV)
    - Rule: If Close_t > Close_(t-1), OBV = OBV_(t-1) + Volume_t
    - Rule: If Close_t < Close_(t-1), OBV = OBV_(t-1) - Volume_t
    - Rule: If Close_t = Close_(t-1), OBV = OBV_(t-1)
- Sub-Thought: Pattern Recognition
  - Idea: Inside Bar Pattern Detection
    - Condition 1: High_t < High_(t-1) AND Low_t > Low_(t-1)
    - Condition 2: Look for Breakouts or Reversals Following the Pattern
    - Factor: 1 (Pattern Identified), 0 (No Pattern)
  - Idea: Engulfing Candlestick Pattern
    - Condition 1: Current Day's Range engulfs Previous Day's Range
    - Condition 2: Color Contrast between Days (Bullish vs. Bearish)
    - Factor: 1 (Bullish Engulfing), -1 (Bearish Engulfing), 0 (None)
- Sub-Thought: Volatility Measures
  - Idea: True Range (TR) as an Indicator
    - Formula: TR = Max[(High - Low), Abs(High - Close(t-1)), Abs(Low - Close(t-1))]
    - Factor: TR averaged over n periods (Average True Range, ATR)
  - Idea: Bollinger Bands
    - Component: Middle Band = SMA(Close, n)
    - Component: Standard Deviation = StDev(Close, n)
    - Factor: (Close - SMA(Close, n)) / (2 * Standard Deviation)
