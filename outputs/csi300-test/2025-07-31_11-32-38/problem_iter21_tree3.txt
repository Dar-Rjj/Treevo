Thought: Enhance the Price Momentum Factor with Volume Weighting
- Calculate the weighted difference between the close price of day t and the close price n days ago
  - Use the ratio of volume on day t to the average volume over the past m days as a weight
  - This sub-thought integrates both price momentum and relative volume, providing a more nuanced view of market interest
- No further sub-thoughts required as this captures an enhanced momentum strategy without normalization or global statistics

Thought: Incorporate Trading Volume into the Analysis with Price Movement
- Consider the ratio of volume on day t to the average volume over the past m days
  - By focusing on the relative change in trading volume, we can gauge changes in market interest or liquidity
  - Avoiding any form of data normalization or using global statistics ensures the signal is purely based on recent trading activity
- Multiply the volume ratio by the daily return (close price of day t minus open price of day t)
  - This step incorporates the intraday price movement, giving more weight to significant price changes on high-volume days

Thought: Explore the Relationship Between Open and Close Prices with Volume Trend
- Measure the difference between the open and close prices for each day up to t
  - This insight offers a daily perspective on market sentiment, with positive values suggesting bullish trends and negative values bearish
- Compute the moving sum of these differences over a specific window (e.g., p days)
  - A cumulative measure like this reflects the overall direction of short-term price movements, which can be an indicator of underlying market dynamics
- Multiply the moving sum by the trend of the volume over the same window
  - The trend of volume can be calculated as the slope of a linear regression over the past p days
  - This sub-thought combines the cumulative price movement with the volume trend, providing a more comprehensive view of market dynamics

Thought: Analyze the Range of Daily Price Fluctuations with Volume Adjustments
- Calculate the range (High - Low) for day t
  - Understanding the magnitude of daily price swings can offer insights into market volatility and potential for future price movements
- Examine the moving average of these ranges over q days
  - This step helps in identifying periods of high or low volatility without normalizing the data, making it a straightforward volatility indicator
- Adjust the moving average of the range by the average volume over the same q days
  - This adjustment accounts for the impact of volume on the perceived volatility, providing a more accurate picture of market conditions
