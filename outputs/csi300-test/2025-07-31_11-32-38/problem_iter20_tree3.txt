Thought: Combining Intraday Momentum, Reversal, and Directional Movement with Price Patterns and Volume for Enhanced Alpha Generation
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   ├── (High - Low) / Low
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── (Close - Open) / Open
├── Weighted Sum of Intraday and Close-to-Open Returns
│   ├── Weight Intraday Return by its absolute value
│   ├── Weight Close-to-Open Return by its absolute value
│   └── Sum the weighted returns to get Preliminary Factor
├── Calculate True Range (TR)
│   ├── Max(High - Low, abs(High - Previous Close), abs(Low - Previous Close))
├── Calculate Positive Directional Movement (+DM)
│   ├── If Current High > Previous High and (Current High - Previous High) > (Previous Low - Current Low)
│   │   └── Current High - Previous High
│   └── Otherwise 0
├── Calculate Negative Directional Movement (-DM)
│   ├── If Previous Low > Current Low and (Previous Low - Current Low) > (Current High - Previous High)
│   │   └── Previous Low - Current Low
│   └── Otherwise 0
├── Calculate +DI
│   ├── Smooth +DM and divide by TR
├── Calculate -DI
│   ├── Smooth -DM and divide by TR
├── Calculate ADMI
│   ├── (+DI - -DI) / (+DI + -DI)
├── Multiply Preliminary Factor by ADMI
│   └── Result is the intermediate alpha factor
├── Analyze close price trends
│   ├── Identify the direction of the close price change (up or down)
├── Examine the relationship between close price and volume
│   ├── Calculate the ratio of close price to average volume over a trailing period
│   └── Investigate the impact of this ratio on future returns
├── Look at intra-day price action
│   ├── Measure the intra-day range (high - low)
│   ├── Calculate the percentage of the intra-day range that is above the previous close
├── Consider the open-to-close behavior
│   ├── Compute the difference between open and close prices
│   ├── Determine if the day's closing price is higher or lower than the opening price
│   ├── Combine with volume to assess the strength of the move
└── Evaluate the high and low prices
    ├── Compare the high and low prices with the previous day's high and low
    ├── Count the number of days in a row where the high is higher than the previous day's high
    ├── Count the number of days in a row where the low is lower than the previous day's low
└── Assess the volatility
    ├── Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns over a trailing window
    └── Use this as a measure to weight the predictive power of other factors
└── Combine intermediate alpha factor with the new components
    └── Final alpha factor
