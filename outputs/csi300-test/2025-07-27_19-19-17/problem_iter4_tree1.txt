Average True Range Momentum
├── Calculate Average True Range (ATR)
│   ├── Compute True Range (TR) for each day
│   │   └── Take the maximum of: High - Low, High - Previous Close, Low - Previous Close
│   └── Average TR over a 14-day window
└── Combine with Price Momentum
    ├── Calculate Short-term SMA (10 days) of Close price
    ├── Calculate Long-term SMA (50 days) of Close price
    ├── Compute the difference between Short-term SMA and Long-term SMA
    └── Multiply the difference by ATR
        └── Use this product as the final alpha factor
