Modified Average True Range Momentum with Volume and Amount Integration
├── Calculate Average True Range (ATR)
│   ├── Compute True Range (TR) for each day
│   │   ├── Take the maximum of:
│   │   │   ├── High - Low
│   │   │   ├── High - Previous Close
│   │   │   └── Low - Previous Close
│   └── Average TR over a window, e.g., 14 days
├── Incorporate Volume and Amount Factors
│   ├── Calculate the volume difference between current and previous day
│   ├── Calculate the amount difference between current and previous day
│   ├── Sum the volume and amount differences
│   └── Normalize the sum by average volume and amount over a window, e.g., 20 days
└── Combine ATR and Volume-Amount Factor with Price Momentum
    ├── Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close price
    │   └── Over a short-term period, e.g., 10 days
    ├── Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close price
    │   └── Over a long-term period, e.g., 50 days
    ├── Compute the difference between the two SMAs
    ├── Multiply the SMA difference by the ATR
    ├── Adjust the product by adding the normalized volume-amount difference
    └── Use this adjusted product as the final alpha factor
