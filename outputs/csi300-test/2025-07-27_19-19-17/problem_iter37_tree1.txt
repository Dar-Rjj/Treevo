Calculate True Range (TR) for each day
├── Max of:
│   ├── High - Low
│   ├── abs(High - Previous Close)
│   └── abs(Low - Previous Close)
Calculate Average True Range (ATR)
└── Average TR over a 14-day window
Incorporate Intraday and Open-to-Close Returns
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Open-to-Close Return
│   ├── Subtract Open from Close
├── Integrate Returns
│   ├── Add Intraday Return and Open-to-Close Return
Adjust with Volume Factor
├── Calculate the volume difference between current and previous day
├── If Volume > Previous Day's Volume
└── Adjust the volume difference by average volume over a 20-day window
Combine ATR, Integrated Returns, and Volume Adjustment
├── Multiply ATR by the integrated return
├── Add the adjusted volume difference
Calculate Price Momentum
├── Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close price over 10 days
├── Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close price over 50 days
├── Compute the difference between the two SMAs
├── Multiply the SMA difference by the adjusted ATR
Integrate High-Low and Close-Open for Additional Momentum
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Multiply Intraday High-Low Spread by Open-to-Close Return
├── Smooth the Integrated Momentum
│   ├── Apply EMA with a 5-day window
Final Alpha Factor
├── Combine Weighted Integrated Return and Smoothed Integrated Momentum
├── Divide Combined Factor by Square Root of Volume
├── Multiply by (Current Volume / Maximum Volume over last 10 days)
└── Add Adjusted ATR and Price Momentum
