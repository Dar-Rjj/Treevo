Integrated and Enhanced Alpha Factor with Intraday, Volume, and ATR Momentum
├── Calculate True Range (TR) for each day
│   └── Max of:
│       ├── High - Low
│       ├── High - Previous Close
│       └── Low - Previous Close
├── Calculate Average True Range (ATR)
│   └── Average TR over a 14-day window
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Close-Open Return
│   ├── Subtract Open from Close
├── Integrate Returns
│   ├── Weighted Sum of Intraday High-Low Spread and Close-Open Return
│   │   ├── Assign weight to Intraday High-Low Spread
│   │   └── Assign weight to Close-Open Return
└── Smooth the Integrated Returns
    ├── Use Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on Integrated Returns
    │   ├── Choose EMA window size (e.g., 5 days)
    │   └── Apply EMA
└── Adjust for Volume and Amount Confirmation
    ├── Check Volume
    │   ├── If Volume > Previous Day's Volume
    │   │   └── Multiply Integrated Returns by (Current Volume / Previous Volume)
    └── Check Amount
        ├── If Amount > Previous Day's Amount
        │   └── Multiply Integrated Returns by (Current Amount / Previous Amount)
    └── Final Adjustment
        ├── If both Volume and Amount conditions are met
        │   └── Multiply Integrated Returns by (Current Volume / Previous Volume) * (Current Amount / Previous Amount)
└── Price Momentum
    ├── Short-term SMA (10 days) of Close price
    ├── Long-term SMA (50 days) of Close price
    └── Difference between Short-term SMA and Long-term SMA
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── (Smoothed Integrated Return + Adjusted Integrated Returns) * (Difference * ATR)
    └── Add the sum of volume and amount differences
