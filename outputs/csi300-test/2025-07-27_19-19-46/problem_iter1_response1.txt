```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the ratio of the volume to the amount, which can be seen as a normalized dollar volume
    dollar_vol_ratio = (df['volume'] * df['close']) / (df['amount'] + 1e-7)
    
    # Calculate the relative strength, which is the difference between close and open divided by close
    rel_strength = (df['close'] - df['open']) / (df['close'] + 1e-7)
    
    # Combine the two factors using their product to create a factor that could indicate momentum combined with liquidity
    return dollar_vol_ratio * rel_strength
```
