Simplify calculations, use rolling mean for momentum, and normalize volatility without standard deviation for improved interpretability.
Adjust window sizes dynamically, use exponential smoothing, and incorporate more market indicators for robustness.
Adapt window sizes, integrate dynamic volatility, and refine momentum calculations for improved factor responsiveness and robustness.
Adaptively adjust windows, integrate volume-weighted metrics, and use dynamic volatility for improved factor responsiveness.
