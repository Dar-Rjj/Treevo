Balance factors, use adaptive windows, handle zeros, and incorporate macro indicators for robustness.
Use adaptive windows, refine factor weights, and ensure robustness against missing data for better heuristics.
Adjust factor weights, refine trend calculation, and handle zero division for more robust and interpretable alpha factors.
Refine weights, handle zero divisions, and use adaptive windows for dynamic market conditions.
