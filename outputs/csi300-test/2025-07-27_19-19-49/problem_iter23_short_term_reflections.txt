Normalize factors, consider interactions, and balance components for more stable and predictive alpha factors.
Incorporate mean reversion, use adaptive windows, and apply normalization to improve factor stability and predictive power.
Shorter momentum, fewer interactions, and no normalization in the better code. Consider shorter windows and select interactions carefully.
Normalize factors, consider interactions, and use stable long-term trends for better performance.
