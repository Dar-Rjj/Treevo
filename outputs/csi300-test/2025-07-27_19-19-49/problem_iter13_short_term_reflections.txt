Adjust window sizes, incorporate adaptive momentum, and balance factor contributions for improved stability and responsiveness.
Shorter periods, normalization, and balancing momentum, volatility, and volume trends enhance factor performance.
Shorter periods, simplified calculations, and combining factors effectively can improve alpha factor performance.
