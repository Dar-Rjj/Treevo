Shorter windows, normalization, and combining factors can improve alpha factor performance.
Normalize factors, adjust window sizes, and consider shorter-term trends for more responsive alpha signals.
Normalize factors, balance contributions, and consider factor interactions for improved alpha generation.
Consider shorter time frames, normalization, and combining factors for more responsive and balanced alpha signals.
