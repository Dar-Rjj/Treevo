Adjust periods for sensitivity, incorporate interaction terms, and balance factor weights.
Increase window sizes for stability, normalize factors, and consider long-term trends and interactions.
Incorporate short-term signals, dynamic volume trends, and non-linear interactions for more responsive and robust alpha factors.
Adjust window sizes for stability, consider more interaction terms, and normalize factors for better performance.
