Shorter periods for momentum, ATR, and volume trends; balance between responsiveness and stability.
Incorporate more sophisticated momentum, volume, and volatility indicators; consider machine learning for feature extraction.
Consider longer-term indicators, incorporate price and volume weights, and use rolling means for stability.
Integrate more diverse indicators, use longer-term trends, and normalize factors for stability.
