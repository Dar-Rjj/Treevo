Incorporate sector and macroeconomic data, refine interaction terms, and normalize factors for better comparability.
Incorporate sector-specific data, use dynamic weighting, and explore more sophisticated interaction terms.
Incorporate sector returns, refine interaction terms, and normalize alpha factor components.
Incorporate sector momentum, use GARCH on returns, and balance factor contributions for improved stability and predictive power.
