Incorporate adaptive periods, combine multiple indicators, and use weighted sums for robust alpha factors.
Simplify, focus on core indicators, and avoid over-combining factors to reduce noise and improve signal clarity.
Incorporate multi-period analysis, adaptive measures, and relative strength for more robust and dynamic alpha factors.
Increase window sizes for smoother trends; simplify factor combination; consider more diverse features.
