```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the momentum factor using the change in close price over the last 10 days
    momentum = df['close'].pct_change(periods=10)
    
    # Calculate the liquidity factor using the average volume over the last 20 days
    liquidity = df['volume'].rolling(window=20).mean()
    
    # Create a combined factor by multiplying the momentum and liquidity
    # The idea is that stocks with positive momentum and high liquidity may outperform
    factor = (momentum + 1) * (liquidity / liquidity.mean())
    
    return factor
```
