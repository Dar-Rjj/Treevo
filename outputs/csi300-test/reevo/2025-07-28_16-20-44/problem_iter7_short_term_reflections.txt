Incorporate multi-period analysis, use logarithmic returns, and combine diverse signals for robustness.
Shorter windows, ATR for volatility, and simplified factor combinations improve performance and interpretability.
Incorporate multiple time frames, normalize factors, and consider inverse relationships for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Incorporate longer-term trends, normalize factors, and consider multi-period averages for more robust signals.
Incorporate more diverse signals, use relative measures, and balance factor contributions.
Remove volatility, simplify and focus on momentum, liquidity, and market sentiment for clearer signals.
Focus on key factors, simplify, and avoid overcomplicating with too many variables or transformations.
Normalize factors, use meaningful ratios, and consider inverse relationships for volatility to improve heuristic performance.
Incorporate more market dynamics, use multi-period analysis, and normalize factors for better comparability.
Incorporate multi-period analysis, normalize factors, and balance momentum, liquidity, sentiment, and volatility for robustness.
