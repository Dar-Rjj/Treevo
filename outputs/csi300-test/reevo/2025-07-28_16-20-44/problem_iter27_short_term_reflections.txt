Integrate dynamic lookback, RSI, MACD; use rolling stats for adaptability and combine factors multiplicatively.
Normalize factors, weight equally, and focus on key financial indicators for improved predictive performance.
Simplify, focus on recent data, and normalize factors for balanced contribution.
Simplify calculations, use shorter windows, and apply exponential decay to the final combined factor for emphasis on recent data.
Simplify factors, use consistent lookback periods, and apply exponential decay for recency bias.
Simplify calculations, normalize using median, incorporate external data, and combine factors multiplicatively for better robustness.
Simplify calculations, use recent data emphasis, and balance factor contributions for improved interpretability and performance.
Use exponential weighting for smoother factors, adjust lookback periods, and consider sector-specific external data.
Incorporate adaptive weighting, reduce lookback periods, and add sector-specific adjustments for improved factor performance.
Incorporate sector trends, use dynamic weighting, and include macroeconomic indicators for enhanced predictive power.
