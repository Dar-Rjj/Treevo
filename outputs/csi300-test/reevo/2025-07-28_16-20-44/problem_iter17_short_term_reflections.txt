Adjust weights, reduce lookback for responsiveness, consider factor capping, and add macroeconomic indicators.
Adjust lookback periods, normalize factors, and consider additional technical indicators for robustness.
Incorporate adaptive lookback periods, additional technical indicators, and normalization for more robust and dynamic factors.
Optimize lookback periods, normalize factors, and consider multiplicative combinations for enhanced predictive power.
Consider varying lookback periods, combining multiple factors, and tuning weights based on historical performance.
Vary lookback periods, integrate more factors like RSI, and consider normalization for balanced factor contribution.
Incorporate weighted averages, use diverse time frames, and include factors like buying pressure and relative strength.
Use fixed, optimized lookback periods and combine factors multiplicatively for non-linear interactions.
Adjust weights, consider factor interactions, and explore additional technical indicators for improved predictive power.
Adjust lookback periods, normalize factors, and consider multiplicative combination for potentially better performance.
