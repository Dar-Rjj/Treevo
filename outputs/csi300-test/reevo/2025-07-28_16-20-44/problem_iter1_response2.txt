def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the average of the open and close prices, which can represent the central tendency of the day
    mid_point = (df['open'] + df['close']) / 2
    
    # Calculate the money flow ratio using the amount (dollar volume) and volume
    money_flow_ratio = df['amount'] / df['volume']
    
    # Create an interaction effect factor by combining the normalized distance from the low to the midpoint,
    # scaled by the money flow ratio.
    # The idea is that a higher mid-point in relation to the day's range, combined with strong money flow,
    # could be indicative of stronger demand.
    factor = ((mid_point - df['low']) / (df['high'] - df['low'] + 1e-7)) * money_flow_ratio
