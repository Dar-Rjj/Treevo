Incorporate dynamic lookback, adaptive weights, and normalization for robust and balanced factor contributions.
Adjust weights dynamically, use multiplicative combination, and conditionally apply based on factor performance.
Incorporate dynamic lookback, RSI, MACD; optimize factor weights through backtesting.
Vary lookback dynamically, normalize factors, and consider multiplicative combination for non-linear interactions.
Simplify factors, use consistent lookback periods, and apply exponential smoothing for recency bias.
Normalize factors, use adaptive lookback, and consider interactive effects between factors.
Incorporate adaptive weighting, use multiplicative combination, and consider additional technical or fundamental indicators.
Simplify, normalize, and focus on key timeframes for more interpretable and effective alpha factors.
Use fixed lookback periods, simplify normalization, and apply exponential decay for recency bias.
Incorporate adaptive windows, sector-specific factors, and machine learning for dynamic weight adjustments.
