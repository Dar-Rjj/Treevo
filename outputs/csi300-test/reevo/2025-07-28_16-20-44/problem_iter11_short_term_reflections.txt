Adjust window sizes, normalize factors, and consider additional indicators like RSI or MACD for enhanced predictive power.
Consider multi-period analysis, normalize factors, and incorporate intraday dynamics for more robust alpha generation.
Incorporate volatility, use exponential smoothing, and integrate macroeconomic indicators for enhanced predictive power.
Simplify factors, normalize inputs, stabilize division, and consider longer-term volatility for robustness.
Incorporate multiple time horizons, normalize factors, and include intraday dynamics for more robust alpha signals.
Incorporate more diverse time frames, use weighted averages, and consider additional factors like trading range and return skew.
Normalize factors and add small constant to divisor to avoid division by zero, enhancing stability.
Shorter momentum and sentiment windows, normalization, and combining factors effectively improved performance. Consider seasonality and volatility.
Incorporate more diverse indicators, weight factors by their predictive power, and use dynamic lookback periods.
Incorporate multiple time frames, normalize factors, and balance trend, liquidity, sentiment, and risk.
