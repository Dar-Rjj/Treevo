Integrate weighted, dynamic lookback periods and consider additional factors like trend strength and relative strength.
Incorporate dynamic lookbacks, weight factors by importance, and use log returns for smoother momentum.
Use fixed lookback, normalization, and multiplicative combination for more stable and interpretable alpha factors.
Normalize factors, use consistent lookback periods, and balance by equal weightage for more robust alpha generation.
Incorporate more technical indicators, use exponential smoothing, and balance factors with dynamic weighting.
Incorporate dynamic periods, weighted factors, and focus on log returns for improved predictive power.
Incorporate more technical indicators, optimize window sizes, and use advanced statistical methods for normalization.
Consider diverse time frames, normalize factors, and incorporate relative strength measures for robustness.
Incorporate more technical indicators, use dynamic weights, and consider sector-specific factors.
Incorporate dynamic lookbacks, focus on log returns, and adjust weights based on predictive power.
