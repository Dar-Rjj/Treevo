Focus on dynamic ratios, shorter-term trends, and volume-weighted factors for more responsive alpha signals.
Incorporate momentum, liquidity, and volatility. Use price levels, not just averages. Normalize and scale factors.
Incorporate multi-period analysis, price trends, and volume dynamics for more robust factor creation.
Incorporate trend, volume, and volatility; use rolling statistics and combine factors for a more robust signal.
Consider sector-specific factors, incorporate macroeconomic indicators, and use machine learning for dynamic factor weighting.
Incorporate more dynamic indicators, leverage unique ratios, and consider market microstructure for enhanced factor robustness.
Integrate more market dynamics, normalize factors, and consider multi-period trends for robustness.
Incorporate dynamic weighting, use percentage change for momentum, and consider liquidity and market sentiment.
Incorporate diverse factors, normalize, and combine them. Consider trend, liquidity, and sentiment for robustness.
Incorporate weighted averages, momentum, and liquidity measures; experiment with different time windows and market features.
