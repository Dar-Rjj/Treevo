```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate price momentum as the ratio of today's close to the 7-day moving average of close prices
    df['price_momentum'] = df['close'] / df['close'].rolling(window=7).mean()

    # Calculate the buying pressure as (high - close) / (high - low + 1e-7), indicating strength of buying relative to range
    df['buying_pressure'] = (df['high'] - df['close']) / (df['high'] - df['low'] + 1e-7)

    # The alpha factor is the product of price momentum and buying pressure, aiming to capture both trend and intraday strength
    alpha_factor = df['price_momentum'] * df['buying_pressure']

    return alpha_factor
