Use sector-specific lookbacks, adaptive weights, and consider additional factors like RSI and MACD for improved alpha generation.
Use exponential decay for smoothing, adaptive weights, and consider factor normalization.
Integrate sector-specific parameters, use dynamic lookback ranges, and normalize factors for balanced contribution.
Reduce redundancy, adjust lookback periods, and consider sector-specific, macroeconomic, or news-based factors for enhancement.
Simplify lookback, balance factor weights, and apply exponential decay for recency emphasis.
Consider sector-specific indicators, multi-period analysis, and external data for enhanced factor diversification and robustness.
Incorporate sector-specific data, normalize factors, and use multiplicative combination for improved factor stability and interpretability.
Simplify, focus on recent data, and apply exponential decay for more dynamic and responsive factors.
Incorporate dynamic lookbacks, sector-specific factors, and normalize for balanced contribution.
Use EMA for smoothing, diversify lookback periods, and consider multiplicative or adaptive weighting for factor combination.
