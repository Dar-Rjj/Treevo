```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate moving averages over different periods for close price
    ma_5 = df['close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    ma_10 = df['close'].rolling(window=10).mean()

    # Calculate the relative strength by comparing the short-term to long-term MA
    relative_strength = (ma_5 - ma_10) / ma_10

    # Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
    vwap = (df['volume'] * (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2).cumsum() / df['volume'].cumsum()

    # Calculate the divergence between the close price and VWAP
    vwap_divergence = (df['close'] - vwap) / vwap

    # Combine the relative strength and VWAP divergence into a single factor
    factor = relative_strength + vwap_divergence
