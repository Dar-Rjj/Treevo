```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the momentum factor using the log return over the last 10 days
    momentum = np.log(df['close']).diff(periods=10)
    
    # Calculate the liquidity factor using the average volume over the last 20 days
    liquidity = df['volume'].rolling(window=20).mean()
    
    # Calculate the market sentiment using the average money flow ratio over the last 5 days
    money_flow_ratio = df['amount'] / df['volume']
    market_sentiment = money_flow_ratio.rolling(window=5).mean()
    
    # Create a combined factor by multiplying the momentum, liquidity, and market sentiment
    # The idea is that stocks with positive momentum, high liquidity, and strong market sentiment may outperform
    factor = (momentum + 1) * liquidity * market_sentiment
    
    return factor
