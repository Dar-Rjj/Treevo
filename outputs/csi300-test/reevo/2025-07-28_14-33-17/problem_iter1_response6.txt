```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the average of open and close price
    avg_price = (df['open'] + df['close']) / 2
    
    # Calculate the difference between the average price and the low, high prices
    diff_low = avg_price - df['low']
    diff_high = df['high'] - avg_price
    
    # Calculate the volume weighted by the amount which may represent the financial flow
    volume_weighted_by_amount = df['volume'] * (df['amount'] / df['volume'].rolling(window=20).mean())
    
    # Calculate a novel factor: the sum of the differences between the average and low, high prices, normalized by the maximum of those two differences, then multiplied by the adjusted volume
    factor = ((diff_low + diff_high) / (diff_low + diff_high).max()) * volume_weighted_by_amount
