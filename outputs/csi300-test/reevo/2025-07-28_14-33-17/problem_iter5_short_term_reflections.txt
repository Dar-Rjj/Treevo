Incorporate more dynamic and market-aligned indicators, adjust weights, and consider multi-period analysis.
Incorporate more diverse data, use adaptive windows, and include market sentiment for improved heuristics.
Incorporate shorter rolling windows, use EMA for smoothing, and normalize by volatility for more dynamic and responsive factors.
Incorporate more sophisticated technical indicators, adjust for market conditions, and weigh by volume or other liquidity measures.
Incorporate more market dynamics, use advanced statistical methods, and consider multiple time frames for robustness.
Incorporate more dynamic and adaptive weights, add trend-following, and mean-reversion signals.
Incorporate more refined volatility measures and use adaptive, not fixed, lookback periods for dynamic market conditions.
Incorporate more diverse indicators, use adaptive windows, and consider market trends and sentiment for improvement.
Use exponential smoothing, focus on short-term dynamics, and combine signals with smoothed indicators for stability.
Focus on dynamic factors, use shorter periods for momentum, incorporate liquidity, and balance with inverse volatility.
