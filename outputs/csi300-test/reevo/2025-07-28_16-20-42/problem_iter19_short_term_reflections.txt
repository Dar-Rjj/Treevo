Simplify factors, use shorter-term SMAs, equal weights, and combine fewer, more relevant metrics.
Focus on shorter time frames, adaptive price weighting, and incorporate volume for improved signal robustness.
Integrate momentum, optimize weights, and consider longer-term trends for enhanced robustness.
Adapt weights, use shorter windows, incorporate volume, balance short and long trends.
Reduce complexity, remove long-term trends, focus on short-term dynamics and volume for sharper signals.
Refine weight calculations, incorporate more robust volatility measures, and consider longer-term trends for stability.
Shorter time frames, adaptive price weighting, and volume integration enhance factor responsiveness and robustness.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and avoid overcomplicating with too many factors.
Equal weights for price components, simplified factor combination, focus on mean reversion.
Use longer-term trends, fixed weights, and combine momentum and mean reversion for stability.
