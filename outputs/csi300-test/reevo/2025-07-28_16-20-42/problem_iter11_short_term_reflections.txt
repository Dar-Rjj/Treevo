Simplify weights, integrate momentum, use liquidity as volume/amount, and balance factors for robustness.
Adjust weights, incorporate volume, and consider longer-term trends for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Optimize weights, use shorter moving averages, and focus on volatility-adjusted price differences.
Consider seasonality, macroeconomic indicators, and cross-asset correlations for more robust alpha factors.
Simplify calculations, use consistent volatility measures, and focus on momentum and liquidity for more interpretable and effective alpha factors.
Integrate longer-term trends, normalize and adaptively weight factors, and include momentum for robustness.
Incorporate more diverse indicators, weight adjustments, and recent market dynamics for enhanced predictive power.
Integrate sector-specific trends, adapt liquidity factor, and use dynamic weights for price components.
Simplify calculations, use EMA momentum, and adjust for liquidity more precisely.
Incorporate adaptive weights, use multiple moving averages, and integrate momentum and liquidity for enhanced alpha factor.
