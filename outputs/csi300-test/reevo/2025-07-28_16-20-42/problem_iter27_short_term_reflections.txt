Integrate sentiment, use longer windows, apply machine learning, and optimize weights.
Incorporate adaptive weights, momentum, and trend factors; simplify and balance the final alpha factor.
Adaptive weights, focused metrics, and simplified combinations improve factor performance.
Consider liquidity, adaptive momentum, and trend strength for more robust and predictive alpha factors.
Consider dynamic weights, focus on short-term volatility, and balance with long-term trends for improved factor stability.
Incorporate adaptive weighting, longer-term volatility, and mean reversion for improved factor robustness.
Simplify, use dynamic thresholds, and integrate market microstructure for more robust and interpretable factors.
Incorporate dynamic weights, long-term trends, and balanced metric combinations for improved factor robustness.
Incorporate more adaptive weights, use multiple momentum periods, and include liquidity and trend strength factors.
Use dynamic weights, focus on short-term volatility, and balance with long-term trends.
