Incorporate adaptive weights, longer-term trends, and use EMA for smoother signals.
Shorter time frames, balanced price weighting, and simpler factor combinations can improve alpha factor performance.
Adjust weights, use longer-term SMAs, incorporate volume trends, and normalize factors for better stability and predictive power.
Simplify, use shorter time frames, fixed weights, and focus on volatility and mean reversion.
Shorter averaging periods, optimized weights, and fewer combined metrics can improve factor performance.
Incorporate longer-term trends, sector-specific data, and dynamic weighting for improved factor robustness.
Incorporate multiple time frames, use EMA for trends, and balance momentum with liquidity for robust alpha factors.
Consider shorter time frames, simpler weighted sums, and fewer combined metrics for more dynamic and responsive factors.
Use adaptive weights, longer-term trends, and incorporate mean reversion for improved factor performance.
Incorporate adaptive weights, use EMA for trends, and include realized volatility for dynamic risk assessment.
