Simplify, focus on key factors, use dynamic thresholds, and consider market microstructure for enhanced predictive power.
Focus on shorter timeframes, integrate momentum and mean reversion, and use weighted combinations.
Focus on dynamic volatility, adaptive smoothing, and integrate multi-period momentum for enhanced predictability.
Use adaptive weights, incorporate liquidity, and blend multiple momentum and mean reversion factors.
Incorporate more market dynamics, use adaptive weights, and explore different time frames for moving averages.
Incorporate more diverse momentum, liquidity, and adaptive volatility measures; optimize weights through backtesting.
Consider seasonality, market trends, and advanced statistical methods for more sophisticated alpha factor generation.
Simplify, use equal weights, focus on 3-day metrics, and balance components.
Adapt weights dynamically, integrate longer-term trends, and balance momentum with mean reversion.
Incorporate more sophisticated volatility measures and use multi-period momentum for enhanced predictive power.
