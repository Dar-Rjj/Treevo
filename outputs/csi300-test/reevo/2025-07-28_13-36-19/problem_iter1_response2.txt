```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the close and open prices (daily movement)
    daily_movement = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate the average of high and low as a proxy for the midpoint of the day's trading range
    midpoint = (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2
    
    # Calculate the ratio of amount to volume, which could act as a proxy for the average price per share
    avg_price_per_share = df['amount'] / df['volume']
    
    # Factor: Weighted difference between daily_movement and the distance from the closing price to the midpoint
    factor = daily_movement - 0.5 * (df['close'] - midpoint) + 0.3 * avg_price_per_share
    
    return factor
