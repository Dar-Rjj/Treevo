Simplify, focus on key factors, and use adaptive weights for dynamic market conditions.
Use EMA for smoother trends, dynamically adjust weights, and consider the impact of volatility on factor combination.
Adjust weights, consider longer windows, and explore additional features like market sentiment or macroeconomic indicators.
Consider dynamic weights, incorporate more price/volume ratios, and use advanced statistical measures for volatility.
Incorporate adaptive weights, use SMA for stability, and consider volatility for dynamic factor weighting.
Consider using EMA for smoother trends, and combine factors with dynamic weights based on their predictive power.
Incorporate adaptive weights, use rolling means for simplicity, and apply EMA for smoothing in your heuristics.
Incorporate adaptive weighting, use EMA for smoothing, and include recent volatility for dynamic factor adjustment.
Consider seasonality, use logarithmic returns, and incorporate market breadth indicators for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate adaptive weighting, use EMA for smoothing, and consider additional volatility measures for enhanced factor stability.
