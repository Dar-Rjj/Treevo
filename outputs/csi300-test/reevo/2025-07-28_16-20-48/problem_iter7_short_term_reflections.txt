Use exponential smoothing, incorporate volume-adjusted metrics, and combine with volatility measures for more robust factors.
Consider seasonality, incorporate macroeconomic indicators, and use machine learning for dynamic weighting.
Incorporate more dynamic volatility, use exponential smoothing, and blend momentum with volume and range indicators.
Incorporate adaptive weights, use SMA for momentum, and focus on relevant factors with exponential smoothing.
Incorporate more adaptive and dynamic features, use EMA for smoothing, and consider RSI for momentum.
Incorporate seasonality, sector performance, and macroeconomic indicators for enhanced predictive power.
Use exponential smoothing, focus on recent data, and simplify factor combinations for better predictive power.
Incorporate more dynamic volatility, use adaptive windows, and weigh factors by their predictive power.
Reduce complexity, focus on key indicators, and apply dynamic weighting based on market conditions.
Consider adaptive weights, incorporate volume and price ranges, and use exponential smoothing for more responsive factors.
