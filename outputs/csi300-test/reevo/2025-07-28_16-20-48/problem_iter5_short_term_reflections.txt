Incorporate longer-term trends, use volume-weighted prices, and normalize factors to improve signal clarity and robustness.
Reduce complexity, focus on recent data, and use consistent smoothing for more robust and interpretable factors.
Incorporate more dynamic and responsive metrics, like RSI and momentum, and use them in a balanced, averaged factor.
Incorporate more dynamic and adaptive factors, use exponential smoothing, and consider multi-factor integration with weighted averages.
Incorporate volatility, use exponential smoothing, and consider market trends for enhanced factor stability and predictive power.
Incorporate volatility, use more robust statistical measures, and consider inter-period relationships for smoother factors.
Incorporate adaptive volatility, use exponential smoothing, and integrate range ratios for enhanced factor stability and predictive power.
Incorporate more dynamic and market flow indicators, use smoothing for stability, and consider relative strength for robustness.
Incorporate volatility, use adaptive windows, and consider sector-specific multipliers for enhanced factor performance.
Refine volume adjustments, shorten averaging windows, and balance factor contributions for more responsive and accurate alpha signals.
