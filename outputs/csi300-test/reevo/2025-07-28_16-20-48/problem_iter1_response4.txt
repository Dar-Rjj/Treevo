```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close, then divide by today's volume
    momentum_adjusted = (df['close'].diff() / df['volume']).shift(1)
    # Calculate the weighted price using amount and volume to identify the money flow
    money_flow = (df['amount'] / df['volume']).rolling(window=3).mean()
    # Combine both factors with a simple moving average of 5 periods to smooth out the noise
    alpha_factor = ((momentum_adjusted + money_flow) / 2).rolling(window=5).mean()
    return alpha_factor
