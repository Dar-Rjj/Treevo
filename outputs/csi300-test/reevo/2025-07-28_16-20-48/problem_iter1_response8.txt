```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close, to capture the daily momentum
    daily_momentum = df['close'].diff().fillna(0)
    
    # Compute the ratio of the volume to the amount, which can be seen as a type of turnover
    volume_to_amount_ratio = df['volume'] / (df['amount'] + 1e-7)
    
    # Combine the two measures: momentum with a liquidity proxy
    factor_values = daily_momentum * volume_to_amount_ratio
    
    return factor_values
