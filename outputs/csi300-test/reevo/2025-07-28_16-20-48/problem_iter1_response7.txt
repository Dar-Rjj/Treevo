```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between high and low prices as a measure of daily price range
    daily_range = df['high'] - df['low']
    
    # Calculate the difference between close and open prices as a measure of daily price movement
    daily_movement = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Create a factor that scales the daily movement by the daily range
    # This factor indicates the relative size of the daily movement in the context of the daily range
    factor = daily_movement / (daily_range + 1e-7)
    
    return factor
