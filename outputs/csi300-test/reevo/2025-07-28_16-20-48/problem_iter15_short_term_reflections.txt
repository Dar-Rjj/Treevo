Incorporate macro trends, optimize weights, and use longer-term momentum for stability.
Simplify, use adaptive weights, focus on key indicators, and incorporate both short- and long-term signals.
Consider factor interactions, use adaptive smoothing, and explore alternative volatility measures for more robust alpha factors.
Integrate macroeconomic data, use dynamic weights, and smooth with EMA for more robust alpha factors.
Integrate more adaptive windows, use logarithmic returns, and adjust dynamic weights for improved factor responsiveness and robustness.
Consider seasonality, external indicators, and cross-asset correlations for enhanced alpha factor robustness.
Incorporate dynamic weights, macro indicators, and smooth with EMA for more robust and adaptive alpha factors.
Integrate cross-factor interactions, optimize weights, and consider market conditions for dynamic adjustments.
Simplify, use adaptive weights, non-linear transformations, and focus on key momentum and volume indicators.
Use dynamic weights, focus on key indicators, and incorporate longer-term momentum for more robust alpha factors.
