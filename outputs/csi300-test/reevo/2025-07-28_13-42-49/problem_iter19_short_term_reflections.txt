Incorporate dynamic weights, RSI, and seasonality; refine adaptive volume and mean reversion.
Integrate RSI, optimize weights, and consider additional indicators like MACD for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate dynamic weights, use quantile thresholds, and adjust factor contributions based on market conditions for better heuristics.
Optimize weights, adjust EWMA spans, and consider additional indicators like MACD for enhanced performance.
Equal weights for volume average, simplified factor without dynamic weights, and RSI might improve interpretability and performance.
Use EWMA, dynamic weights, and incorporate market sentiment for more adaptive and responsive alpha factors.
Balance dynamic weights, integrate market conditions, and simplify factor combinations for clearer signals.
Adjust weights dynamically based on market conditions and use balanced adaptive averages for volume.
Incorporate more dynamic weights, leverage EWMA for smoother indicators, and explore alternative sentiment measures.
