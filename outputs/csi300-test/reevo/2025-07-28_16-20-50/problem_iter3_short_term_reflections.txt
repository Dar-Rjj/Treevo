Consider rolling statistics, positive/negative signal separation, and robust normalization for more informative factors.
Incorporate volatility, leverage weighted averages, and normalize by price range for more robust factors.
Use rolling window calculations and incorporate volume for weighting, focus on price momentum and mean reversion.
Consider liquidity, momentum, and sentiment. Integrate multiple indicators, use rolling windows, and normalize data for robust factors.
Consider volume-weighted metrics, relative ratios, and longer-term trends for robust and interpretable factors.
Combine price action with volume, use meaningful averages, and incorporate momentum for more predictive power.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and trade intensity. Normalize and combine factors for robustness.
Incorporate directional volume, use cumulative sums, and leverage rolling windows for smoothing.
Consider volatility, trend strength, and liquidity. Integrate multi-period returns and volume for more robust signals.
Incorporate volatility, moving averages, and relative strength for more robust alpha signals.
