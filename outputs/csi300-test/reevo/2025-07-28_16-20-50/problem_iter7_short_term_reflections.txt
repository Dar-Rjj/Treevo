Incorporate VWAP, SMA for various periods, and blend momentum with mean reversion for robustness.
Incorporate multiple timeframes, use relative changes, and combine diverse indicators for a robust factor.
Incorporate multi-period trends, use VWAP, and consider price extremes for more robust and interpretable factors.
Incorporate long-term trends, weighted averages, and relative position within historical ranges.
Consider directional volume, use rolling windows, and normalize factors to improve signal-to-noise ratio.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use VWAP, and balance multiple financial indicators for robustness.
Incorporate multi-period VWAPs, SMAs, and integrate both momentum and mean reversion for balanced signals.
Incorporate more price and volume trends, use weighted averages, and balance momentum with mean reversion.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use VWAP, and consider distance from historical highs and lows for robustness.
Incorporate multi-period VWAPs, SMAs, and both momentum and mean reversion for balanced, robust factors.
