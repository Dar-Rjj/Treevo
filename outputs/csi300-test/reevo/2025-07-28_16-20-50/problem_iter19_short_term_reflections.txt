Consider longer windows, integrate more diverse factors, and dynamically adjust weights based on market conditions.
Incorporate more dynamic factors, use shorter windows, and adjust weights based on factor performance.
Incorporate more diverse factors, use exponential smoothing, and optimize adaptive weights.
Incorporate more diverse factors, use exponential smoothing, and fine-tune adaptive weighting for improved performance.
Adjust factor weights, consider mean reversion over a longer period, and refine adaptive weighting for improved performance.
Shorten rolling windows, use adaptive weighting, and focus on recent market data for more dynamic factors.
Adjust window sizes, use adaptive weights, and incorporate short-term trends for more responsive and accurate alpha factors.
Increase window sizes, apply non-linear transformations, and optimize adaptive weighting for enhanced factor performance.
Longer windows, adaptive weights, and balanced factor contributions improve alpha factor effectiveness.
Incorporate more dynamic factors, like order book imbalances, and use machine learning for adaptive weighting.
