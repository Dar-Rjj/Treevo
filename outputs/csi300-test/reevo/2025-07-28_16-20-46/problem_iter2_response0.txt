    df['SMA_5'] = df['close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    df['SMA_20'] = df['close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

    # Calculate the Relative Strength (RS) as the ratio of the current close to the 20-day SMA
    df['RS'] = df['close'] / df['SMA_20']

    # Calculate the price change and volume change
    df['price_change'] = df['close'].pct_change()
    df['volume_change'] = df['volume'].pct_change()

    # Calculate the volatility as the standard deviation of the last 5 days' closing prices
    df['volatility'] = df['close'].rolling(window=5).std()

    # Normalize the RS by the volatility
    df['normalized_RS'] = df['RS'] / (df['volatility'] + 1e-7)

    # Combine the normalized RS, price change, and volume change to form the alpha factor
    df['alpha_factor'] = (df['normalized_RS'] + df['price_change'] + 2 * df['volume_change']) / 4
