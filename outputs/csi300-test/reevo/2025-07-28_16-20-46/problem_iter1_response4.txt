```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between today's and yesterday's close
    df['price_diff'] = df['close'].diff()
    # Calculate the 5-day moving average of the price difference
    df['price_diff_5d_sma'] = df['price_diff'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    # Calculate the 10-day standard deviation of the price difference
    df['price_diff_10d_std'] = df['price_diff'].rolling(window=10).std()
    # Factor: ratio of 5-day momentum to 10-day volatility
    factor = df['price_diff_5d_sma'] / (df['price_diff_10d_std'] + 1e-7)
    return factor
