Leverage EMA for smoother trends, use entropy-pooled weights, and simplify factor combinations.
Incorporate more sophisticated trend and volume dynamics, and use non-linear transformations for factor combination.
Use simpler price measures, incorporate EMA for smoothing, and normalize final factor for better performance.
Incorporate more volume-weighted metrics, use EMA for smoothing, and consider fewer non-linear transformations.
Simplify, focus on key factors, and use adaptive weighting for a more robust and interpretable alpha factor.
Incorporate more sophisticated statistical measures and use dynamic, volatility-adjusted weights for factors.
Integrate sector performance, use more sophisticated volatility measures, and consider macroeconomic indicators.
Consider incorporating mean reversion, more robust volatility measures, and advanced volume indicators.
Focus on EMA for smoother trends, use entropy-pooled weights, and simplify factor combinations for clarity and effectiveness.
Integrate more market dynamics, like sentiment or macroeconomic data, and experiment with different weighting schemes.
