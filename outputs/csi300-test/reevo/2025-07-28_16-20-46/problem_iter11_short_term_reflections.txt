Consider integrating volume-weighted price, and use more sophisticated weighting schemes like entropy pooling.
Use EMA for smoother trends, adaptive weights, and consider adding macroeconomic indicators.
Use EMA for smoother trends, include price and volume changes, and rank-based adaptive weights for dynamic factor integration.
Incorporate dynamic weights, trend, and volume factors; use SMA for momentum to improve stability and interpretability.
Incorporate trend confirmation, dynamic weight adjustments, and consider using more advanced statistical or machine learning techniques.
Incorporate dynamic weights, use advanced statistical measures, and integrate EMAs for recent data emphasis.
Incorporate dynamic weighting, use percentage changes, and avoid overcomplicating with non-linear transformations.
Incorporate dynamic trend and volume adjustments, use simpler moving averages, and avoid overcomplicating with non-linear transformations.
Incorporate more dynamic factors, use weighted moving averages, and consider sector-specific trends.
Incorporate more sophisticated technical indicators and adaptive weighting schemes for enhanced predictive power.
