Consider volatility, moving averages, and relative strength for more robust and dynamic alpha factor generation.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and liquidity; use rolling windows, rank, and normalize factors.
Incorporate trends, smooth noise, and balance momentum with volatility for robustness.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and smooth out noise with moving averages for more robust signals.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and volume with adaptive weighting; consider market context and liquidity.
Incorporate volatility, leverage weighted sums, and consider multi-period trends for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate momentum, use normalized ratios, and consider multi-period analysis for stability.
Integrate more market dynamics, use relative changes, and experiment with different weights and lags.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and smoothing techniques. Consider multi-day trends and normalize to handle fluctuations.
Consider trend strength, volume impact, and price action consistency for more robust alpha factors.
