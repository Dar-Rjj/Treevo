Synthesized High-Low and Price Momentum with Volume-Weighted Adjustment and Confirmation
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted High-Low Range
│   ├── Loop through past 10 days
│   │   └── Multiply each (High - Low) by its corresponding Volume
│   └── Divide by the sum of Volumes over the past 10 days
├── Adjust for Market Sentiment
│   ├── Subtract Open from Close
│   └── Modify Volume-Weighted High-Low Range based on Market Sentiment
│       ├── If Close-to-Open Return is positive, increase the score
│       └── If Close-to-Open Return is negative, decrease the score
├── Smoothing High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High and Low prices to calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Apply Simple Moving Average (SMA) on High-Low Spread
│   │   └── Define SMA period
│   └── Subtract SMA from Current High-Low Spread
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute Close-to-Close Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price (t)
│   │   └── Use Close price (t-n)
│   └── Sum over n periods
├── Confirm with Trading Volume Increase
│   ├── Check if Volume (t) > Volume (t-1)
│   │   └── Assign 1 if true, else 0
├── Final Alpha Factor Construction
│   ├── Combine Adjusted Volume-Weighted High-Low Range and High-Low Spread
│   │   ├── Multiply Adjusted Volume-Weighted High-Low Range by Volume Indicator
│   │   └── Multiply Smoothed High-Low Spread by Volume Indicator
│   ├── Combine Price Momentum
│   │   ├── Multiply Price Momentum by Volume Indicator
│   └── Aggregate the Combined Factors
└── Output the Resulting Alpha Factor
