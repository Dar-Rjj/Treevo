Integrated and Enhanced Crossover of Price-Volume Dynamics, High-Low Spread Adjustments, and Trend Confirmation
├── Calculate Composite Price-Volume Momentum
│   ├── Compute Close-to-Close Return: (Close(t) - Close(t-1))
│   └── Sum over n periods
├── Confirm with Trading Volume Increase
│   ├── If Volume(t) > Volume(t-1), assign 1, else 0
│   └── Multiply Momentum by Volume Indicator
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted High-Low Range
│   ├── Loop through past 10 days
│   │   └── Sum (High - Low) * Volume
│   └── Divide by the sum of Volumes over the past 10 days
├── Adjust for Market Sentiment
│   ├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return: (Close - Open)
│   └── Modify Volume-Weighted High-Low Range based on Market Sentiment
│       ├── If Close-to-Open Return is positive, increase the score
│       └── If Close-to-Open Return is negative, decrease the score
├── Smoothing High-Low Spread
│   ├── Apply Simple Moving Average (SMA) on High-Low Spread
│   │   └── Define SMA period as 10 days
│   └── Subtract SMA from Current High-Low Spread
├── Integrate with Convergence-Divergence of High-Low Prices
│   ├── Calculate Short Term Moving Average of High and Low: 5-day MA
│   ├── Calculate Long Term Moving Average of High and Low: 20-day MA
│   └── Subtract Long Term MA from Short Term MA
├── Filter by Volume Change
│   ├── If Volume Change > 0
│   │   └── Keep Integrated Factors
│   └── If Volume Change <= 0
│       └── Discard Integrated Factors
├── Trend Confirmation
│   ├── Calculate 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
│   └── Determine if 5-day SMA is above or below 20-day SMA
│       ├── If 5-day SMA is above 20-day SMA, assign 1
│       └── If 5-day SMA is below 20-day SMA, assign 0
├── Calculate Enhanced High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Incorporate Convergence Divergence of High-Low Prices
│   ├── Calculate Short Term Moving Average of High and Low
│   │   └── Compute Rolling Mean over 5 Days
│   ├── Calculate Long Term Moving Average of High and Low
│   │   └── Compute Rolling Mean over 20 Days
│   └── Subtract Long Term MA from Short Term MA
├── Combine Momentum and Volume Indicators
│   ├── Multiply Combined Momentum by Volume Filter Indicator
│   └── Check if Volume is Increasing
│       ├── If Volume (t) > Volume (t-n)
│       │   └── Assign 1, else 0
└── Final Alpha Factor Construction
    ├── Combine Adjusted Volume-Weighted High-Low Range and Smoothed High-Low Spread
    ├── Combine Price Momentum
    ├── Add Convergence-Divergence of High-Low Prices
    └── Multiply combined factors by Trend Confirmation
