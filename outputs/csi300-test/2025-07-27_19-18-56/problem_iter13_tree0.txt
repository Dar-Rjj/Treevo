Synthesized High-Low and Price Momentum with Volume-Weighted Adjustment
├── Volume-Weighted High-Low Range
│   ├── Loop through past 10 days
│   │   └── Multiply each (High - Low) by its corresponding Volume
│   └── Divide by the sum of Volumes over the past 10 days
├── Adjust for Market Sentiment
│   ├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return: (Close - Open)
│   └── Modify Volume-Weighted High-Low Range based on Market Sentiment
│       ├── If Close-to-Open Return is positive, increase the score
│       └── If Close-to-Open Return is negative, decrease the score
├── Smoothed High-Low Spread
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Spread: (High - Low)
│   └── Subtract Simple Moving Average (SMA) from Current High-Low Spread
│       └── Define SMA period
├── Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute Close-to-Close Return: (Close(t) - Close(t-n))
│   └── Sum over n periods
├── Trading Volume Increase Indicator
│   ├── Check if Volume (t) > Volume (t-1)
│   │   └── Assign 1 if true, else 0
└── Final Alpha Factor Construction
    ├── Combine Adjusted Volume-Weighted High-Low Range and Smoothed High-Low Spread
