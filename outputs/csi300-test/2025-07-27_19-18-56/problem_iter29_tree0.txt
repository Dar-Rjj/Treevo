Integrated and Enhanced Crossover of Price-Volume Dynamics, High-Low Spread Adjustments, and Trend Confirmation
├── Calculate Close-to-Close Return
│   ├── Use Close price (t)
│   └── Use Close price (t-1)
├── Compute Composite Momentum
│   ├── Sum Close-to-Close Returns over n periods
│   └── Multiply by Volume Indicator: 1 if Volume (t) > Volume (t-1), else 0
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted High-Low Range
│   ├── Loop through past 10 days
│   │   └── Multiply each (High - Low) by its corresponding Volume
│   └── Divide by the sum of Volumes over the past 10 days
├── Adjust for Market Sentiment
│   ├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return: (Close - Open)
│   └── Modify Volume-Weighted High-Low Range
│       ├── Increase if Close-to-Open Return is positive
│       └── Decrease if Close-to-Open Return is negative
├── Smoothed High-Low Spread
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Spread: (High - Low)
│   └── Subtract EMA from Current High-Low Spread
│       └── Define EMA period
├── Integrate with Convergence-Divergence
│   ├── Short Term MA: 5-day Rolling Mean of (High + Low) / 2
│   ├── Long Term MA: 20-day Rolling Mean of (High + Low) / 2
│   └── Subtract Long Term MA from Short Term MA
├── Filter by Volume Change
│   ├── If Volume Change > 0
│   │   └── Keep Integrated Momentum and High-Low Spread
│   └── If Volume Change <= 0
│       └── Discard Integrated Momentum and High-Low Spread
├── Trend Confirmation
│   ├── 5-day SMA
│   ├── 20-day SMA
│   └── Assign 1 if 5-day SMA > 20-day SMA, else 0
└── Final Alpha Factor Construction
    ├── Combine Adjusted Volume-Weighted High-Low Range and Smoothed High-Low Spread
