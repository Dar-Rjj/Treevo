Simplify indicators, focus on momentum and VWAP, integrate with trend, and avoid overcomplicating with multiple velocities.
Simplify momentum, focus on VWAP, and enhance with intraday trend for clearer signals.
Incorporate VWAP, logarithmic returns, and intraday trends for enhanced predictive power.
Integrate volume changes more directly with price dynamics for enhanced synchronization.
Incorporate dynamic lookbacks, average true range, and price-volume velocities for enhanced factor robustness.
Incorporate intraday price dynamics, volume synchronization, and trend strength for enhanced alpha factor.
Incorporate more volume and price dynamics, and consider logarithmic changes for smoother trends.
Incorporate volatility, leverage VWAP, and align volume changes with price movements for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate more intraday dynamics, use volume-weighted metrics, and integrate with trend-following elements.
Simplify momentum, integrate VWAP, and enhance with trend for clearer, more effective alpha signals.
