Incorporate volatility, use dynamic lookback periods, and integrate multiple price and volume derivatives.
Integrate long and short-term momentum, adjust with volume ratios, and consider price volatility for robustness.
Integrate price and volume dynamics, leverage logarithmic transformations, and focus on intraday momentum for enhanced factor performance.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use volume-weighted averages, and consider relative strength for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate intraday dynamics, use volume-weighted metrics, and synchronize volume and price movements for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate relative changes, use previous day's open for normalization, and simplify calculations for clearer signals.
Incorporate volatility, use multi-period returns, and normalize by volume for robustness.
Integrate more dynamic price and volume interactions, consider volatility, and use rolling windows for adaptability.
Incorporate volatility, use dynamic lookback periods, and integrate more price and volume derivatives.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use momentum, and adjust with volume for more robust signals.
