Incorporate volatility, liquidity, and market sentiment metrics for improved predictive power.
Incorporate volatility, use longer rolling windows, and consider volume trends for improvement.
Simplify calculations, extend lookback periods, and directly integrate key indicators for clearer, more robust signals.
Integrate more price and volume derivatives, consider market microstructure, and optimize factor combination weights.
Increase lookback period for smoother trends; focus on integrating momentum and volume more effectively.
Incorporate multi-period relative strength, refine intraday momentum, and integrate volume dynamics for enhanced factor performance.
Focus on shorter-term trends, integrate volume with price momentum, and emphasize recent relative strength.
Leverage longer rolling windows and avoid over-adjustment for volatility and trading range.
Simplify calculations, focus on key indicators, and avoid overcomplicating the factor with too many components.
Incorporate longer rolling windows, simplify integration steps, and remove volatility for clearer factor signals.
