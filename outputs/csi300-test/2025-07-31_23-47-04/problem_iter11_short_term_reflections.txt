Incorporate volatility, leverage log returns, and refine volume integration for enhanced predictive power.
Focus on clear, direct calculations; integrate price and volume more coherently; simplify factor combinations.
Refine momentum, integrate precise volume changes, and enhance with trend for a more predictive alpha factor.
Refine volume and price integration, simplify calculations, and emphasize intraday trends for clearer signals.
Focus on integrating precise price and volume dynamics, emphasizing logarithmic returns and intraday trends.
Focus on clear, stepwise calculations and meaningful integration of momentum, volume, and price trends.
Incorporate more volume and price trends, use relative strength, and consider market sentiment for improved alpha generation.
Integrate momentum and volume, then enhance with price trend; avoid overcomplicating the final factor.
Simplify calculations, integrate direct price and volume relationships, and emphasize recent momentum.
Focus on integrating momentum, volume changes, and intraday trends for enhanced predictive power.
