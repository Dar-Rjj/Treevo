High-Low Range Momentum Alpha
├── Calculate High-Low Price Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High to get Range
├── Compute Average High-Low Range over a Lookback Period
│   ├── Use the High-Low Price Range
│   └── Set a Lookback Window (e.g., 14 days)
│       └── Sum the High-Low Price Ranges and Divide by the Number of Days in the Lookback Window
├── Calculate Deviation from Average High-Low Range
│   ├── Use the High-Low Price Range
│   └── Use the Average High-Low Range
│       └── Subtract the Average High-Low Range from the Current High-Low Price Range
├── Identify Positive and Negative Deviations
│   ├── If Deviation is Positive, Indicate Upward Momentum
│   │   └── Assign a Positive Score (e.g., 1)
│   └── If Deviation is Negative, Indicate Downward Momentum
│       └── Assign a Negative Score (e.g., -1)
└── Weight by Close-to-Open Return
    ├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
    │   ├── Use Close price
    │   └── Use Open price
    │       └── Subtract Open from Close, then Divide by Open
    └── Multiply the Momentum Score by the Close-to-Open Return
        └── Final Alpha Factor: Weighted Momentum Score
