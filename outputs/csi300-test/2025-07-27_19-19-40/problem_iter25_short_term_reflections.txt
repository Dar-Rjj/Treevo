Incorporate volume, adjust window size for trends, and consider volatility for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate multiple time frames, use volume as a scaling factor, and balance momentum with mean reversion.
Incorporate multi-period analysis, combine mean reversion and momentum, and utilize volume for scaling.
Consider volatility, incorporate volume-smoothed indicators, and test different window lengths for rolling calculations.
