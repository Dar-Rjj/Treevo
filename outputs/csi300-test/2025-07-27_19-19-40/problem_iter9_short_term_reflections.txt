Incorporate trend, volatility, and relative volume; avoid simple differences, use rolling statistics for smoother, more robust factors.
Focus on trend, volatility, and momentum. Simplify factors, avoid over-combining, and use normalized measures for better interpretability.
Incorporate rolling statistics, capture trend and volatility, and scale by relative volume for more robust alpha factors.
Integrate longer-term trends, use normalized indicators, and consider price and volume shock ratios.
