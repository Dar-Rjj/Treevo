Incorporate more price differences, use volume-adjusted returns, and consider multi-day momentum for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate volume-weighted price gaps and multi-day momentum for more robust factor generation.
Incorporate longer-term trends, enhance normalization, and consider volume changes for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate volatility, integrate longer-term trends, and use adaptive normalization for improved robustness.
Integrate volatility, incorporate sector-specific trends, and adjust for market capitalization.
Incorporate relative strength, volatility, and liquidity measures; simplify calculations; use lagged data for stability.
Incorporate volume-weighted average price, market depth, and volatility clustering for enhanced momentum and gap factors.
Integrate volatility, use exponential moving averages, and consider market breadth for enhanced alpha generation.
Incorporate price gaps, use volume-weighted momentum, and focus on high-to-low price movements for improved factor performance.
Incorporate more price dynamics, use volume cautiously, and include momentum with range for robustness.
