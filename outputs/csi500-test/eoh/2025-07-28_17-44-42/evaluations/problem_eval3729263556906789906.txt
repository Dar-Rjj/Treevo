importance or interaction, often using moving averages and momentum/volatility measures to capture trends and stability.

{The new algorithm computes a factor by integrating the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the closing price, the 20-day standard deviation of daily returns as a measure of volatility, and the 10-day cumulative sum of the difference between the opening and closing prices.}

```python
import pandas as pd

def heuristics_v2(df):
    sma_close_50 = df['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    returns = df['close'].pct_change()
    volatility_20 = returns.rolling(window=20).std()
    cum_sum_diff_10 = (df['open'] - df['close']).rolling(window=10).sum()
    
    heuristics_matrix = sma_close_50 + volatility_20 + cum_sum_diff_10
    return heuristics_matrix
