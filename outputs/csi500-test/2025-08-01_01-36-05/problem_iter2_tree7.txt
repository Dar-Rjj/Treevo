Price Momentum and Volume-Adjusted High-Low Ratio
├── Calculate Daily Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute Simple Moving Average of Close Price (SMA)
│   │   ├── Use Close price for the past 14 days
│   └── Subtract SMA from Current Close Price to get Momentum
├── Calculate High-Low Price Ratio
│   ├── Use High price
│   ├── Use Low price
│   │   ├── Compute (High / Low) - 1 to get the percentage change
└── Adjust by Volume and Momentum
    ├── Use Volume
    ├── Compute Rolling Sum of Volume over 5 days
    │   ├── If today is t, use volume from (t-4) to (t)
    ├── Multiply the high-low ratio by the rolling sum of volume
    └── Add Daily Price Momentum to the adjusted high-low ratio
