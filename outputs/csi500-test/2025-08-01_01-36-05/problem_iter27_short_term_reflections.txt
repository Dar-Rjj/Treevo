Incorporate more price levels, use adaptive smoothing, and consider sector-specific volatility.
Consider shorter lookback periods, consistent smoothing factors, and normalization for improved factor performance.
Consider longer lookback periods, use exponential smoothing, and normalize final factor for improved performance.
Incorporate dynamic smoothing, reduce lookback for volatility, and adjust based on recent market conditions.
Incorporate recent momentum, avoid normalization, and use exponential weighting for more reactive signals.
Shorter lookback periods and higher smoothing factors improve responsiveness and performance.
Incorporate adaptive smoothing, shorten volatility window, and consider market conditions for dynamic factor adjustments.
Increase smoothing factor, extend volatility window, and consider more recent volatility for better performance.
Shorter lookback, focused recent volatility, and consistent smoothing factor improve factor performance.
Consider longer volatility windows, fixed EMA smoothing, and normalizing final factors for consistency.
