Refine feature selection, adjust weighting, and optimize averaging periods for enhanced performance.
Focus on smoother volatility, utilize EMA for stability, and integrate volume more effectively.
Leverage shorter-term EMAs and SMAs, integrate volume earlier, and focus on momentum and volatility.
Simplify calculations, use consistent averaging methods, and integrate volume more effectively.
Incorporate shorter time frames, use exponential smoothing, and focus on volume-weighted returns for improved factor responsiveness.
Consider using simple moving averages for volatility and incorporating more recent data for adaptive factors.
Simplify calculations, use SMA for stability, and focus on volume-weighted returns for enhanced signal.
Incorporate adaptive components, use exponential moving averages, and integrate recent volatility for more dynamic factor adjustments.
Incorporate more recent data, use weighted averages, and integrate market sentiment for enhanced predictive power.
Shorten lookback periods, use exponential moving averages, and combine volume-weighted momentum with volatility.
