Incorporate price trends, enhance volatility adjustments, and normalize final factor for improved performance.
Increase lookback periods, adjust smoothing factors, and focus on recent volatility for improved factor performance.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use EMA for smoothing, and consider normalizing final factors for better stability.
Optimize smoothing factors, dynamically weight contributions, and consider shorter volatility windows for more responsive factors.
Integrate longer-term trends, use adaptive smoothing, and consider volume changes for enhanced signals.
Shorter lookback periods and lower smoothing factors improve factor responsiveness and performance.
Simplify, extend lookback periods, use consistent smoothing, and balance without overcomplicating.
Consider longer lookback periods, use volume-weighted returns, and blend EMAs with SMAs for smoother factor adjustments.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use both EMA and SMA, and adjust for recent volatility more dynamically.
Incorporate dynamic weighting, liquidity, and market depth for improved factor performance.
