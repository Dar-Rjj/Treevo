Price Momentum with Volume-Adjusted Volatility, Market Trend Alignment, and Liquidity Measures
├── Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Define the Lookback Period for SMA (e.g., 20 days)
├── Compute Volume-Adjusted Volatility
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Price Difference
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Use Low price
│   └── Apply Volume Weighting
│       ├── Use Volume
│       └── Multiply by High-Low Price Difference
│       └── Calculate the Rolling Average of the Volume-Weighted High-Low Differences
│           ├── Define the Lookback Period for the Rolling Average (e.g., 10 days)
├── Compute Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract the Simple Moving Average from the Current Close Price
│   └── Divide by the Average of the Last N Close Prices (e.g., 20 days)
├── Incorporate Additional Price Change Metrics
│   ├── Calculate the Percentage Change in Close Price
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Define the Lookback Period for Percentage Change (e.g., 5 days)
│   └── Calculate the High-Low Range
│       ├── Use High price
│       └── Use Low price
├── Consider Market Trend Alignment
│   ├── Calculate Long-Term SMA
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Define a Longer Lookback Period (e.g., 200 days)
│   └── Determine the Market Trend
│       ├── Compare the Current SMA to the Long-Term SMA
│       └── Assign a Trend Indicator (Bullish if Current SMA > Long-Term SMA, Bearish otherwise)
├── Incorporate Liquidity Measures
│   ├── Calculate Daily Turnover
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate the Rolling Average of Daily Turnover
│       ├── Define the Lookback Period for the Rolling Average (e.g., 30 days)
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Price Momentum, Volume-Adjusted Volatility, Additional Price Change Metrics, Market Trend Indicator, and Liquidity Measures
    │   ├── Use a Weighted Sum of the Components
    │   │   ├── Define the Weights for Each Component (e.g., 0.4 for Price Momentum, 0.3 for Volume-Adjusted Volatility, 0.1 for Additional Price Change Metrics, 0.1 for Market Trend, 0.1 for Liquidity)
    │   │   └── Ensure the Weights Sum to 1
    │   ├── Adjust Weights Based on Market Trend
    │   │   ├── Increase Weight for Bullish Trends (e.g., increase Price Momentum weight by 0.1)
    │   │   └── Decrease Weight for Bearish Trends (e.g., decrease Price Momentum weight by 0.1)
    │   ├── Adjust Weights Based on Liquidity
    │   │   ├── Increase Weight for Higher Liquidity (e.g., increase Volume-Adjusted Volatility weight by 0.1)
    │   │   └── Decrease Weight for Lower Liquidity (e.g., decrease Volume-Adjusted Volatility weight by 0.1)
    └── Output the Result as the Alpha Factor
