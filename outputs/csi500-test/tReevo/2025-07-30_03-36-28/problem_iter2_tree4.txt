Price Momentum with Volume-Adjusted Volatility and Dynamic Lookback
├── Calculate Dynamic Simple Moving Average of Close Prices
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Define the Dynamic Lookback Period
│       ├── Calculate 10-Day Price Variance
│       │   ├── Use Close price
│       │   └── Compute Rolling Variance over 10 days
│       └── Adjust Lookback Based on Variance
│           ├── If Variance is High, Use Shorter Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│           └── If Variance is Low, Use Longer Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
└── Compute Volume-Adjusted Volatility
    ├── Calculate High-Low Price Difference
    │   ├── Use High price
    │   └── Use Low price
    │       └── Subtract Low from High
    └── Apply Volume Weighting
        ├── Use Volume
        └── Multiply by High-Low Price Difference
├── Compute Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract the Dynamic Simple Moving Average from the Current Close Price
│   └── Normalize by the Average of the Last N Close Prices
│       ├── Use Close price
│       └── Compute Average of the Last N Close Prices
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Divide the Price Momentum by the Volume-Adjusted Volatility
    └── Output the Result as the Alpha Factor
