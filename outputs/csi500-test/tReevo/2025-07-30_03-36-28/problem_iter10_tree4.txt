Price Momentum with Volume-Adjusted Volatility and Diverse Metrics
├── Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Define the Lookback Period for SMA (e.g., 50 days)
├── Compute Volume-Adjusted Volatility
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Price Difference
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Use Low price
│   └── Apply Volume Weighting
│       ├── Use Volume
│       └── Multiply by High-Low Price Difference
│       └── Calculate the Rolling Average of the Volume-Weighted High-Low Differences
│           └── Define the Lookback Period for Rolling Average (e.g., 30 days)
├── Compute Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract the Simple Moving Average from the Current Close Price
│   └── Divide by the Average of the Last N Close Prices
│       └── Define N for the Average (e.g., 20 days)
├── Incorporate Additional Price Change Metrics
│   ├── Calculate the Percentage Change in Close Price
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Define the Lookback Period for Percentage Change (e.g., 10 days)
│   ├── Calculate the High-Low Range
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Use Low price
│   └── Compute the Rolling Standard Deviation of the High-Low Range
│       └── Define the Lookback Period for Rolling Standard Deviation (e.g., 40 days)
├── Calculate Dynamic Weights for Robustness
│   ├── Define a Dynamic Weighting Scheme
│   │   ├── Use a Function to Adjust Weights Based on Market Conditions (e.g., Volatility, Trend)
│   │   └── Define Parameters for the Dynamic Weighting Function
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Price Momentum, Volume-Adjusted Volatility, and Additional Price Change Metrics
    │   ├── Use a Weighted Sum of the Components with Dynamic Weights
    │   └── Define Initial Weights for Each Component (e.g., 0.4 for Price Momentum, 0.3 for Volume-Adjusted Volatility, 0.15 for Percentage Change, 0.15 for Rolling Standard Deviation of the High-Low Range)
    └── Output the Result as the Alpha Factor
