Price Momentum with Volume-Adjusted Volatility and Dynamic Lookback Periods
├── Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Define the Dynamic Lookback Period for SMA
│       ├── Calculate the Rolling Standard Deviation of Close Prices
│       │   ├── Use Close price
│       │   └── Define a Base Lookback Period
│       └── Adjust the Lookback Period Based on Market Volatility
│           ├── Use the Rolling Standard Deviation to Determine High or Low Volatility
│           └── Adjust the Lookback Period Shorter in High Volatility, Longer in Low Volatility
├── Compute Volume-Adjusted Volatility
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Price Difference
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Use Low price
│   └── Apply Volume Weighting
│       ├── Use Volume
│       └── Multiply by High-Low Price Difference
│   └── Calculate the Rolling Average of the Volume-Weighted High-Low Differences
│       ├── Use the Adjusted Lookback Period from SMA Calculation
│       └── Ensure the Lookback Period is Responsive to Market Conditions
├── Compute Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract the Simple Moving Average from the Current Close Price
│   └── Divide by the Sum of the Last N Close Prices
│       ├── Use the Adjusted Lookback Period from SMA Calculation
│       └── Ensure the Lookback Period is Responsive to Market Conditions
├── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Divide the Price Momentum by the Volume-Adjusted Volatility
    └── Output the Result as the Alpha Factor
