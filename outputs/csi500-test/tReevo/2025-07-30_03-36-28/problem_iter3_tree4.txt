Price Momentum with Volume-Adjusted Volatility
├── Calculate Simple Moving Average of Close Prices
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Define the Lookback Period (e.g., 20 days)
├── Compute Volume-Adjusted Volatility
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Price Difference
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Use Low price
│   └── Apply Volume Weighting
│       ├── Use Volume
│       └── Multiply by High-Low Price Difference
│       └── Sum the Volume-Weighted High-Low Differences over the Lookback Period
│       └── Divide by the Sum of Volumes over the Lookback Period
├── Compute Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract the Simple Moving Average from the Current Close Price
│   └── Normalize by the Average of the Last N Close Prices (e.g., 20 days)
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Divide the Price Momentum by the Volume-Adjusted Volatility
    └── Output the Result as the Alpha Factor
