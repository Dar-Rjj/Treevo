Simplify factors, focus on momentum and volatility, remove less predictive components like bid-ask spread.
Consider using more robust price differences and normalize momentum with average prices for better factor stability.
Focus on integrating volume-weighted volatility and momentum, avoiding over-complexity.
Simplify factors, focus on robust volatility measures, and remove less predictive market dynamics.
Focus on simpler, more direct relationships between price, volume, and momentum, avoiding over-complexity.
Simplify factors, use true range for volatility, and standard deviation for normalization in momentum.
Incorporate more price change metrics and refine volatility with dynamic volume adjustments for enhanced factor performance.
Focus on true range, avoid over-normalization, and simplify integration for more robust and interpretable alpha factors.
Incorporate more volume-weighted metrics and adjust lookback periods dynamically for improved responsiveness.
Incorporate true range for volatility, and normalize momentum with standard deviation for more robust signals.
