Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and Deviation-Based Alpha Factor with Volatility Integration and Dynamic Thresholds
├── Calculate Daily VWAP
│   ├── Sum of (Volume * Close Price)
│   └── Divide by Total Volume
│       └── Sum of Day's Volumes
├── Calculate VWAP Deviation
│   ├── Subtract VWAP from Close Price
├── Calculate Cumulative VWAP Deviation
│   ├── Add VWAP Deviation to Previous Day's Cumulative VWAP Deviation
│   └── Initialize with 0 on the first day
├── Integrate Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Daily Volatility
│   │   ├── Obtain High and Low Prices
│   │   └── Calculate True Range as (High - Low)
│   ├── Calculate 20 Day Moving Average of True Range
│   └── Normalize VWAP Deviation by 20 Day Moving Average of True Range
│       └── Divide VWAP Deviation by 20 Day Moving Average of True Range
├── Incorporate More Price Levels
│   ├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Spread
│   │   ├── Subtract Open Price from Close Price
│   ├── Calculate 20 Day Moving Average of Open-Close Spread
│   └── Normalize Open-Close Spread by 20 Day Moving Average of Open-Close Spread
│       └── Divide Open-Close Spread by 20 Day Moving Average of Open-Close Spread
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Weighted Sum of Normalized VWAP Deviation and Normalized Open-Close Spread
│   └── Assign Weights Based on Historical Performance
├── Apply Dynamic Thresholds
│   ├── Calculate 20 Day Moving Standard Deviation of Combined Factor
│   ├── Set Upper and Lower Thresholds
│   │   ├── Upper Threshold: Mean + 1.5 * Standard Deviation
│   │   └── Lower Threshold: Mean - 1.5 * Standard Deviation
│   ├── Filter Combined Factor
│   │   ├── Only consider values above the Upper Threshold or below the Lower Threshold
│   └── Interpretation: Aims to identify robust signals where deviations are significant
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Values that pass the dynamic threshold filtering
    └── Interpretation: Combines normalized VWAP deviation, open-close spread, and volatility to generate a robust alpha factor
