Integrate volatility, incorporate market sentiment, and refine with machine learning for dynamic weighting.
Integrate more momentum and volume volatility, leverage multi-period returns, and use dynamic weighting.
Incorporate dynamic weighting, consider intraday price levels, and integrate with momentum for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate adaptive EMA, refine multi-period momentum, and dynamically adjust thresholds for volatility.
Focus on VWAP, integrate with momentum, and consider cumulative deviations for stronger signals.
Incorporate VWAP, cumulative deviations, and adjust for volume-impacted intraday momentum for enhanced predictive power.
Integrate more dynamic elements like EMA, true range, and cumulative deviations for improved factor robustness.
