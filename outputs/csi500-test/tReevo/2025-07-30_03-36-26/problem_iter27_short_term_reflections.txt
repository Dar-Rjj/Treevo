Integrate more sophisticated momentum measures and consider cross-sectional volatility for enhanced factor performance.
Simplify momentum calculations, use fixed periods, and integrate intraday volatility for a more robust and interpretable factor.
Simplify momentum periods, focus on VWAP deviation, and enhance with dynamic volatility adjustments.
Focus on adaptive momentum, simplify volatility measures, and prioritize intraday price action for enhanced alpha.
Incorporate adaptive momentum, volatility, and intraday measures; adjust periods dynamically based on market conditions.
Simplify momentum calculations, use fixed periods, and emphasize recent data for more responsive factors.
Adapt momentum periods based on volatility, integrate with VWAP deviations and intraday ranges for a more responsive alpha factor.
Simplify momentum integration, enhance volatility with high-frequency data, and normalize factors for better comparability.
Simplify momentum calculations, focus on key periods, and normalize factors for better comparability.
Simplify momentum integration, balance VWAP and price deviations, and use unweighted sum for volatility.
