Focus on volume-weighted metrics and cumulative deviations for more robust, interpretable factors.
Incorporate long-term trends, volume-price correlation, and threshold filtering for robust signal identification.
Integrate more price levels, enhance volume weighting, and consider market trends for improved factor robustness.
Incorporate volatility, leverage moving averages, and consider volume trends for refined signal strength.
Incorporate volume for weighting, use cumulative deviations, and integrate price and volume dynamics for stronger signals.
Incorporate liquidity, use more price levels, and consider cumulative effects for enhanced factor robustness.
Incorporate VWAP, use price changes, and normalize by volume for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate volume-weighted metrics and relative price changes for more robust factor signals.
Focus on return-based factors, volume-adjusted returns, and cumulative effects for improved predictive performance.
Incorporate price momentum, volume trends, and volatility measures for enhanced predictive signals.
