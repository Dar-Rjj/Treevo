Volume Adjusted Momentum and Volatility Composite
├── Calculate Daily Log Return
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract previous day's Close from today's Close
├── Compute Simple Moving Average of Log Returns (SMA_L)
│   └── Averaging over a fixed window, e.g., 20 days
├── Estimate Volatility by Standard Deviation of Log Returns (SD_L)
│   └── Calculating the standard deviation over the same window as SMA
├── Adjust Momentum by Volume
│   ├── Compute Daily Volume Momentum
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Take the difference in volume between consecutive days
│   └── Multiply SMA_L by the Daily Volume Momentum
└── Combine Momentum and Volatility Components
    ├── Add adjusted momentum to the negative of volatility
    └── This creates a factor that aims to capture strong trends with high volume and stable price movements
