Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Dynamic Lookback and Volatility
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t-1
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Dynamic Lookback Period
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
├── Stabilize with Volatility
│   ├── Adjust for Short-Term Volatility
│   │   ├── Use 5-day Standard Deviation
│   │   └── Normalize Short-Term SMA with 5-day Standard Deviation
│   └── Adjust for Long-Term Volatility
│       ├── Use 20-day Standard Deviation
│       └── Normalize Long-Term SMA with 20-day Standard Deviation
└── Combine Signals
    ├── Calculate the difference between Short-Term and Long-Term Volatility-Adjusted SMAs
    └── Use as a final alpha factor to predict future stock returns
