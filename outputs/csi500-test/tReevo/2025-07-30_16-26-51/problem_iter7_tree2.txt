Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Multi-Period Analysis and Volatility Stabilization
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t-1
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Dynamic Lookback Periods
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   ├── Mid-Term Lookback (e.g., 10 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 10-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 10-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
└── Stabilize with Multi-Period Volatility
    ├── Combine Short-Term and Long-Term Volatilities
    │   ├── Use 5-day Standard Deviation for Short-Term Volatility
    │   └── Use 20-day Standard Deviation for Long-Term Volatility
    │       ├── Weight Short-Term Volatility (e.g., 0.6 * 5-day Std Dev)
    │       └── Weight Long-Term Volatility (e.g., 0.4 * 20-day Std Dev)
    └── Final Factor
        ├── Use Combined Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
        └── Divide by Combined Volatility
