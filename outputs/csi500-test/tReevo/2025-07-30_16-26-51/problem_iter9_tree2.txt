Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Multi-Period Analysis and Combined Volatility
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   ├── Use Open price of day t-1
│   └── Use Volume of day t
│       ├── Compute Close-to-Open Return: (Close(t) - Open(t-1)) / Open(t-1)
│       └── Weight by Volume: Volume-Weighted Return = Close-to-Open Return * Volume(t)
├── Dynamic Lookback Periods
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Returns
│   ├── Mid-Term Lookback (e.g., 10 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 10-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 10-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Returns
└── Stabilize with Combined Multi-Period Volatility
    ├── Combine Short-Term, Mid-Term, and Long-Term Volatilities
    │   ├── Use 5-day Standard Deviation for Short-Term Volatility
    │   ├── Use 10-day Standard Deviation for Mid-Term Volatility
    │   └── Use 20-day Standard Deviation for Long-Term Volatility
    │       ├── Assign weights to each volatility (e.g., 0.4, 0.3, 0.3)
    │       └── Compute Combined Volatility: Combined Volatility = (0.4 * Short-Term Volatility) + (0.3 * Mid-Term Volatility) + (0.3 * Long-Term Volatility)
    └── Final Factor
        ├── Use Combined Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
        └── Divide by Combined Volatility: Final Factor = Combined Volume-Weighted Return / Combined Volatility
