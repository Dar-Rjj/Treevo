Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Dynamic Lookback and Volatility
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Dynamic Lookback Period
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Close-to-Open Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Simple Moving Average of Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Close-to-Open Returns
├── Stabilize with Volatility
│   ├── Adjust for Short-Term Volatility
│   │   ├── Use 5-day Standard Deviation
│   │   └── Normalize Close-to-Open Return by 5-day Standard Deviation
│   └── Adjust for Long-Term Volatility
│       ├── Use 20-day Standard Deviation
│       └── Normalize Close-to-Open Return by 20-day Standard Deviation
└── Combine Adjusted Factors
    ├── Combine Short-Term and Long-Term Adjusted Factors
    │   ├── Weighted Sum: w1 * Short-Term Adjusted Factor + w2 * Long-Term Adjusted Factor
    │   └── Weights: w1, w2 (determined by backtesting or optimization)
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── Use the combined factor as the final alpha factor
