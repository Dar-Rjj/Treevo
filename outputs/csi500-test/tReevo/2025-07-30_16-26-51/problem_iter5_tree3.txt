Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Dynamic Lookback and Volatility
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t-1
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Dynamic Lookback Period
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
└── Stabilize with Volatility
    ├── Use 5-day Standard Deviation for Short-Term Volatility
    └── Use 20-day Standard Deviation for Long-Term Volatility
    ├── Combine Short-Term and Long-Term Volatility
    │   ├── If Short-Term Volatility > Long-Term Volatility, use Short-Term Lookback
    │   └── Otherwise, use Long-Term Lookback
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── Adjust Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return by Selected Volatility
        └── Output as the Alpha Factor
