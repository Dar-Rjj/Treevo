Adaptive Volatility and Multi-Period Analysis for Enhanced Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t-1
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Dynamic Lookback Periods
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   ├── Mid-Term Lookback (e.g., 10 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 10-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns

│   │   └── Use 20-day Standard Deviation for Long-Term Volatility
│   └── Dynamic Weighting Based on Market Conditions
│       ├── Evaluate Market Volatility Regime
│       ├── Assign Weights to Short-Term, Mid-Term, and Long-Term Volatilities
│       └── Calculate Combined Volatility
├── Additional Price-Based Factors
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Price Ratio
│   │   ├── Use High price of day t
│   │   └── Use Low price of day t
│   └── Calculate 5-Day High-Low Momentum
│       ├── Sum the last 5 days' High-Low Price Ratios
│       └── Use High-Low Price Ratio of day t
├── Incorporate Smoothed Volume
│   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with a span of 20 days
│   └── Use Volume of day t
├── Combine Multi-Period Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Add Short-Term, Mid-Term, and Long-Term Simple Moving Averages
│   └── Use Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
├── Adjust for Volatility
│   ├── Divide the Combined Factor by Combined Volatility
│   └── Use Combined Factor
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Adjusted Factor with High-Low Momentum and Smoothed Volume
    └── Use the Adjusted and Weighted Factor
