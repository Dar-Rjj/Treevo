Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Multi-Period Analysis and Combined Volatility
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t-1
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Dynamic Lookback Periods
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   ├── Mid-Term Lookback (e.g., 10 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 10-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 10-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
├── Adaptive Volatility
│   ├── Combine Short-Term, Mid-Term, and Long-Term Volatilities
│   │   ├── Use 5-day Standard Deviation for Short-Term Volatility
│   │   ├── Use 10-day Standard Deviation for Mid-Term Volatility
│   │   └── Use 20-day Standard Deviation for Long-Term Volatility
│   └── Weighted Average of Volatilities
│       ├── Assign Weights to Short-Term, Mid-Term, and Long-Term Volatilities
│       └── Calculate Weighted Average
└── Final Factor
    ├── Use Combined Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
    └── Divide by Adaptive Volatility
