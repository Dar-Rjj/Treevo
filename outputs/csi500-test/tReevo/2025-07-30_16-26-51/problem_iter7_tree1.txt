Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Adaptive Volatility and Multi-Period Analysis
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   ├── Use Open price of day t-1
│   └── Multiply by Volume of day t
├── Dynamic Lookback Periods
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   ├── Mid-Term Lookback (e.g., 10 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 10-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 10-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
├── Adaptive Volatility Stabilization
│   ├── Combine Short-Term and Long-Term Volatilities
│   │   ├── Use 5-day Standard Deviation for Short-Term Volatility
│   │   └── Use 20-day Standard Deviation for Long-Term Volatility
│   └── Weighted Volatility Combination
│       ├── Assign Weights to Short-Term and Long-Term Volatilities
│       └── Sum of Weighted Volatilities
└── Final Factor Calculation
    ├── Use Combined Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
    └── Divide by Adaptive Volatility
