Incorporating Adaptive Lookback Periods, Weighted Multi-Period Volatilities, and Dynamic Market Trend Adjustments
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   ├── Use Open price of day t-1
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by (Close price - Open price) / Open price
├── Adaptive Lookback Periods
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Exponential Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   ├── Mid-Term Lookback (e.g., 10 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 10-day Exponential Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 10-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Exponential Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
├── Combine Multi-Period Volatilities
│   ├── Assign Weights to Each Volatility
│   │   ├── Short-Term Volatility Weight (adjust based on market conditions)
│   │   ├── Mid-Term Volatility Weight (adjust based on market conditions)
│   │   └── Long-Term Volatility Weight (adjust based on market conditions)
│   └── Sum of Weighted Volatilities
├── Incorporate Dynamic Market Trend Adjustments
│   ├── Calculate 5-Day and 20-Day Exponential Moving Averages of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Use Close prices over the last 5 days
│   │   └── Use Close prices over the last 20 days
│   ├── Calculate Price Trend Indicator
│   │   ├── If 5-Day EMA > 20-Day EMA, set Trend = 1
│   │   └── Otherwise, set Trend = -1
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Use Combined Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
    ├── Divide by Sum of Weighted Volatilities
    └── Multiply by Price Trend Indicator
