Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Dynamic Lookback and Volatility
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t-1
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Dynamic Lookback Period
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
└── Stabilize with Volatility
    ├── Use 5-day Standard Deviation for Short-Term Volatility Adjustment
    │   ├── Adjust 5-day SMA of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns by 5-day Standard Deviation
    └── Use 20-day Standard Deviation for Long-Term Volatility Adjustment
        ├── Adjust 20-day SMA of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns by 20-day Standard Deviation
