Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Dynamic Lookback and Volatility
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t-1
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Dynamic Lookback Period
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
└── Stabilize with Volatility
    ├── Short-Term Stabilization
    │   ├── Use 5-day Standard Deviation for Short-Term Volatility
    │   └── Adjust 5-day SMA by Short-Term Volatility
    └── Long-Term Stabilization
        ├── Use 20-day Standard Deviation for Long-Term Volatility
        └── Adjust 20-day SMA by Long-Term Volatility
