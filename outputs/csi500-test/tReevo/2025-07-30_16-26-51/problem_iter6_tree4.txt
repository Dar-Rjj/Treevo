Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return with Dynamic Lookback and Volatility
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t-1
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Dynamic Lookback Periods
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   └── Long-Term Lookback (e.g., 20 days)
│       ├── Calculate 20-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Calculate 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
├── Stabilize with Volatility
│   ├── Short-Term Stabilization
│   │   ├── Use 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Divide 5-day Simple Moving Average by 5-day Standard Deviation
│   └── Long-Term Stabilization
│       ├── Use 20-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│       └── Divide 20-day Simple Moving Average by 20-day Standard Deviation
└── Final Factor
    ├── Combine Short-Term and Long-Term Stabilized Factors
    └── Subtract Long-Term Stabilized Factor from Short-Term Stabilized Factor
