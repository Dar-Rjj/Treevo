├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   ├── Use Open price of day t-1
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Compute: (Close_t - Open_{t-1}) * Volume_t
├── Adaptive Lookback Periods
│   ├── Short-Term Lookback (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   ├── Calculate 5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Standard Deviation of Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
│   ├── Mid-Term Lookback (e.g., 10 days)

├── Incorporate Dynamic Market Trend Adjustments
│   ├── Calculate 5-Day and 20-Day Moving Averages of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Use Close prices over the last 5 days
│   │   └── Use Close prices over the last 20 days
│   ├── Calculate Price Trend Indicator
│   │   ├── Compare 5-Day Moving Average to 20-Day Moving Average
│   │   │   ├── If 5-Day > 20-Day, Trend is Up
│   │   │   └── If 5-Day <= 20-Day, Trend is Down
│   └── Adjust Combined Factor by Price Trend Indicator
│       ├── If Trend is Up, Apply Positive Adjustment: 1.2 * Combined Factor
│       └── If Trend is Down, Apply Negative Adjustment: 0.8 * Combined Factor
├── Integrate High-Low Price Ratio
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   ├── Use Low price of day t
│   └── Calculate High-Low Price Ratio: (High_t - Low_t) / (High_t + Low_t)
├── Incorporate Additional Market Indicators
│   ├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   │   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   │   └── Use Close price of day t-1
│   │   └── Compute: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
│   ├── Calculate 5-Day Average Daily Price Change
│   │   ├── Use Daily Price Changes over the last 5 days
│   └── Adjust Combined Factor by 5-Day Average Daily Price Change
│       ├── If 5-Day Average Daily Price Change > 0, Apply Positive Adjustment: 1.1 * Combined Factor
│       └── If 5-Day Average Daily Price Change <= 0, Apply Negative Adjustment: 0.9 * Combined Factor
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Returns
    │   ├── Use 5-day SMA of Volume-Weighted Returns
    │   ├── Use 10-day EMA of Volume-Weighted Returns
    │   └── Use 20-day EMA of Volume-Weighted Returns
    ├── Incorporate Market Trend Adjustment
    │   ├── If Trend is Up, use Bullish Factor
    │   └── If Trend is Down, use Bearish Factor
    ├── Divide by Combined Volatility
    ├── Multiply by High-Low Price Ratio
    └── Adjust by 5-Day Average Daily Price Change
