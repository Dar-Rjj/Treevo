High-to-Low Range Momentum Adjusted by Volume
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Compute Rolling Standard Deviation of Range
│   ├── Use High-to-Low Range
│   └── Apply rolling window (e.g., 20 days) to calculate standard deviation
├── Calculate Short-Term Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Compute short-term (e.g., 5 days) return
├── Combine Short-Term Momentum with Range Volatility
│   ├── Multiply Short-Term Momentum by Rolling Standard Deviation of Range
├── Adjust Combined Momentum by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Divide Combined Momentum by Volume
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Result of adjusting combined momentum by volume
