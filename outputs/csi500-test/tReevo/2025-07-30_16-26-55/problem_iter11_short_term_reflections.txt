Integrate longer-term trends, consider volume changes, and explore inter-day price patterns for improved factor robustness.
Simplify calculations, use specific rolling windows, and directly adjust momentum by volume for clearer, more effective factors.
Focus on dynamic range, precise normalization, and integrate volume earlier in the process.
Focus on combining short-term trends with momentum, and adjust by volume for enhanced factor performance.
Focus on volatility and volume adjustments, simplify momentum calculations, and emphasize recent price action.
Incorporate normalization and subtract volatility for more refined momentum signals.
Integrate volatility, focus on short-term trends, and adjust by volume for enhanced predictive power.
Simplify calculations, focus on direct relationships, and ensure volume adjustment enhances, not distorts, the combined factor.
Incorporate rolling mean and standard deviation for normalization, adjust with volume for enhanced signal.
Normalize momentum, consider volume trends, and integrate longer-term price movements.
