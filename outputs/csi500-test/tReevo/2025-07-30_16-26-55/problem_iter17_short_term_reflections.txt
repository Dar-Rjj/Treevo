Leverage volume as a multiplier, not a divisor, and normalize momentum for better scaling.
Consider smoothing and normalization techniques, integrate more market features, and refine weighting by volume.
Incorporate volatility, adjust with volume multiplicatively, and consider trend deviations for enhanced factor performance.
Incorporate volatility normalization and trend adjustments, subtracting standard deviation for sharper signals.
Normalize range before momentum, integrate with trend, adjust by volume for more robust factors.
Incorporate volume multiplication, focus on momentum, and utilize short-term trends for improved factor performance.
Normalize with rolling mean, adjust by volume after combining momentum and trend.
Incorporate volatility normalization and use shorter moving averages for more responsive trends.
Normalize ranges, use rolling stats for adjustment, combine with trend, and adjust by volume.
Multiply combined factors by volume for amplification, not division. Consider trend strength and range volatility.
