Normalize momentum, integrate trend adjustments, and consider volume impact for enhanced factor robustness.
Normalize range momentum, integrate trend effectively, and adjust by volume for enhanced predictive power.
Normalize by rolling mean, adjust with volume, and consider subtracting volatility for stabilization.
Integrate volume later, focus on price momentum initially, then adjust by volume for final factor.
Normalize range with its rolling standard deviation for more stable momentum signals.
Normalize range, integrate trend and momentum, and adjust by volume for more robust factors.
Incorporate volume normalization, and consider the long-term trend for a more robust factor.
Integrate volume early, normalize with rolling stats, and combine with short-term trend for enhanced predictive power.
Normalize by rolling mean, consider volatility adjustments, and integrate volume more effectively.
Simplify adjustments, focus on core momentum, and consider volume as a direct multiplier for final factor.
