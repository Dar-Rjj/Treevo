Leverage exponential smoothing for trends and consider volume-weighted range for enhanced momentum signals.
Incorporate EMA for smoother trends, adjust by both volume and inverse volatility for more robust normalization.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use logarithmic returns, and consider volume shocks.
Focus on refining trend and momentum, simplify adjustments, and consider volume impact more directly.
Simplify adjustments, focus on core momentum, and consider volume and trend integration more directly.
Incorporate normalized momentum, utilize volume-adjusted trends, and consider longer-term price patterns.
Incorporate short-term trends, normalize by rolling mean, and adjust factors by volume for improved predictive performance.
Incorporate volume and use moving averages for trend, prefer standard deviation for momentum, and simplify adjustments.
Incorporate long-term trends and adjust momentum by both mean and standard deviation for improved factor robustness.
Normalize volatility, use moving averages for trends, and adjust by volume for improved factor stability and predictive power.
