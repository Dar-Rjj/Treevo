Incorporate longer-term trends, normalize by average volume, and consider range volatility.
Normalize by rolling mean, consider longer trends, and adjust for volume more dynamically.
Integrate volatility and volume adjustments, simplify trend integration, and use normalized momentum for enhanced factor performance.
Normalize by rolling mean, adjust with short-term trend, and consider volume impact.
Integrate volume earlier, use normalized momentum, and consider long-term trends for stability.
Incorporate volume as a multiplier, not a divisor, and consider longer-term trends for stability.
Integrate more market features, use exponential smoothing, and apply weighted combinations for enhanced factor robustness.
Normalize range, adjust by volume, and consider short-term trends for more robust alpha factors.
Normalize ranges, use rolling stats for dynamic adjustment, and balance trend and momentum carefully.
Incorporate volume normalization and use rolling statistics for more robust momentum measures.
