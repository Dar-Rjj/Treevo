Consider volatility and trend normalization, and explore volume-weighted adjustments for refined momentum signals.
Incorporate long-term trend, use rolling statistics, and combine with short-term trend for enhanced factor robustness.
Normalize by rolling mean and use moving average for trend; consider volatility subtraction.
Integrate more market data, use EMA for smoothing, and adjust factors by inverse volatility and volume.
Normalize by rolling mean and use moving average for short-term trend to enhance signal clarity.
Integrate volatility, trend strength, and liquidity; simplify calculations for clearer signals.
Integrate volume early, use relative momentum, and focus on long-term trend stability.
Incorporate normalization, use rolling statistics, and consider subtracting volatility for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Incorporate volume-adjusted momentum, utilize EMAs, and normalize by inverse volatility for robust, predictive alpha factors.
Incorporate inverse volatility, use EMAs for smoothing, and adjust factors by volume for enhanced predictive power.
