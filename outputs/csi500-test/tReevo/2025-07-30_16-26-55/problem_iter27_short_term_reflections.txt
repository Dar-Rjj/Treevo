Incorporate EMA for smoother trends, use inverse volatility for stability, and leverage volume for final weighting.
Focus on dynamic range, short-term trend, and volume; simplify calculations; avoid over-normalization.
Incorporate liquidity and market depth, refine momentum with longer-term EMAs, and consider price level changes.
Consider incorporating normalized volume and longer-term trend for more robust factor stability.
Consider shorter EMA windows and incorporate trading volume earlier in the factor calculation.
Incorporate EMA for smoother trends, use inverse volatility for risk adjustment, and volume to scale impact.
Incorporate trade volume trends and adjust momentum with a longer-term volatility measure for stability.
Simplify adjustments, focus on momentum and volatility, and consider volume impact more directly.
Integrate trade amount, refine momentum with weighted EMA, and explore cross-asset signals for enhanced alpha.
Incorporate EMA for smoothing, use inverse volatility for risk adjustment, and leverage volume for liquidity signal.
