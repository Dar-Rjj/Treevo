High-to-Low with Volume, Adaptive Momentum, and Volatility
├── Calculate High-to-Low Ratio
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       ├── Subtract Low from High
│       └── Divide by Low
├── Adjust for Volume Weight
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply High-to-Low Ratio by Volume
├── Incorporate Adaptive Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close prices
│   │   ├── Calculate Short-term Exponential Moving Average (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   └── Calculate Long-term Exponential Moving Average (e.g., 20 days)
│   └── Determine Adaptive Momentum
│       ├── Subtract Short-term EMA from Long-term EMA
│       └── Categorize as Bullish, Neutral, or Bearish
├── Integrate Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Historical Volatility (e.g., 20-day standard deviation of returns)
│   └── Adjust Momentum based on Volatility
│       ├── If Volatility is high, amplify momentum signal
│       └── If Volatility is low, dampen momentum signal
└── Combine Factors
    ├── High-to-Low with Volume Adjustment
    └── Integrate Adaptive Momentum and Volatility
        ├── If Momentum is Bullish and Volatility is high, Increase Factor
        ├── If Momentum is Bullish and Volatility is low, Keep Original Factor
        ├── If Momentum is Neutral, Keep Original Factor
        ├── If Momentum is Bearish and Volatility is high, Decrease Factor
        └── If Momentum is Bearish and Volatility is low, Keep Original Factor
