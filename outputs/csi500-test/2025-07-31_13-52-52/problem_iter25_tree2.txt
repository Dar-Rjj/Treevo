Thought: Utilize price and volume data to create alpha factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate daily return
  - Sub-thought: Use closing price (close[t] / close[t-1] - 1)
- Sub-thought: Momentum signals
  - Sub-thought: Compute short-term momentum (average of last 5 days' returns)
  - Sub-thought: Compute long-term momentum (average of last 20 days' returns)
  - Sub-thought: Subtract long-term momentum from short-term momentum for a momentum crossover signal
- Sub-thought: Volume-based indicators
  - Sub-thought: Daily volume change (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
  - Sub-thought: Moving average of volume over the last 10 days
  - Sub-thought: Volume increase ratio (volume[t] / moving average of volume over the last 10 days)
- Sub-thought: Price volatility
  - Sub-thought: Daily high-low range (high[t] - low[t])
  - Sub-thought: Average true range over the past 14 days
  - Sub-thought: Volatility ratio (daily high-low range / average true range)
- Sub-thought: Money flow
  - Sub-thought: Calculate typical price (typical_price = (high + low + close) / 3)
  - Sub-thought: Raw money flow (raw_money_flow = typical_price * volume)
  - Sub-thought: Positive and negative money flow
    - Sub-thought: If typical_price > typical_price[t-1], positive money flow += raw_money_flow; else, negative money_flow += raw_money_flow
  - Sub-thought: Money flow ratio (positive money flow / negative money flow over the last 14 days)
- Sub-thought: Price patterns
  - Sub-thought: Engulfing pattern (if open[t] < close[t-1] and close[t] > open[t-1])
  - Sub-thought: Doji pattern (if absolute(close[t] - open[t]) <= 0.1 * (high[t] - low[t]))
  - Sub-thought: Hammer or inverted hammer (if low[t] < close[t-1] and close[t] > open[t] and close[t] - open[t] > 2 * (open[t] - low[t]))
- Sub-thought: Trend indicators
  - Sub-thought: Simple moving average of closing prices over the last 50 days
  - Sub-thought: Exponential moving average of closing prices over the last 20 days
  - Sub-thought: EMA_20 crossing above/below SMA_50 (EMA_20[t] > SMA_50[t])
