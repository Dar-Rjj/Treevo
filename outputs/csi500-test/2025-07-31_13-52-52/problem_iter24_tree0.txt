Thought: Develop advanced alpha factors based on price and volume data
  |-Subthought: Utilize raw OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices for generating alpha signals
    |-Subthought: Calculate the weighted average of close prices over the last N days, giving more weight to recent prices
    |-Subthought: Use the high-low spread to indicate market volatility and potential trading opportunities
      |-Subthought: Introduce a factor that measures the ratio of the high-low spread to the average true range over the past M days
  |-Subthought: Incorporate volume data alongside price data to capture strength of movement
    |-Subthought: Formulate a factor by dividing today's volume by the median volume over the past N days, highlighting unusual activity
    |-Subthought: Create a factor that measures the cumulative sum of the product of volume changes and price changes over a specified time window, suggesting accumulation or distribution phases
  |-Subthought: Explore combinations of price and volume features to identify hidden patterns
    |-Subthought: Design a factor based on the relationship between the percentage change in closing price and the percentage change in volume, indicating the impact of volume on price movements
    |-Subthought: Investigate the interaction between the open-close spread and the volume traded at the opening session to gauge early session sentiment
      |-Subthought: Introduce a factor that normalizes the open-close spread by the average daily range and multiplies it by the opening volume, capturing the intensity of early session trading
