Thought: Develop advanced alpha factors by combining momentum, volatility, and volume indicators
    Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over different windows
        Sub-thought: Compute 5-day SMA
        Sub-thought: Compute 10-day SMA
        Sub-thought: Compute 20-day SMA
    Sub-thought: Measure the rate of change (ROC) for various time periods to capture momentum
        Sub-thought: Calculate 1-day ROC
        Sub-thought: Calculate 5-day ROC
        Sub-thought: Calculate 10-day ROC
    Sub-thought: Create a momentum factor by combining different SMAs and ROCs
        Sub-thought: Combine 5-day and 10-day SMAs
        Sub-thought: Combine 1-day and 5-day ROCs
    Sub-thought: Analyze the volatility of the stock using high, low, and close prices
        Sub-thought: Calculate the true range (TR) for each day
            Sub-thought: TR = max(high - low, abs(high - previous close), abs(low - previous close))
        Sub-thought: Compute the average true range (ATR) over a certain period
            Sub-thought: Calculate 14-day ATR
        Sub-thought: Use ATR to create a volatility factor
            Sub-thought: Volatility Factor = ATR / 14-day ATR
        Sub-thought: Incorporate the relative strength index (RSI) to measure recent price changes
            Sub-thought: Compute 14-day RSI
            Sub-thought: Use RSI to identify overbought and oversold conditions
                Sub-thought: Overbought if RSI > 70
                Sub-thought: Oversold if RSI < 30
    Sub-thought: Utilize volume to gauge market sentiment
        Sub-thought: Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) to track buying and selling pressure
            Sub-thought: If today's close > yesterday's close, OBV = OBV + today's volume
            Sub-thought: If today's close < yesterday's close, OBV = OBV - today's volume
            Sub-thought: If today's close = yesterday's close, OBV = OBV
        Sub-thought: Create a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) to assess the average price paid per share
            Sub-thought: VWAP = (sum(close * volume) / sum(volume)) over a specific period
        Sub-thought: Develop a volume-based factor
            Sub-thought: Volume Factor = VWAP / Simple Moving Average of VWAP
                Sub-thought: Compute 20-day SMA of VWAP
                Sub-thought: Volume Factor = VWAP / 20-day SMA of VWAP
    Sub-thought: Integrate momentum, volatility, and volume factors into a comprehensive alpha factor
        Sub-thought: Combine momentum, volatility, and volume factors
            Sub-thought: Alpha Factor = Momentum Factor * Volatility Factor * Volume Factor
