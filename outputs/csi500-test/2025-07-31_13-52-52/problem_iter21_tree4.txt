Thought: Develop alpha factors based on price and volume data
  |-Subthought: Utilize raw OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices for generating alpha signals
    |-Subthought: Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close as a simple momentum factor
    |-Subthought: Use the high-low spread to indicate market volatility and potential trading opportunities
  |-Subthought: Incorporate volume data alongside price data to capture strength of movement
    |-Subthought: Formulate a factor by dividing today's volume by the average volume over the past N days, highlighting unusual activity
    |-Subthought: Create a factor that measures the correlation between volume changes and price changes over a specified time window, suggesting accumulation or distribution phases
  |-Subthought: Explore combinations of price and volume features to identify hidden patterns
    |-Subthought: Design a factor based on the relationship between the change in closing price and the change in volume, indicating the impact of volume on price movements
    |-Subthought: Investigate the interaction between the open-close spread and the volume traded at the opening session to gauge early session sentiment
