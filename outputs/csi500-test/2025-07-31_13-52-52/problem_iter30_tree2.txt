Alpha Mining and Factor Generation
- Price Based Factors
  - Momentum Indicators
    - Weighted Moving Average (WMA): (close*2 + high + low) / 4 over a window of n days
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI): 100 - (100 / (1 + (average gain / average loss)))
  - Volatility Indicators
    - True Range (TR): max(high-low, abs(high-close_(t-1)), abs(low-close_(t-1)))
    - Bollinger Bands: SMA(close, n) ± 2 * Standard Deviation of close over n days
- Volume Based Factors
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV): If close > close_(t-1), OBV = OBV_(t-1) + volume; else if close < close_(t-1), OBV = OBV_(t-1) - volume; else, OBV = OBV_(t-1)
  - Money Flow Index (MFI): 100 - (100 / (1 + (positive money flow / negative money flow)))
- Price-Volume Combined Factors
  - Price Volume Trend (PVT): (close - close_(t-1)) / close_(t-1) * volume + PVT_(t-1)
  - Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D): (close - low) - (high - close) / (high - low) * volume
- Gap and Opening Factors
  - Open-Close Ratio: open / close_(t-1)
  - High-Low Gap: high - max(close, open)
  - Low-High Reversal: min(open, close) - low
- Market Sentiment Factors
  - Bearish/Bullish Candles: If close < open, Bearish signal; else, Bullish signal
  - Hammer Pattern: If the body is small (less than 30% of the range) and the lower shadow is at least twice the length of the body, mark as Hammer
- Transaction Value Considerations
  - Average Value Per Transaction: (high + low) / 2 * volume
  - Value Growth: (average value per transaction at t / average value per transaction at t-n) - 1
- Technical Pattern Recognition
  - Head and Shoulders: Identify patterns with a peak (left shoulder), followed by a higher peak (head), and then a lower peak similar to the left shoulder
  - Triangle Patterns: Identification of ascending, descending, or symmetrical triangle formations
- Statistical Measures on Historical Data
  - Historical Return Skewness: Measure of the asymmetry of returns over a defined period
  - Historical Return Kurtosis: Measure of the "tailedness" of the return distribution
- Order Imbalance Indicators
  - Buy/Sell Imbalance: Difference between buy-initiated and sell-initiated trades' volume
  - Limit Order Book Slope: Estimated from the first-level bid-ask spread and their respective volumes
- Seasonal Factors
  - Month of the Year Effect: Average returns for each month over history
  - Day of the Week Effect: Average returns for each day of the week
- Inter-Market Factors
  - Correlation with Major Indices: Pearson correlation coefficient with S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.
  - Relative Strength: Performance relative to a benchmark index
