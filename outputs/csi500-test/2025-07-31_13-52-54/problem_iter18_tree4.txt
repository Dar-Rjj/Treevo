Thought: Synthesized Alpha Factor Combining Trend, Momentum, and Volume Intensity
- Sub-Thought: Develop trend following alpha factor using close prices
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of closing prices
    - Sub-Thought: Identify the period for EMA calculation, e.g., 50 days
  - Sub-Thought: Determine the current stock's position relative to its EMA
    - Sub-Thought: Generate a signal; 1 if the current close is above the EMA, -1 if below, 0 if equal
- Sub-Thought: Explore momentum in high and low prices
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today’s high and the previous day’s high
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today’s low and the previous day’s low
  - Sub-Thought: Sum the differences to get a combined momentum score
  - Sub-Thought: Create a simple threshold to classify stocks as having positive or negative momentum based on the score
- Sub-Thought: Analyze volume patterns
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the percentage change in volume from the previous day
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily volume percentage change
  - Sub-Thought: Use the volume change to infer trading activity and sentiment
    - Sub-Thought: Assign a value indicating strong buying (positive change) or selling (negative change) pressure
- Sub-Thought: Leverage price and volume for an intensity factor
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply the return (close to close) by the square root of the volume traded
  - Sub-Thought: Interpret the result as a measure of market participant intensity
    - Sub-Thought: A high positive value suggests strong buying interest, while a high negative value indicates strong selling pressure
- Sub-Thought: Long-Term Volume-Weighted Average Return (Momentum Component)
  - Sub-Thought: Sum of (Daily Returns * Square Root of Volume) for the last 100 days
  - Sub-Thought: Divide by the sum of the square roots of the volumes over the 100 days
- Sub-Thought: Short-Term Volume-Weighted Average Return (Reversal Component)
  - Sub-Thought: Sum of (Daily Returns * Square Root of Volume) for the last 5 days
  - Sub-Thought: Divide by the sum of the square roots of the volumes over the 5 days
- Sub-Thought: Intraday Return
  - Sub-Thought: High - Low
  - Sub-Thought: (High - Low) / Close
- Sub-Thought: Intraday Volatility
  - Sub-Thought: |High - Low|
  - Sub-Thought: Sum(|High - Low|) over 20 days
- Sub-Thought: Intraday Momentum
  - Sub-Thought: Intraday Return * Square Root of Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Sum(Intraday Return * Square Root of Volume) over 5 days
- Sub-Thought: Volume-Weighted Intraday Reversal
  - Sub-Thought: -(Intraday Return * Square Root of Volume)
  - Sub-Thought: Sum(-(Intraday Return * Square Root of Volume)) over 10 days
- Sub-Thought: Price Momentum
  - Sub-Thought: n-day return of Close
  - Sub-Thought: n-day return of Open
- Sub-Thought: Calculate Weighted High-Low Spread Adjusted for Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Subtract Low from High
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply by (Square Root of Volume / Average Square Root of Volume of Last 5 Days)
- Sub-Thought: Divide Price Momentum by Weighted High-Low Spread Adjusted for Volume
- Sub-Thought: Combined Alpha Factor
  - Sub-Thought: (Long-Term Volume-Weighted Average Return - Short-Term Volume-Weighted Average Return)
  - Sub-Thought: + (Intraday Momentum + Volume-Weighted Intraday Reversal)
  - Sub-Thought: Multiplied by Price Momentum
  - Sub-Thought: Add the divided price momentum
- Sub-Thought: Final Alpha Factor
  - Sub-Thought: Combined Alpha Factor
  - Sub-Thought: Combine the final alpha factor with the position relative to EMA, high-low momentum, and volume intensity
  - Sub-Thought: Create a weighted sum of these factors to form a final alpha factor
