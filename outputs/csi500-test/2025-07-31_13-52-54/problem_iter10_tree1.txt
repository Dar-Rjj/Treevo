Volume-Weighted and Averaged High-Low Spread with Momentum Factor
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High price
├── Compute Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Multiply (High - Low) by Volume for each day in the lookback period
│   └── Sum of all these values
├── Calculate Momentum Component
│   ├── Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Average of Past n Days' Volume-Weighted High-Low Spreads
│   └── Subtract past average from current value to get momentum
├── Generate Final Factor
│   ├── Combine the Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread and Momentum
│   │   └── Add the two components together
│   ├── Divide this combination by the Close price
└── Output: Volume-Weighted and Averaged High-Low Spread with Momentum Factor
