Thought: Synthesize Trend, Momentum, and Volume Factors
- Sub-Thought: Develop trend following alpha factor using close prices
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices
    - Sub-Thought: Identify the period for SMA calculation, e.g., 50 days
  - Sub-Thought: Determine the current stock's position relative to its SMA
    - Sub-Thought: Generate a binary signal; 1 if the current close is above the SMA, 0 otherwise
- Sub-Thought: Explore momentum in high and low prices
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today’s high and the previous day’s high
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today’s low and the previous day’s low
  - Sub-Thought: Sum the differences to get a combined momentum score
  - Sub-Thought: Create a simple threshold to classify stocks as having positive or negative momentum based on the score
- Sub-Thought: Analyze volume patterns
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the percentage change in volume from the previous day
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily volume percentage change
  - Sub-Thought: Use the volume change to infer trading activity and sentiment
    - Sub-Thought: Assign a value indicating strong buying (positive change) or selling (negative change) pressure
- Sub-Thought: Leverage price and volume for an intensity factor
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply the return (close to close) by the volume traded
  - Sub-Thought: Interpret the result as a measure of market participant intensity
    - Sub-Thought: A high positive value suggests strong buying interest, while a high negative value indicates strong selling pressure
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate intraday momentum with volume adjusted spread
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
    - Sub-Thought: Subtract Low from High
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate High-Close to Open-High Ratio
    - Sub-Thought: Subtract Close from High
    - Sub-Thought: Subtract Open from High
    - Sub-Thought: Divide (High - Close) by (High - Open)
  - Sub-Thought: Combine Adjusted Spread and Ratio
    - Sub-Thought: Adjust Intraday High-Low Spread by Volume
      - Sub-Thought: Multiply (High - Low) by Volume
      - Sub-Thought: Add Open to (Volume * (High - Low))
    - Sub-Thought: Add Volume Adjusted Spread to High-Close to Open-High Ratio
