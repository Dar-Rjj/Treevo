Thought: Synthesize Price and Intraday Momentum with Volume-Weighted Adjustments, Trend, and Intensity for Alpha Factor

├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   └── n-day return using Close price
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
│   └── Multiply (High - Low) by Volume
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Volatility
│   ├── Calculate range over n days using High and Low prices
│   └── Multiply Volatility by Volume
├── Calculate Trade Frequency Adjusted Return
│   ├── Count daily trades using Volume
│   └── n-day return adjusted by trade frequency
├── Combine Initial Factors
│   ├── Add Price Momentum and Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Multiply Sum by Volume-Adjusted Volatility
│   └── Add Trade Frequency Adjusted Return
├── Calculate 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices
├── Generate Binary Trend Signal
│   └── 1 if the current close is above the SMA, 0 otherwise
├── Calculate Combined Momentum Score
│   ├── Difference between today’s high and the previous day’s high
│   └── Difference between today’s low and the previous day’s low
├── Classify Momentum
│   └── Assign 1 for positive momentum, 0 for negative momentum based on combined score
├── Calculate Daily Volume Percentage Change
│   └── (Current Volume - Previous Volume) / Previous Volume
├── Compute High-Low Spread
│   └── Subtract Low from High price
├── Calculate Volume-Average Price
│   ├── Sum of (Close price * Volume)
│   └── Total Volume
├── Compute Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
│   └── Divide High-Low Spread by Volume-Average Price
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Return
│   └── Multiply the return (close to close) by the volume traded
├── Combine All Factors into a Composite Alpha Factor
│   ├── Weighted sum of trend, momentum, and intensity factors
│   └── Use Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio as a modifier to adjust the final alpha factor
└── Output: Composite Alpha Factor
