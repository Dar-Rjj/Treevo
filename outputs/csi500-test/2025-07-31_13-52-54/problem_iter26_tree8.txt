Calculate the difference between closing price and opening price as a simple indicator of daily stock movement
- Calculate the 5-day moving average of the daily price difference
  - Compute the 20-day standard deviation of the 5-day moving average of the daily price difference
    - Divide the 5-day moving average of the daily price difference by its 20-day standard deviation to measure the volatility-adjusted trend strength
- Calculate the 14-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the closing prices
  - Compute the difference between the current closing price and the 14-day EMA
    - Use the difference as an indication of the distance from the recent trend
- Count the number of days in the past month where the closing price was above the opening price
  - Calculate the ratio of up-days to total days as a measure of recent market sentiment
- Calculate the highest high and lowest low over the last 20 days
  - Compute the range percentage as (highest high - lowest low) / lowest low
- Calculate the sum of volume on days when the closing price is higher than the opening price, divided by the total volume over the same period
  - This ratio indicates the relative buying pressure
- For each day, calculate the return based on the close-to-close price change
  - Compute the cumulative return over the past 30 trading days
- Calculate the rate of change of the amount traded over the past 7 days
  - Identify whether there's a significant increase or decrease in transaction amount which could signal changes in investor interest
- Compute the average true range (ATR) over the past 14 days
  - Compare today's ATR with the 14-day ATR to gauge today's volatility relative to recent history
- Determine the direction and magnitude of the price gap (difference between today's open and yesterday's close)
  - Categorize the gaps into up, down, or no gap for pattern recognition
- Calculate the ratio of high price to low price for the day
  - Use this daily ratio to identify potential breakout or consolidation patterns
- Analyze the relationship between the day's high and the 20-day moving average of the closing price
  - Determine if the high is significantly above or below the moving average, indicating potential bullish or bearish signals
- Calculate Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
  - Subtract Low from High price
  - Multiply by Volume
    - Sum of (High - Low) * Volume
- Calculate Volume-Weighted Close Price
  - Sum of (Close price * Volume)
- Compute Ratio
  - Divide Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread by Volume-Weighted Close Price
