Thought: Analyze Momentum
- Sub-thought: Calculate Price Momentum
  - Calculation: (Close_t / Close_t-1) - 1
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Momentum
  - Calculation: (Volume_t / Volume_t-1) - 1

Thought: Analyze Volatility
- Sub-thought: Calculate Price Range
  - Calculation: (High_t - Low_t) / Close_t-1
- Sub-thought: Calculate Average True Range
  - Calculation: ATR_t = (ATR_t-1 * (n-1) + (High_t - Low_t)) / n
    - Note: Initialize ATR with the first n days' average true range
    - Note: n is a chosen number of periods, e.g., 14
- Sub-thought: Calculate Price Volatility
  - Calculation: Standard Deviation of daily returns over a period

Thought: Analyze Market Sentiment
- Sub-thought: Calculate Money Flow
  - Calculation: (Typical Price_t * Volume_t) - (Typical Price_t-1 * Volume_t-1)
  - Note: Typical Price = (High_t + Low_t + Close_t) / 3
- Sub-thought: Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
  - Calculation: OBV_t = OBV_t-1 + (Volume_t if Close_t > Close_t-1 else -Volume_t if Close_t < Close_t-1 else 0)

Thought: Analyze Support and Resistance
- Sub-thought: Identify Recent Highs and Lows
  - Calculation: Moving Maximum and Minimum of High and Low prices over a period
- Sub-thought: Calculate Price Breakout
  - Calculation: (Close_t - Moving Minimum) / Moving Maximum - Moving Minimum
- Sub-thought: Calculate Price Reversal
  - Calculation: (Close_t - Moving Maximum) / Moving Maximum - Moving Minimum
