Volume-Weighted and Averaged High-Low Spread with Momentum and Price Trend
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High price
├── Compute Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Multiply (High - Low) by Volume
│   └── Sum of these values over the lookback period
├── Calculate Momentum Component
│   ├── Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Average of Past n Days' Volume-Weighted High-Low Spreads
│   └── Subtract past average from current value
├── Generate Final Factor
│   ├── Combine Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread and Momentum
│   │   └── Add the two components together
│   ├── Divide this combination by the Close price
├── Incorporate Price Trend
│   ├── Calculate n-Day Moving Average of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Sum of Close prices over the last n days
│   │   └── Divide by n to get the moving average
│   ├── Subtract n-Day Moving Average from the Current Close Price
│   └── Multiply the result by the generated factor
└── Output: Combined Factor
