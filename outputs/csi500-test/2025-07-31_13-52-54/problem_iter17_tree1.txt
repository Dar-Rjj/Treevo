Crossover of Volume-Weighted and Averaged High-Low Spread with Momentum and Price Trend, and Price Momentum with Enhanced Volume-Weighted Volatility and Trade Frequency Adjustments
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High price
├── Compute Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Multiply (High - Low) by Volume
│   └── Sum of these values over the lookback period
├── Calculate Momentum Component
│   ├── Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Average of Past n Days' Volume-Weighted High-Low Spreads
│   └── Subtract past average from current value
├── Generate Final Factor
│   ├── Combine Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread and Momentum
│   │   └── Add the two components together
│   ├── Divide this combination by the Close price
├── Incorporate Price Trend
│   ├── Calculate n-Day Moving Average of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Sum of Close prices over the last n days
│   │   └── Divide by n to get the moving average
│   ├── Subtract n-Day Moving Average from the Current Close Price
│   └── Multiply the result by the generated factor
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   └── Use Close price
│       └── Calculate n-day log return
├── Calculate Enhanced Volume-Weighted Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Volatility
│   │   └── Use Open, High, Low, and Close prices
│   │       └── Calculate average true range over n days
│   └── Weight by Volume
│       └── Multiply Volatility by logarithm of Volume
├── Calculate Trade Frequency Adjusted Return
│   ├── Count daily trades using Volume
│   └── Calculate n-day return adjusted by square root of trade frequency
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Multiply Price Momentum by Enhanced Volume-Weighted Volatility
│   ├── Add Trade Frequency Adjusted Return
│   └── Apply a nonlinear transformation to the sum (e.g., square root)
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply the combined factor from the first tree by the transformed value from the second tree
