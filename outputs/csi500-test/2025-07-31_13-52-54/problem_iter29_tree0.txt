Crossover of Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio and Trend Following with Momentum, Volume Intensity, and Enhanced Alpha Factor
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High price
├── Compute Volume-Weighted Price
│   ├── Sum of (Close price * Volume)
│   └── Total Volume
├── Compute Ratio
│   ├── Divide High-Low Spread by Volume-Weighted Price
│   └── Output: Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
├── Develop trend following alpha factor using close prices
│   ├── Calculate the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices
│   ├── Generate a binary signal; 1 if the current close is above the SMA, -1 if below, and 0 if equal
├── Explore momentum in high and low prices
│   ├── Calculate the difference between today’s high and the previous day’s high
│   ├── Calculate the difference between today’s low and the previous day’s low
│   ├── Sum the differences to get a combined momentum score
│   ├── Create a simple threshold to classify stocks as having strong positive or negative momentum based on the score
│   │   ├── Assign a value of 1 for strong positive momentum, -1 for strong negative momentum, and 0 for neutral momentum
├── Analyze volume patterns
│   ├── Calculate the daily volume percentage change from the previous day
│   ├── Use a threshold to classify the volume change into strong, moderate, or weak categories
├── Leverage price and volume for an intensity factor
│   ├── Multiply the return (close to close) by the volume traded
│   ├── Interpret the result as a measure of market participant intensity
│   ├── Smooth out short-term fluctuations using a moving average of this intensity factor over the past 20 days
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Multiply (High - Low) by Volume
│   └── Sum of these values over the lookback period
├── Calculate Momentum Component
│   ├── Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Average of Past n Days' Volume-Weighted High-Low Spreads
│   ├── Subtract past average from current value
├── Generate Intermediate Factor
│   ├── Add the Momentum Component and Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Divide this combination by the Close price
├── Incorporate Price Trend
│   ├── Calculate n-Day Moving Average of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Sum of Close prices over the last n days
│   │   └── Divide by n to get the moving average
│   ├── Subtract n-Day Moving Average from the Current Close Price
│   └── Multiply the result by the generated intermediate factor
├── Synthesize Factors
    ├── Combine the Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio, 50-day SMA trend signal, combined momentum score, and volume intensity factor
    ├── Weighted sum of trend, momentum, and intensity factors
    ├── Use Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread Ratio as a modifier to adjust the final alpha factor
    └── Output: A composite alpha factor integrating multiple aspects of price and volume behavior
