- Sub-Thought: Volume Weighted Moving Average
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Simple Moving Average
    - Sub-Thought: Use Close price for last N days
  - Sub-Thought: Weight by Volume
    - Sub-Thought: Use Volume for last N days
    - Sub-Thought: Multiply each Close price by its Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Sum of weighted close prices

    - Sub-Thought: Calculate n-day return
- Sub-Thought: Adjust for Volume Surge
  - Sub-Thought: Determine N-day Volume Change
    - Sub-Thought: Use Volume of today
    - Sub-Thought: Subtract Volume of N days ago
  - Sub-Thought: Determine M-day Volume Change
    - Sub-Thought: Use Volume of today
    - Sub-Thought: Subtract Volume of M days ago
  - Sub-Thought: Combine Changes
    - Sub-Thought: Sum N-day and M-day volume changes
  - Sub-Thought: If Volume Surge is negative, apply a penalty
    - Sub-Thought: Multiply by 0.8
- Sub-Thought: Final Combined Alpha Factor
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply Price Momentum by Volume-Weighted Volatility
  - Sub-Thought: Add Intraday Range Growth
