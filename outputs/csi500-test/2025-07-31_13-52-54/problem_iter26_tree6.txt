Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread and Momentum with Price Trend, Enhanced Volatility, and Trade Frequency Adjustments
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High price
│   ├── Multiply (High - Low) by Volume
│   └── Sum of these values over the lookback period
├── Compute Volume-Averaged Price
│   ├── Sum of (Close price * Volume)
│   └── Total Volume
├── Compute Ratio
│   ├── Divide Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread by Volume-Averaged Price
│   └── Output: Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread Ratio
