Thought: Integrated Volume-Price Momentum with Intraday and Long-Term Adjustments
- Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Returns
  - Use Close price of current day
  - Use Close price of previous day
- Sub-Thought: Long-Term Volume-Weighted Average Return (Momentum)
  - Sum of (Daily Returns * Volume) for the last 120 days
  - Divide by the total volume over the 120 days
- Sub-Thought: Short-Term Volume-Weighted Average Return (Reversal)
  - Sum of (Daily Returns * Volume) for the last 7 days
  - Divide by the total volume over the 7 days
- Sub-Thought: High-Low Spread
  - Subtract Low from High price
- Sub-Thought: Volume-Averaged Price
  - Sum of (Close price * Volume)
  - Total Volume
- Sub-Thought: Compute Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
  - Divide High-Low Spread by Volume-Averaged Price
  - Output: Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices
- Sub-Thought: Generate a binary signal; 1 if the current close is above the SMA, -1 if below, and 0 if equal
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today’s high and the previous day’s high
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today’s low and the previous day’s low
- Sub-Thought: Sum the differences to get a combined momentum score
- Sub-Thought: Create a simple threshold to classify stocks as having strong positive or negative momentum based on the score
  - Assign a value of 1 for strong positive momentum, -1 for strong negative momentum, and 0 for neutral momentum
- Sub-Thought: Integrate the Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio with the trend following and momentum signals
  - Combine the binary SMA signal, momentum score, and Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
  - Use a weighted sum to create a final factor
  - Output: Integrated Alpha Factor
- Sub-Thought: Intraday Momentum
  - (High - Low) / Open
  - Multiply by Volume
  - Sum(Intraday Momentum) over 7 days
- Sub-Thought: Volume-Weighted Intraday Reversal
  - -(Intraday Momentum)
  - Sum(-(Intraday Momentum)) over 15 days
- Sub-Thought: Combined Alpha Factor
  - (Long-Term Volume-Weighted Average Return - Short-Term Volume-Weighted Average Return)
  - + (Intraday Momentum + Volume-Weighted Intraday Reversal)
- Sub-Thought: Adjusted Intraday High-Low Spread
  - (High - Low) * Volume
  - Add Close to (Volume * (High - Low))
- Sub-Thought: Final Enhanced Alpha Factor
  - Multiply Combined Alpha Factor by Adjusted Intraday High-Low Spread
  - Add the result to the Integrated Alpha Factor
  - Output: Final Enhanced Alpha Factor
- Sub-Thought: Analyze volume patterns
  - Calculate the daily volume percentage change from the previous day
  - Assign a value indicating strong buying (positive change) or selling (negative change) pressure
    - Use a threshold to classify the volume change into strong, moderate, or weak categories
- Sub-Thought: Leverage price and volume for an intensity factor
  - Multiply the return (close to close) by the volume traded
  - Interpret the result as a measure of market participant intensity
    - A high positive value suggests strong buying interest, while a high negative value indicates strong selling pressure
    - Use a moving average of this intensity factor over the past 20 days to smooth out short-term fluctuations
- Sub-Thought: Combine the intensity factor with the final enhanced alpha factor
  - Add the smoothed intensity factor to the final enhanced alpha factor
  - Output: Final Integrated Alpha Factor
