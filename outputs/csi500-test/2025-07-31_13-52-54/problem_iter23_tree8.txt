Thought: Integrated Alpha Factor Synthesizing Trend, Momentum, and Volume
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices
  - Sub-Thought: Sum of Close prices over the last 50 days
  - Sub-Thought: Divide by 50 to get the moving average
- Sub-Thought: Generate a binary trend signal; 1 if the current close is above the SMA, 0 otherwise
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the High-Low Spread
  - Sub-Thought: Subtract Low from High price
- Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume-Average Price
  - Sub-Thought: Sum of (Close price * Volume)
  - Sub-Thought: Total Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Divide the sum by Total Volume
- Sub-Thought: Compute Ratio
  - Sub-Thought: Divide High-Low Spread by Volume-Average Price
  - Output: Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today’s high and the previous day’s high
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today’s low and the previous day’s low
- Sub-Thought: Sum the differences to get a combined momentum score
- Sub-Thought: Create a simple threshold to classify stocks as having positive or negative momentum based on the score
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily volume percentage change from the previous day
- Sub-Thought: Assign a value indicating strong buying (positive change) or selling (negative change) pressure
- Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply (High - Low) by Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Sum of these values over the lookback period
- Sub-Thought: Calculate Momentum Component
  - Sub-Thought: Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
  - Sub-Thought: Average of Past n Days' Volume-Weighted High-Low Spreads
  - Sub-Thought: Subtract past average from current value
- Sub-Thought: Generate Final Factor
  - Sub-Thought: Add the Momentum Component and Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
  - Sub-Thought: Divide this combination by the Close price
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate Price Trend
  - Sub-Thought: Subtract 50-Day SMA from the Current Close Price
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply the result by the generated factor
- Sub-Thought: Combine all factors into a composite alpha factor
  - Sub-Thought: Weighted sum of trend, momentum, and intensity factors
  - Sub-Thought: Use Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio as a modifier to adjust the final alpha factor
  - Output: Composite Alpha Factor
