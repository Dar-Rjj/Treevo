Combined Price-Volume and High-Low Spread Momentum Indicator
├── Calculate Combined Momentum
│   ├── Multiply High price by Volume
│   ├── Sum of (High price * Volume) over the past n days
│   └── Subtract Sum of (Low price * Volume) over the past n days
├── Calculate Price-Volume Smoothed Average
│   ├── Multiply Close price by Volume
│   ├── Sum of (Close price * Volume) over the past m days
│   └── Divide by Total Volume over the past m days
├── Compute Momentum to Smoothed Average Ratio
│   ├── Divide Combined Momentum by Price-Volume Smoothed Average
│   └── Intermediate Output: Combined Momentum to Smoothed Average Ratio
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High price
└── Calculate Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread
    ├── Multiply High-Low Spread by Volume
    └── Sum of (High-Low Spread * Volume) over the past o days
└── Compute Final Ratio
    ├── Divide Intermediate Output by Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread
    └── Output: Combined Momentum to Smoothed Average and Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
