    ├── Multiply the combined factor from the first tree by the transformed value from the second tree
└── Calculate the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices
    ├── Identify the period for SMA calculation, e.g., 50 days
└── Determine the current stock's position relative to its SMA
    ├── Generate a binary signal; 1 if the current close is above the SMA, -1 if below, and 0 if equal
└── Explore Momentum in High and Low Prices
    ├── Calculate the difference between today’s high and the previous day’s high
    ├── Calculate the difference between today’s low and the previous day’s low
