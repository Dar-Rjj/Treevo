Thought: Synthesize alpha factors from daily price and volume data to predict future stock returns
- Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between closing price and opening price as a simple indicator of daily stock movement
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the 5-day moving average of the daily price difference
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute the 20-day standard deviation of the 5-day moving average of the daily price difference
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Divide the 5-day moving average of the daily price difference by its 20-day standard deviation to measure the volatility-adjusted trend strength
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the 14-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the closing prices
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute the difference between the current closing price and the 14-day EMA
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Use the difference as an indication of the distance from the recent trend
  - Sub-sub-thought: Count the number of days in the past month where the closing price was above the opening price
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of up-days to total days as a measure of recent market sentiment
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the highest high and lowest low over the last 20 days
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute the range percentage as (highest high - lowest low) / lowest low
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the sum of volume on days when the closing price is higher than the opening price, divided by the total volume over the same period
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: This ratio indicates the relative buying pressure
  - Sub-sub-thought: For each day, calculate the return based on the close-to-close price change
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute the cumulative return over the past 30 trading days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the rate of change of the amount traded over the past 7 days
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Identify whether there's a significant increase or decrease in transaction amount which could signal changes in investor interest
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the average true range (ATR) over the past 14 days
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compare today's ATR with the 14-day ATR to gauge today's volatility relative to recent history
  - Sub-sub-thought: Determine the direction and magnitude of the price gap (difference between today's open and yesterday's close)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Categorize the gaps into up, down, or no gap for pattern recognition
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of high price to low price for the day
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Use this daily ratio to identify potential breakout or consolidation patterns
  - Sub-sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between the day's high and the 20-day moving average of the closing price
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Determine if the high is significantly above or below the moving average, indicating potential bullish or bearish signals
- Sub-thought: Calculate High-Low Spread
  - Sub-sub-thought: Subtract Low from High price
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Sum of (Close price * Volume) / Total Volume
- Sub-thought: Compute Ratio
  - Sub-sub-thought: Divide High-Low Spread by VWAP
  - Sub-sub-thought: Output: Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
- Sub-thought: Combine the Volatility-Adjusted Trend Strength and Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create a composite factor by multiplying the Volatility-Adjusted Trend Strength with the Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
  - Sub-sub-thought: Use this composite factor to predict future stock returns
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 5-day moving average of the daily trading amount
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the 20-day standard deviation of the 5-day moving average of the daily trading amount
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Divide the 5-day moving average of the daily trading amount by its 20-day standard deviation to measure the volatility-adjusted trading activity
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compare the 5-day moving average of the daily trading amount with the 20-day moving average of the daily trading amount
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Determine if the current trading activity is above or below the long-term average to identify potential changes in market dynamics
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 5-day moving average of the daily volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the 20-day standard deviation of the 5-day moving average of the daily volume
    - Sub-sub-sub-th
