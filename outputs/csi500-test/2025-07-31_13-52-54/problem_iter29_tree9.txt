Thought: Synthesize Volume-Weighted and Averaged High-Low Spread, Momentum, Price Trend, and Enhanced Volatility Adjustments with Trend, Momentum, and Volume for an Enhanced Alpha Factor
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High price
├── Compute Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Multiply (High - Low) by Volume
│   └── Sum of these values over the lookback period
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close Price
│   ├── Sum of (Close price * Volume)
├── Compute Ratio
│   ├── Divide Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread by Volume-Weighted Close Price
├── Calculate Momentum Component
│   ├── Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Average of Past n Days' Volume-Weighted High-Low Spreads
│   └── Subtract past average from current value
├── Generate Interim Factor
│   ├── Combine Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread and Momentum
│   │   └── Add the two components together
│   ├── Divide this combination by the Volume-Weighted Close Price
├── Incorporate Price Trend
│   ├── Calculate n-Day Moving Average of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Sum of Close prices over the last n days
│   │   └── Divide by n to get the moving average
│   ├── Subtract n-Day Moving Average from the Current Close Price
│   └── Multiply the result by the interim factor
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   └── Use Close price
│       └── Calculate n-day log return
├── Calculate Enhanced Volume-Weighted Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Volatility
│   │   └── Use Open, High, Low, and Close prices
│   │       └── Calculate standard deviation over n days
│   └── Weight by Volume
│       └── Multiply Volatility by logarithm of Volume
├── Calculate Trade Frequency Adjusted Return
│   ├── Count daily trades using Volume
│   └── Calculate n-day return adjusted by square root of trade frequency
├── Calculate 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of closing prices
├── Generate a binary trend signal; 1 if the current close is above the EMA, 0 otherwise
├── Calculate the difference between today’s high and the previous day's high
├── Calculate the difference between today’s low and the previous day's low
├── Sum the differences to get a combined momentum score
├── Create a simple threshold to classify stocks as having positive or negative momentum based on the score
├── Calculate the daily volume percentage change from the previous day
├── Assign a value indicating strong buying (positive change) or selling (negative change) pressure
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Multiply Price Momentum by Enhanced Volume-Weighted Volatility
│   ├── Add Trade Frequency Adjusted Return
│   └── Apply a nonlinear transformation to the sum (e.g., square)
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply the combined factor from the first tree by the transformed value from the second tree
    ├── Multiply the result by the binary trend signal
    ├── Multiply the result by the combined momentum score
    ├── Multiply the result by the volume percentage change
    └── Output: Composite Alpha Factor
