Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread with Momentum, Price Trend, and Volume Intensity
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High price
├── Compute Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Multiply (High - Low) by Volume
│   └── Sum of these values over the lookback period
├── Calculate Volume-Averaged Close Price
│   ├── Sum of (Close price * Volume)
│   └── Total Volume
├── Compute Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread Ratio
│   ├── Divide Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread by Volume-Averaged Close Price
│   └── Output: Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread Ratio
├── Calculate Momentum Component
│   ├── Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Average of Past n Days' Volume-Weighted High-Low Spreads
│   └── Subtract past average from current value
├── Generate Preliminary Factor
│   ├── Add Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread Ratio and Momentum
├── Incorporate Price Trend
│   ├── Calculate n-Day Moving Average of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Sum of Close prices over the last n days
│   │   └── Divide by n to get the moving average
│   ├── Subtract n-Day Moving Average from the Current Close Price
│   └── Multiply the result by the generated factor
├── Calculate Intraday Range Growth
│   ├── Today's High-Low Range
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Use Low price
│   ├── Previous Day's High-Low Range
│   │   ├── Use High price (lagged by 1)
│   │   └── Use Low price (lagged by 1)
│   └── Compute Intraday Range Growth
│       ├── Subtract Previous Day's High-Low Range from Today's High-Low Range
│       └── Divide by Previous Day's High-Low Range
├── Adjust for Volume Surge
│   ├── Determine N-day Volume Change
│   │   ├── Use Volume of today
│   │   └── Subtract Volume of N days ago
│   ├── Determine M-day Volume Change
│   │   ├── Use Volume of today
│   │   └── Subtract Volume of M days ago
│   └── Combine Changes
│       ├── Sum N-day and M-day volume changes
│   └── If Volume Surge is negative, apply a penalty
│       └── Multiply by 0.8
├── Leverage Price and Volume for an Intensity Factor
│   ├── Multiply the return (close to close) by the volume traded
│   ├── Use a moving average of this intensity factor over the past 20 days to smooth out short-term fluctuations
└── Synthesize Factors
    ├── Combine the Volume-Weighted High-Low Spread Ratio, Preliminary Factor, Intraday Range Growth, Adjusted Volume Surge, and Volume-Intensity Factor
    └── Output: A composite alpha factor integrating multiple aspects of price and volume behavior
