Thought: Synthesized Alpha Factor with Momentum and Volume Intensity
├── Calculate Weighted High-Low Spread Adjusted for Volume
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
│   ├── Multiply by (Volume / Average Volume of Last 5 Days)
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract previous period's Close price from current Close price
├── Divide Price Momentum by Weighted High-Low Spread Adjusted for Volume
├── Generate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Closing Prices
│   ├── Identify the period for SMA calculation, e.g., 50 days
├── Determine Stock Position Relative to its SMA
│   ├── Generate a binary signal; 1 if the current close is above the SMA, 0 otherwise
├── Calculate High and Low Momentum
│   ├── Calculate the difference between today’s high and the previous day’s high
│   ├── Calculate the difference between today’s low and the previous day’s low
│   ├── Sum the differences to get a combined momentum score
├── Classify Stocks Based on Momentum Score
│   ├── Create a simple threshold to classify stocks as having positive or negative momentum based on the score
├── Evaluate Volume Patterns
│   ├── Calculate the percentage change in volume from the previous day
├── Infer Trading Activity and Sentiment from Volume
│   ├── Assign a value indicating strong buying (positive change) or selling (negative change) pressure
├── Leverage Price and Volume for an Intensity Factor
│   ├── Multiply the return (close to close) by the volume traded
│   ├── Interpret the result as a measure of market participant intensity
│   │   ├── A high positive value suggests strong buying interest, while a high negative value indicates strong selling pressure
└── Combine Factors into a Single Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine the divided price momentum, position relative to SMA, high-low momentum, and volume intensity
    ├── Create a weighted sum of these factors to form a final alpha factor
