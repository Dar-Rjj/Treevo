Performing Alpha Mining for Novel and Interpretable Factors
- Use Price Data (Open, High, Low, Close)
  - Daily Log Returns
    - Calculate using Close Prices: Log(Close_t / Close_{t-1})
  - Moving Averages of Log Returns
    - Short-Term (5-day) Moving Average
    - Long-Term (20-day) Moving Average
    - Momentum Factor: Short-Term MA - Long-Term MA
  - Volatility Measures
    - Historical Volatility: 20-day Standard Deviation of Log Returns
    - Exponential Weighted Moving Average of Log Returns (12-period)
  - Price Patterns
    - Bullish Engulfing: Close_t > Open_{t-1} and Open_t < Close_{t-1}
    - Bearish Engulfing: Close_t < Open_{t-1} and Open_t > Close_{t-1}
    - Inside Bar: High_t < High_{t-1} and Low_t > Low_{t-1}
- Use Volume Data
  - Volume Changes: (Volume_t / Volume_{t-1} - 1)
  - Volume-Based Momentum
    - 5-day and 20-day Moving Averages
    - Volume Momentum: Short-Term MA - Long-Term MA
  - Volume Patterns
    - Volume Spike: Volume_t > 2 * Volume_{t-1}
    - Volume Divergence: Volume_t > Volume_{t-1} and Close_t < Close_{t-1}
- Use Amount Data
  - Dollar Volume: Close Price * Volume
  - Dollar Volume Changes: (DollarVolume_t / DollarVolume_{t-1} - 1)
  - Dollar Volume Patterns
    - Dollar Volume Spike: DollarVolume_t > 2 * DollarVolume_{t-1}
    - Dollar Volume Divergence: DollarVolume_t > DollarVolume_{t-1} and Close_t < Close_{t-1}
- Composite Factors
  - Combined Momentum: Weighted Sum of Price, Volume, and Dollar Volume Momentum
  - Trend Strength
    - ADX: Average Directional Index
  - Relative Strength: Ratio of Stock's Close to Benchmark's Close
  - Advanced Composite Factors
    - Combined Trend and Momentum: Weighted Sum of ADX and Combined Momentum
    - Combined Price and Volume Patterns
      - Indicator: (Bullish Engulfing AND Volume Spike) OR (Bearish Engulfing AND Volume Spike) OR (Inside Bar AND Volume Divergence)
    - Combined Price and Dollar Volume Patterns
      - Indicator: (Bullish Engulfing AND Dollar Volume Spike) OR (Bearish Engulfing AND Dollar Volume Spike) OR (Inside Bar AND Dollar Volume Divergence)
