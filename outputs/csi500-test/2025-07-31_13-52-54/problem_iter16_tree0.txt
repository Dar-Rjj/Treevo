Performing Alpha Mining for Novel and Interpretable Factors
- Use Price Data (Open, High, Low, Close)
  - Daily Log Returns
    - Calculate using Close Prices
      - Log(Close_t / Close_{t-1})
  - Moving Averages of Log Returns
    - Short-Term (e.g., 5-day) Moving Average
    - Long-Term (e.g., 20-day) Moving Average
    - Momentum Factor: Difference between Short-Term and Long-Term Moving Averages
  - Volatility Measures
    - Historical Volatility: Standard Deviation of Log Returns (e.g., 20-day window)
    - Exponential Weighted Moving Average of Log Returns (e.g., 12-period)
- Use Volume Data
  - Volume Changes
    - Percentage Change in Volume
      - (Volume_t / Volume_{t-1} - 1)
  - Volume-Based Momentum
    - Moving Average of Volume (e.g., 5-day and 20-day)
    - Volume Momentum: Difference between Short-Term and Long-Term Moving Averages
- Use Amount Data
  - Dollar Volume
    - Close Price * Volume
  - Dollar Volume Changes
    - Percentage Change in Dollar Volume
      - (DollarVolume_t / DollarVolume_{t-1} - 1)
- Composite Factors
  - Combined Momentum
    - Weighted Sum of Price Momentum, Volume Momentum, and Dollar Volume Momentum
  - Trend Strength
    - Directional Movement Index (DMI)
      - Calculate +DM, -DM, and TR (True Range)
      - Smoothed +DI, -DI, and DX
      - ADX (Average Directional Index)
  - Relative Strength
    - Relative Strength Line (Close price relative to a benchmark or index)
      - Ratio of Stock's Close to Benchmark's Close
