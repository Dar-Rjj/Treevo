Thought: Synthesize Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio and Trend Following with Momentum Analysis
- Sub-Thought: Calculate High-Low Spread
  - Subtract Low from High price
- Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume-Average Price
  - Sum of (Close price * Volume)
  - Total Volume
- Sub-Thought: Compute Ratio
  - Divide High-Low Spread by Volume-Average Price
  - Output: Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices
- Sub-Thought: Generate a binary signal; 1 if the current close is above the SMA, -1 if below, and 0 if equal
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today’s high and the previous day’s high
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today’s low and the previous day’s low
- Sub-Thought: Sum the differences to get a combined momentum score
- Sub-Thought: Create a simple threshold to classify stocks as having strong positive or negative momentum based on the score
  - Assign a value of 1 for strong positive momentum, -1 for strong negative momentum, and 0 for neutral momentum
- Sub-Thought: Integrate the Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio with the trend following and momentum signals
  - Combine the binary SMA signal, momentum score, and Volume-Averaged High-Low Spread Ratio
  - Use a weighted sum to create a final factor
  - Output: Integrated Alpha Factor
- Sub-Thought: Analyze volume patterns
  - Calculate the daily volume percentage change from the previous day
  - Assign a value indicating strong buying (positive change) or selling (negative change) pressure
    - Use a threshold to classify the volume change into strong, moderate, or weak categories
- Sub-Thought: Leverage price and volume for an intensity factor
  - Multiply the return (close to close) by the volume traded
  - Interpret the result as a measure of market participant intensity
    - A high positive value suggests strong buying interest, while a high negative value indicates strong selling pressure
    - Use a moving average of this intensity factor over the past 20 days to smooth out short-term fluctuations
- Sub-Thought: Combine the intensity factor with the integrated alpha factor
  - Add the smoothed intensity factor to the integrated alpha factor
  - Output: Final Enhanced Alpha Factor
