Thought: Synthesize Price Patterns and Volume-Weighted Momentum
- Sub-thought: Calculate Moving Averages with Volume Consideration
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume Weighted Simple Moving Average (VWSMA) of Close Prices
    - Calculation: VWSMA_10 = Sum(Close[i] * Volume[i] for i in range(t-9, t+1)) / Sum(Volume[i] for i in range(t-9, t+1))
    - Calculation: VWSMA_20 = Sum(Close[i] * Volume[i] for i in range(t-19, t+1)) / Sum(Volume[i] for i in range(t-19, t+1))
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume Weighted Exponential Moving Average (VWEMA) of Close Prices
    - Calculation: VWEMA_10 = (Close[t] * Volume[t] * (2 / (1 + 10))) + (VWEMA_10[t-1] * (1 - (2 / (1 + 10))))
    - Calculation: VWEMA_20 = (Close[t] * Volume[t] * (2 / (1 + 20))) + (VWEMA_20[t-1] * (1 - (2 / (1 + 20))))
- Sub-thought: Analyze Volatility with Volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume Adjusted True Range
    - Calculation: V_TR = Max(High[t], Close[t-1]) - Min(Low[t], Close[t-1]) * Volume[t]
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume Adjusted Average True Range (V_ATR)
    - Calculation: V_ATR_14 = (Sum(V_TR[i] for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 14)
- Sub-thought: Identify Breakouts with Volume Confirmation
  - Sub-sub-thought: New Highs or Lows with Volume Spike
    - Calculation: If High[t] > Max(High[i] for i in range(t-5, t)) and Volume[t] > Average(Volume[i] for i in range(t-5, t)), then New_High = True
    - Calculation: If Low[t] < Min(Low[i] for i in range(t-5, t)) and Volume[t] > Average(Volume[i] for i in range(t-5, t)), then New_Low = True
- Sub-thought: Measure Momentum with Volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume Adjusted Rate of Change (V_ROC) of Close Prices
    - Calculation: V_ROC_12 = (Close[t] - Close[t-12]) / Close[t-12] * (Volume[t] / Average(Volume[i] for i in range(t-12, t+1)))
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume Adjusted Relative Strength Index (V_RSI)
    - Calculation: V_RSI_14 = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Average Gain * Volume[t] / Average Loss * Average(Volume[i] for i in range(t-13, t+1)))))
      - Where:
        - Average Gain = Sum(Max(Close[i] - Close[i-1], 0) for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 14
        - Average Loss = Abs(Sum(Min(Close[i] - Close[i-1], 0) for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 14)
- Sub-thought: Assess Volume Changes with Price Oscillations
  - Sub-sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV) with Price Oscillation
    - Calculation: OBV[t] = OBV[t-1] + (Volume[t] if Close[t] > Close[t-1] else (-Volume[t] if Close[t] < Close[t-1] else 0))
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Trading Volume with Crossover
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) with Crossover
    - Calculation: VWAP = Sum((High[i] + Low[i] + Close[i]) / 3 * Volume[i] for i in range(t-1, t+1)) / Sum(Volume[i] for i in range(t-1, t+1))
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compare VWAP and VWSMA
    - Calculation: If VWAP > VWSMA_10, generate Buy Signal
    - Calculation: If VWAP < VWSMA_10, generate Sell Signal
- Sub-thought: Combine Signals for Final Decision
  - Sub-sub-thought: Combine VWAP and VWSMA Crossover
    - Calculation
