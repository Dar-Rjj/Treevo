Calculate True Range and Daily Range
├── Get High, Low, and Previous Close prices
│   ├── Use High
│   ├── Use Low
│   └── Use Previous Close (if available, otherwise use Close)
├── Calculate TR1: High - Low
├── Calculate TR2: Abs(High - Previous Close)
├── Calculate TR3: Abs(Low - Previous Close)
├── True Range: Max(TR1, TR2, TR3)
└── Daily Range: High - Low

Calculate 14-Period Average True Range (ATR) and 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Range
├── Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
├── Divide by 14
├── Compute the average of Daily Ranges over the past 20 days

Identify Breakouts
├── If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
└── If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout

Calculate Breakout Strength
├── For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
└── For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range

Cumulate Breakout Strength
├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
└── Subtract sum of negative strengths from sum of positive strengths

Calculate 10-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── Compute 10-Day Close Price Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t-9
│   └── Use Close price of day t
├── Calculate 10-Day Volume Ratio
│   ├── Sum volume from day t-9 to day t
│   └── Divide by Average 10-Day Volume
└── Multiply Close Price Return by Volume Ratio

Calculate High-Low Price Oscillation
├── Compute High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Use Low price of day t
├── Calculate 20-Day Mean of High-Low Range
├── Calculate 20-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range
└── Adjust Price Oscillation
    ├── Subtract 20-Day Mean of High-Low Range
    └── Divide by 20-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range

Calculate Intraday Volatility
├── Calculate (High - Low) / Open
└── Compute 10-Day Moving Average of Intraday Volatility

Combine Indicators
├── Sum Cumulated Breakout Strength, 10-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum, Adjusted Price Oscillation, and 10-Day Moving Average of Intraday Volatility
└── Evaluate the result
    ├── If result is positive, it indicates strong positive intraday and breakout momentum
    └── If result is negative, it shows the stock may be weakening
