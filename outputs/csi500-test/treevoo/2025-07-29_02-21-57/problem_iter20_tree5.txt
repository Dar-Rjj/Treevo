Calculate True Range and High-Low Spread
├── Get High, Low, and Previous Close prices
│   ├── Use High
│   ├── Use Low
│   └── Use Previous Close (if available, otherwise use Close)
├── Calculate TR1: High - Low
├── Calculate TR2: Abs(High - Previous Close)
├── Calculate TR3: Abs(Low - Previous Close)
└── True Range: Max(TR1, TR2, TR3)
    └── Average High-Low Spread: Sum of (High - Low) over a lookback period / Lookback Period

Calculate 14-Period Average True Range (ATR)
├── Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
└── Divide by 14

Calculate Close-to-Open Return
├── Subtract Open from Close

Calculate Price Momentum
├── Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close

Weight by Volume
├── Multiply Volume by Momentum

Adjust Momentum by ATR
├── Divide Weighted Momentum by ATR

Generate Alpha Factor
├── Add ATR Adjusted Momentum to Close-to-Open Return
└── Add Spread Relative Strength: Compare today's high-low spread with the recent average high-low spread

Explore Trend and Volatility Characteristics
├── Calculate the difference between close prices of two consecutive days (Momentum)
├── Determine the direction of the last X days' close prices (Trend Direction)
├── Measure the standard deviation of daily close-to-close returns over a period (Volatility)
├── Summarize the total volume traded in the past X days (Volume Accumulation)

Examine Opening and Closing Prices
├── Compute the number of up and down days, where an up day is defined as close > open (Up/Down Day Count)

Use Candlestick Patterns for Predictive Insights
├── Check for specific simple candlestick formations (e.g., doji, marubozu) and their occurrence frequency (Candlestick Pattern Frequency)
└── Determine the strength of these patterns by comparing the size of the real body to the high-low range (Pattern Strength)

Explore Historical Price Patterns
├── Calculate moving average of closing prices
│   ├── Short-term (e.g., 5-day) moving average
│   ├── Medium-term (e.g., 20-day) moving average
│   └── Long-term (e.g., 100-day) moving average
├── Compute the difference between short-term and long-term moving averages
├── Calculate the rate of change (ROC) for close prices
│   ├── ROC over 14 days
│   └── ROC over 28 days
└── Analyze the trend in high and low prices
    ├── Calculate the average true range (ATR) over a period (e.g., 14 days)

Examine Volume and Amount Data
├── Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) to track buying and selling pressure
├── Compute the money flow index (MFI) using high, low, close, and volume

Identify Volatility-Based Factors
├── Calculate standard deviation of daily returns over a period (e.g., 30 days)
└── Analyze the spread between high and low prices
    ├── Daily range (high - low)
    └── Average daily range over a period (e.g., 20 days)

Investigate Momentum and Acceleration
├── Calculate the relative strength index (RSI) to measure overbought/oversold levels
└── Compute the Chande momentum oscillator (CMO) to identify momentum changes

Incorporate Technical Indicators
├── Use the Bollinger Bands to assess volatility and potential breakout points
└── Apply the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to identify trends
