Synthesized High-Low Breakout with Intraday Momentum and Volume Impact
├── Calculate Daily Range
│   └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Range
│   └── Compute the average of Daily Ranges over the past 20 days
├── Identify Breakouts
│   ├── If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
│   └── If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout
├── Calculate Breakout Strength
│   ├── For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
│   └── For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
├── Cumulate Breakout Strength
│   └── Sum all positive and negative Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   └── Compute (Close - Open) / Open
├── Calculate Volume Impact
│   ├── Compute the ratio of today's volume to the 20-day moving average of volume
│   └── If ratio > 1.5, adjust Breakout Strength by multiplying by 1.5
├── Combine Indicators
    └── Sum Intraday High-Low Spread, Close-to-Open Return, and Cumulated Breakout Strength
        ├── If result is positive, it indicates strong positive intraday and breakout momentum
        └── If result is negative, it shows the stock may be weakening
