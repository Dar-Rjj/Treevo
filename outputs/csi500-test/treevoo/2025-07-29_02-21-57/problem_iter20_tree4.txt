Calculate True Range and High-Low Spread
├── Get High, Low, and Previous Close prices
│   ├── Use High
│   ├── Use Low
│   └── Use Previous Close (if available, otherwise use Close)
├── Calculate TR1: High - Low
├── Calculate TR2: Abs(High - Previous Close)
├── Calculate TR3: Abs(Low - Previous Close)
└── True Range: Max(TR1, TR2, TR3)
    └── Average High-Low Spread: Sum of (High - Low) over a lookback period / Lookback Period

Calculate 14-Period Average True Range (ATR)
├── Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
└── Divide by 14

Calculate Volume Weighted Moving Averages (VWMA)
├── Calculate Short-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
│   ├── Daily Close Prices
│   └── Volume Weighting
│       ├── Use Volume
│       └── Multiply Volume with Price
├── Calculate Long-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
│   ├── Daily Close Prices
│   └── Volume Weighting
│       ├── Use Volume
│       └── Multiply Volume with Price

Combined Crossover and Momentum Signal
├── Compare Short-Term VWMA and Long-Term VWMA
│   ├── If Short-Term VWMA > Long-Term VWMA, generate Buy Signal
│   └── If Short-Term VWMA < Long-Term VWMA, generate Sell Signal
├── Evaluate Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-Day Close Price Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price of day t-5
│   │   └── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Calculate 5-Day Volume Ratio
│       ├── Sum volume from day t-4 to day t
│       └── Divide by Average 5-Day Volume
│   ├── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is positive, generate Buy Signal
│   └── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is negative, generate Sell Signal
└── Combine Signals
    ├── If both VWMA Crossover and Volume Adjusted Momentum are Buy, strong Buy Signal
    ├── If both VWMA Crossover and Volume Adjusted Momentum are Sell, strong Sell Signal
    ├── If VWMA Crossover is Buy and Volume Adjusted Momentum is not, moderate Buy Signal
    ├── If VWMA Crossover is Sell and Volume Adjusted Momentum is not, moderate Sell Signal
    └── If there is no agreement, hold position

Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
├── Subtract Low from High

Calculate Close-to-Open Return
├── Subtract Open from Close

Calculate Price Momentum
├── Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close

Weight by Volume
├── Multiply Volume by Momentum

Adjust Momentum by ATR
├── Divide Weighted Momentum by ATR

Generate Alpha Factor
├── Add ATR Adjusted Momentum to VWAP
├── Include Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── If Intraday High-Low Spread is high, increase Alpha Factor
│   ├── If Intraday High-Low Spread is low, decrease Alpha Factor
├── Combine with Crossover and Momentum Signals
│   ├── If strong Buy or moderate Buy, increase Alpha Factor
│   ├── If strong Sell or moderate Sell, decrease Alpha Factor
│   └── If hold, maintain Alpha Factor
└── Add Spread Relative Strength: Compare today's high-low spread with the recent average high-low spread

Explore Trend and Volatility Characteristics
├── Calculate the difference between close prices of two consecutive days (Momentum)
├── Determine the direction of the last X days' close prices (Trend Direction)
├── Measure the standard deviation of daily close-to-close returns over a period (Volatility)
└── Summarize the total volume traded in the past X days (Volume Accumulation)

Examine Opening and Closing Prices
├── Compute the number of up and down days, where an up day is defined as close > open (Up/Down Day Count)

Use Candlestick Patterns for Predictive Insights
├── Check for specific simple candlestick formations (e.g., doji, marubozu) and their occurrence frequency (Candlestick Pattern Frequency)
└── Determine the strength of these patterns by comparing the size of the real body to the high-low range (Pattern Strength)
