Calculate True Range and Daily Range
├── Get High, Low, and Previous Close prices
│   ├── Use High
│   ├── Use Low
│   └── Use Previous Close (if available, otherwise use Close)
├── Calculate TR1: High - Low
├── Calculate TR2: Abs(High - Previous Close)
├── Calculate TR3: Abs(Low - Previous Close)
├── True Range: Max(TR1, TR2, TR3)
├── Subtract Low from High
└── Daily Range: High - Low

Calculate 14-Period Average True Range (ATR) and 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Range
├── Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
├── Divide by 14
├── Compute the average of Daily Ranges over the past 20 days

Identify Breakouts
├── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's High
└── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's Low
    ├── If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
    └── If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout

Calculate Breakout Strength
├── For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
└── For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range

Cumulate Breakout Strength
├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
└── Sum all negative Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
    └── Subtract sum of negative strengths from sum of positive strengths

Calculate Price Momentum
├── Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close

Weight by Volume
├── Multiply Volume by Momentum

Adjust Momentum by ATR
├── Divide Weighted Momentum by ATR

Generate Alpha Factor
├── Add ATR Adjusted Momentum to Close-to-Open Return
├── Subtract Open from Close
└── Combine Indicators
    ├── Sum Intraday High-Low Spread, Close-to-Open Return, Cumulated Breakout Strength, and ATR Adjusted Momentum
    └── Evaluate the result
        ├── If result is positive, it indicates strong positive intraday and breakout momentum
        └── If result is negative, it shows the stock may be weakening

Volume-Filtered Momentum
├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-Day Close Price Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price of day t-5
│   │   └── Use Close price of day t
│   ├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Ratio
│   │   ├── Sum volume from day t-4 to day t
│   │   └── Divide by Average 5-Day Volume
│   └── Multiply Close Price Return by Volume Ratio

High-Low Price Oscillation
├── Compute High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Use Low price of day t
├── Calculate 10-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range
│   ├── Collect High-Low Ranges for 10 days
│   └── Compute Standard Deviation
└── Adjust Price Oscillation
    ├── Subtract 10-Day Mean of High-Low Range
    └── Divide by 10-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range

Compute Intraday Return
├── Use Open price of day t
└── Use Close price of day t

Compute Moving Averages
├── Short-Term (e.g., 5 days) of Intraday Returns
└── Long-Term (e.g., 20 days) of Intraday Returns

Compute Intraday Return Difference
├── Subtract Short-Term from Long-Term

Filter by Volume Change
├── Compute Volume Change
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Calculate difference between current and previous volume
└── Apply Condition
    ├── If Volume Change is positive, use Intraday Return Difference
    └── If Volume Change is negative, set to 0

Calculate Short-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
├── Daily Close Prices
└── Volume

Calculate Long-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
├── Daily Close Prices
└── Volume

Generate Combined Signal
├── Compare VWMA
│   ├── If Short-Term VWMA > Long-Term VWMA, Buy Signal
│   └── If Short-Term VWMA < Long-Term VWMA, Sell Signal
├── Evaluate Momentum
│   ├── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is positive, Buy Signal
│   └── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is negative, Sell Signal
