Calculate True Range and Daily Range
├── Use High, Low, and Previous Close (if available, otherwise use Close)
├── Calculate TR1: High - Low
├── Calculate TR2: Abs(High - Previous Close)
├── Calculate TR3: Abs(Low - Previous Close)
├── True Range: Max(TR1, TR2, TR3)
└── Daily Range: High - Low

Calculate 14-Period Average True Range (ATR) and 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Range
├── Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
├── Divide by 14 to get ATR
└── Compute the average of Daily Ranges over the past 20 days

Identify Breakouts
├── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's High
└── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's Low
    ├── If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
    └── If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout

Calculate Breakout Strength
├── For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
└── For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range

Cumulate Breakout Strength
├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
└── Sum all negative Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
    └── Subtract sum of negative strengths from sum of positive strengths

Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
├── Subtract Low from High

Calculate Close-to-Open Return
├── Compute (Close - Open) / Open

Calculate Volume Impact
├── Compute the ratio of today's volume to the 20-day moving average of volume
└── If ratio > 1.5, adjust Breakout Strength by multiplying by 1.5

Calculate Price Momentum
├── Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close

Adjust Momentum by ATR
├── Divide Price Momentum by ATR

Generate Alpha Factor
├── Combine Indicators
    ├── Weighted Sum: Intraday High-Low Spread * 0.3 + Close-to-Open Return * 0.2 + Cumulated Breakout Strength * 0.3 + ATR Adjusted Momentum * 0.2
    └── Evaluate the result
        ├── If result is positive, it indicates strong positive intraday and breakout momentum
        └── If result is negative, it shows the stock may be weakening
