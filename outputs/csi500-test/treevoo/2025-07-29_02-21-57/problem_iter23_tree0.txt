Thought: Explore Price Patterns and Volume Indicators
- Sub-thought: Calculate Moving Averages
  - Sub-sub-thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
    - Calculation: SMA_10 = Sum(Close[i] for i in range(t-9, t+1)) / 10
    - Calculation: SMA_20 = Sum(Close[i] for i in range(t-19, t+1)) / 20
  - Sub-sub-thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices
    - Calculation: EMA_10 = (Close[t] * (2 / (1 + 10))) + (EMA_10[t-1] * (1 - (2 / (1 + 10))))
    - Calculation: EMA_20 = (Close[t] * (2 / (1 + 20))) + (EMA_20[t-1] * (1 - (2 / (1 + 20))))
- Sub-thought: Analyze Volatility
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate True Range
    - Calculation: TR = Max(High[t], Close[t-1]) - Min(Low[t], Close[t-1])
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate Average True Range (ATR)
    - Calculation: ATR_14 = (Sum(TR[i] for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 14)
- Sub-thought: Identify Breakouts
  - Sub-sub-thought: New Highs or Lows
    - Calculation: If High[t] > Max(High[i] for i in range(t-5, t)), then New_High = True
    - Calculation: If Low[t] < Min(Low[i] for i in range(t-5, t)), then New_Low = True
- Sub-thought: Measure Momentum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Rate of Change (ROC) of Close Prices
    - Calculation: ROC_12 = (Close[t] - Close[t-12]) / Close[t-12]
  - Sub-sub-thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Calculation: RSI_14 = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Average Gain / Average Loss)))
      - Where:
        - Average Gain = Sum(Max(Close[i] - Close[i-1], 0) for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 14
        - Average Loss = Abs(Sum(Min(Close[i] - Close[i-1], 0) for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 14)
- Sub-thought: Assess Volume Changes
  - Sub-sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Calculation: OBV[t] = OBV[t-1] + (Volume[t] if Close[t] > Close[t-1] else (-Volume[t] if Close[t] < Close[t-1] else 0))
- Sub-thought: Examine Price and Volume Relationships
  - Sub-sub-thought: Money Flow Index (MFI)
    - Calculation: MFI_14 = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Positive Money Flow / Negative Money Flow)))
      - Where:
        - Positive Money Flow = Sum(Raw Money Flow[i] if Raw Money Flow[i] > 0 for i in range(t-13, t+1))
        - Negative Money Flow = Abs(Sum(Raw Money Flow[i] if Raw Money Flow[i] < 0 for i in range(t-13, t+1)))
        - Raw Money Flow = (High[i] + Low[i] + Close[i]) / 3 * Volume[i]
  - Sub-sub-thought: Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL)
    - Calculation: ADL[t] = ADL[t-1] + ((Close[t] - Low[t]) - (High[t] - Close[t])) / (High[t] - Low[t]) * Volume[t] if High[t] != Low[t] else 0
- Sub-thought: Combine Indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculation: SMA_Crossover = SMA_10 - SMA_20
    - Calculation: EMA_Crossover = EMA_10 - EMA_20
  - Sub-sub-thought: Momentum and Volume Synchronization
    - Calculation: Momentum_Volume_Sync = ROC_12 * (OBV[t] - OBV[t-12])
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volatility Adjusted Momentum
    - Calculation: Vol_Adjusted_Momentum = ROC_12 / ATR_14
  - Sub
