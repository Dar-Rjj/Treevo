        ├── If all three (VWMA Crossover, Volume Adjusted Momentum, and 10-Day Price Oscillation) are Buy, strong Buy Signal
        ├── If all three (VWMA Crossover, Volume Adjusted Momentum, and 10-Day Price Oscillation) are Sell, strong Sell Signal
        ├── If two out of three signals are Buy, moderate Buy Signal
        ├── If two out of three signals are Sell, moderate Sell Signal
        └── If there is no clear agreement, hold position
