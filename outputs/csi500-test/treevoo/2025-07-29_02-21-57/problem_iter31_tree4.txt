Thought: Explore trend and momentum indicators
  Thought: Calculate Moving Averages to identify trends
    Sub-thought: Use Simple Moving Average (SMA) over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50)
    Sub-thought: Use Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50)
  Thought: Calculate Momentum Indicators
    Sub-thought: Price Momentum - use the percentage change in close price over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50)
    Sub-thought: Rate of Change (ROC) - use the ROC of close price over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50)
  Thought: Evaluate Volume-related indicators
    Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) over different periods
    Sub-thought: Use Volume Oscillator - difference between two volume SMAs (e.g., 5-day and 20-day)
  Thought: Analyze High and Low Prices
    Sub-thought: Calculate True Range (TR) - max(high - low, abs(high - prev_close), abs(low - prev_close))
    Sub-thought: Calculate Average True Range (ATR) - SMA of TR over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50)
  Thought: Identify Reversal Patterns
    Sub-thought: Inside Day - check if high is lower than previous high and low is higher than previous low
    Sub-thought: Outside Day - check if high is higher than previous high and low is lower than previous low
  Thought: Generate Combination Factors
    Sub-thought: Combine Moving Averages and Momentum - e.g., EMA(5) - EMA(50) + MOM(50)
    Sub-thought: Combine Volume and Price - e.g., VWAP * MOM(50)
