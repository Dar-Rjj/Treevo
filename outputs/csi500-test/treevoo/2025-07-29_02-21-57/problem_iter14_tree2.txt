Calculate Long-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
├── Daily Close Prices
└── Volume Weighting
    ├── Use Volume
    └── Multiply Volume with Price

Calculate 5-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── Compute 5-Day Close Price Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t-5
│   └── Use Close price of day t
├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Ratio
│   ├── Sum volume from day t-4 to day t
│   └── Divide by Average 5-Day Volume
└── Multiply Close Price Return by Volume Ratio

Calculate High-Low Price Oscillation
├── Compute High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Use Low price of day t
├── Calculate 5-Day Mean of High-Low Range
│   ├── Collect High-Low Ranges for 5 days
│   └── Compute Mean
└── Subtract 5-Day Mean of High-Low Range

Combined Crossover and Momentum Signal
├── Compare Short-Term VWMA and Long-Term VWMA
│   ├── If Short-Term VWMA > Long-Term VWMA, generate Buy Signal
│   └── If Short-Term VWMA < Long-Term VWMA, generate Sell Signal
├── Evaluate Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is positive, generate Buy Signal
│   └── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is negative, generate Sell Signal
├── Evaluate High-Low Price Oscillation
│   ├── If High-Low Price Oscillation > 0, generate Buy Signal
│   └── If High-Low Price Oscillation < 0, generate Sell Signal
└── Combine Signals
    ├── If all three signals (VWMA Crossover, Volume Adjusted Momentum, and High-Low Price Oscillation) are Buy, strong Buy Signal
    ├── If all three signals (VWMA Crossover, Volume Adjusted Momentum, and High-Low Price Oscillation) are Sell, strong Sell Signal
    ├── If two out of three signals are Buy, moderate Buy Signal
    ├── If two out of three signals are Sell, moderate Sell Signal
    └── If there is no agreement, hold position

Calculate 10-Day Price Volatility
├── Compute 10-Day Standard Deviation of Close Prices
│   ├── Collect Close prices for 10 days
│   └── Compute Standard Deviation
└── Normalize by 10-Day Average Close Price
    ├── Compute 10-Day Average Close Price
    └── Divide Standard Deviation by 10-Day Average Close Price

Evaluate 10-Day Price Volatility
├── If 10-Day Price Volatility is above a threshold, generate Volatile Signal
└── If 10-Day Price Volatility is below a threshold, generate Stable Signal

Combine All Signals
├── Include 10-Day Price Volatility Signal
│   ├── If Volatile, adjust Buy/Sell signals to be more cautious
│   └── If Stable, maintain original Buy/Sell signals
├── If all four signals (VWMA Crossover, Volume Adjusted Momentum, High-Low Price Oscillation, and 10-Day Price Volatility) are Buy, very strong Buy Signal
├── If all four signals (VWMA Crossover, Volume Adjusted Momentum, High-Low Price Oscillation, and 10-Day Price Volatility) are Sell, very strong Sell Signal
├── If three out of four signals are Buy, strong Buy Signal
├── If three out of four signals are Sell, strong Sell Signal
├── If two out of four signals are Buy, moderate Buy Signal
├── If two out of four signals are Sell, moderate Sell Signal
└── If there is no clear majority, hold position
