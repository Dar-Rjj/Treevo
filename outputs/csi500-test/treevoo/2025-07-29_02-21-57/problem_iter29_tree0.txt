Calculate 5-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── Compute 5-Day Close Price Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t-5
│   └── Use Close price of day t
├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Ratio
│   ├── Sum volume from day t-4 to day t
│   └── Divide by Average 5-Day Volume
└── Multiply Close Price Return by Volume Ratio

Calculate High-Low Price Oscillation
├── Compute High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Use Low price of day t
├── Calculate 10-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range
│   ├── Collect High-Low Ranges for 10 days
│   └── Compute Standard Deviation
└── Adjust Price Oscillation
    ├── Subtract 10-Day Mean of High-Low Range
    └── Divide by 10-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range

Calculate Intraday Return
├── Use Open price of day t
└── Use Close price of day t

Compute Moving Averages
├── Short-Term (e.g., 5 days) of Intraday Returns
└── Long-Term (e.g., 20 days) of Intraday Returns

Compute Intraday Return Difference
├── Subtract Short-Term from Long-Term

Filter by Volume Change
├── Compute Volume Change
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Calculate difference between current and previous volume
└── Apply Condition
    ├── If Volume Change is positive, use Intraday Return Difference
    └── If Volume Change is negative, set to 0

Calculate Short-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
├── Daily Close Prices
└── Volume

Calculate Long-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
├── Daily Close Prices
└── Volume

Generate Combined Signal
├── Compare VWMA
│   ├── If Short-Term VWMA > Long-Term VWMA, Buy Signal
│   └── If Short-Term VWMA < Long-Term VWMA, Sell Signal
├── Evaluate Momentum
│   ├── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is positive, Buy Signal
│   └── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is negative, Sell Signal
├── Incorporate Price Oscillation
│   ├── If Adjusted Price Oscillation is positive, Buy Signal
│   └── If Adjusted Price Oscillation is negative, Sell Signal
├── Incorporate Intraday Return Difference
│   ├── If Intraday Return Difference is positive, amplify the Buy Signal
│   └── If Intraday Return Difference is negative, amplify the Sell Signal
└── Combine
    ├── If VWMA, Momentum, Price Oscillation, and Intraday Return Difference are all Buy, Strong Buy
    ├── If VWMA, Momentum, Price Oscillation, and Intraday Return Difference are all Sell, Strong Sell
    ├── If VWMA, Momentum, and Price Oscillation are Buy but Intraday Return Difference is not, Moderate Buy
    ├── If VWMA, Momentum, and Price Oscillation are Sell but Intraday Return Difference is not, Moderate Sell
    ├── If VWMA and Momentum are Buy but Price Oscillation is not, and Intraday Return Difference is Buy, Moderate Buy
    ├── If VWMA and Momentum are Sell but Price Oscillation is not, and Intraday Return Difference is Sell, Moderate Sell
    ├── If VWMA is Buy and Momentum is not, but Price Oscillation is Buy and Intraday Return Difference is Buy, Moderate Buy
    ├── If VWMA is Sell and Momentum is not, but Price Oscillation is Sell and Intraday Return Difference is Sell, Moderate Sell
    └── If no agreement, Hold

Final Alpha Factor
├── If Strong Buy, return 1
├── If Strong Sell, return -1
├── If Moderate Buy, return 0.5
├── If Moderate Sell, return -0.5
└── If Hold, return 0

Detect Volume Spikes
├── Calculate 20-Day Average Volume
│   ├── Sum volume from day t-19 to day t
│   └── Divide by 20
├── Compare Day t Volume with 20-Day Average Volume
│   ├── If Day t Volume > 2 * 20-Day Average Volume, label as Volume Spike
│   └── Otherwise, no Volume Spike
└── Amplify Signals
    ├── If Volume Spike detected, amplify the current signal (Buy or Sell)
    └── If no Volume Spike, use standard signal
