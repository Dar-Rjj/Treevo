Analyze the relationship between price movements, trading volume, and True Range to predict future stock returns
- Sub-thought: Calculate the daily return based on close prices
  - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between today's close price and yesterday's close price
- Sub-thought: Examine the impact of trading volume on stock returns
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the average daily trading volume over the past N days
  - Sub-thought: Compare today's volume with the average volume to identify unusual trading activity
- Sub-thought: Identify patterns in high and low prices using True Range
  - Sub-thought: Use High, Low, and Previous Close (if available, otherwise use Close)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate TR1: High - Low
    - Sub-thought: Calculate TR2: Abs(High - Previous Close)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate TR3: Abs(Low - Previous Close)
    - Sub-thought: True Range: Max(TR1, TR2, TR3)
  - Sub-thought: Measure the volatility by analyzing the standard deviation of True Ranges over the past M days
- Sub-thought: Combine price, volume, and True Range information to create a composite factor
  - Sub-thought: Create a weighted sum of the daily return, normalized volume change, and True Range
- Sub-thought: Use the open price to predict intraday momentum
  - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between today's open price and yesterday's close price
  - Sub-thought: Integrate this difference into the composite factor
- Sub-thought: Calculate 14-Period Average True Range (ATR) and 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Range
  - Sub-thought: Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
  - Sub-thought: Divide by 14 to get ATR
  - Sub-thought: Compute the average of Daily Ranges over the past 20 days
- Sub-thought: Identify Breakouts
  - Sub-thought: Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's High
  - Sub-thought: Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's Low
    - Sub-thought: If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
    - Sub-thought: If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout
- Sub-thought: Calculate Breakout Strength
  - Sub-thought: For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
  - Sub-thought: For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
- Sub-thought: Cumulate Breakout Strength
  - Sub-thought: Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
  - Sub-thought: Sum all negative Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
  - Sub-thought: Subtract sum of negative strengths from sum of positive strengths
- Sub-thought: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
  - Sub-thought: Subtract Low from High
- Sub-thought: Calculate Close-to-Open Return
  - Sub-thought: Compute (Close - Open) / Open
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Impact
  - Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of today's volume to the 20-day moving average of volume
  - Sub-thought: If ratio > 1.5, adjust Breakout Strength by multiplying by 1.5
- Sub-thought: Calculate Price Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close
- Sub-thought: Adjust Momentum by ATR
  - Sub-thought: Divide Price Momentum by ATR
- Sub-thought: Generate Alpha Factor
  - Sub-thought: Combine Indicators
    - Sub-thought: Sum Intraday High-Low Spread, Close-to-Open Return, Cumulated Breakout Strength, and ATR Adjusted Momentum
    - Sub-thought: Evaluate the result
      - Sub-thought: If result is positive, it indicates strong positive intraday and breakout momentum
      - Sub-thought: If result is negative, it shows the stock may be weakening
