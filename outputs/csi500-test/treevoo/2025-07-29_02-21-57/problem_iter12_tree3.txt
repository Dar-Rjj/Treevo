- Thought: Trend Strength Alpha Factor
  - Thought: Use the slope of a linear regression line fitted to the closing prices over the last T days as an indicator of trend strength.
- Thought: Liquidity-based Alpha Factor
  - Thought: Calculate the liquidity as the average of (volume / (high - low)) over the last U days.

  - Thought: Estimate the order imbalance using the difference between the number of up ticks and down ticks in the last V days, with a tick defined as any change in price.
- Thought: Market Sentiment Alpha Factor
  - Thought: Develop a sentiment score based on whether the stock closed higher or lower than its opening price over the last W days.
