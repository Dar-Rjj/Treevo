Synthesized High-Low Breakout with Intraday Momentum and Volume Impact
├── Calculate Daily Range
│   └── Subtract Low from High
├── Identify Breakouts
│   ├── If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
│   └── If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout
├── Calculate Breakout Strength
│   ├── For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / Daily Range
│   └── For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / Daily Range
├── Cumulate Breakout Strength
│   ├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 5 days
│   └── Sum all negative Breakout Strengths over the past 5 days
│       └── Subtract sum of negative strengths from sum of positive strengths
├── Calculate 10-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 10-Day Close Price Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price of day t-9
│   │   └── Use Close price of day t
│   ├── Calculate 10-Day Volume Ratio
│   │   ├── Sum volume from day t-9 to day t
│   │   └── Divide by Average 10-Day Volume
│   └── Multiply Close Price Return by Volume Ratio
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Calculate (High - Low) / Open
│   └── Compute 10-Day Moving Average of Intraday Volatility
└── Combine Indicators
    ├── Sum Cumulated Breakout Strength, 10-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum, and 10-Day Moving Average of Intraday Volatility
    └── Evaluate the result
        ├── If result is positive, it indicates strong positive intraday and breakout momentum
        └── If result is negative, it shows the stock may be weakening
