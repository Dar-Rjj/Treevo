Alpha Mining Thought Tree
- Fundamental Indicator Analysis
  - Price Movement Analysis
    - Calculate the percentage change from Close to Open price
  - Volatility Measure
    - Calculate True Range (max(High-Low, abs(High-Previous Close), abs(Low-Previous Close)))
      ├── Sum of True Ranges over a period for ATR (Average True Range) calculation
      │   └── Divide by 14
- Volume Analysis
  - Volume-Price Relationship
    - Calculate if Volume is increasing when prices are decreasing (Bearish Divergence)
    - Calculate if Volume is decreasing when prices are increasing (Bullish Divergence)
- Momentum Indicators
  - Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate Short-term SMA (e.g., 5-day SMA)
    - Calculate Long-term SMA (e.g., 20-day SMA)
    - Evaluate the crossover points as buy/sell signals
  - Price Oscillators
    - Calculate the difference or ratio between two different SMAs
    - Use the oscillator value to identify overbought/oversold conditions
- Advanced Alpha Concepts
  - Money Flow Index (MFI)
    - Calculate typical price (High + Low + Close) / 3
    - Positive and Negative Money Flow based on whether typical price is greater or less than the previous day
    - Ratio of positive to total money flow over a set period
- Market Sentiment
  - High vs. Low Position
    - Calculate the ratio of close to high price
    - Calculate the ratio of close to low price
- Breakout Analysis
  - Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's High and Low
    ├── If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
    └── If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout
  - Calculate Breakout Strength
    ├── For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
    └── For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
  - Cumulate Breakout Strength
    ├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
    └── Sum all negative Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
      └── Subtract sum of negative strengths from sum of positive strengths
- Intraday Metrics
  - Calculate Close-to-Open Return
    ├── Compute (Close - Open) / Open
- Volume Impact
  - Compute the ratio of today's volume to the 20-day moving average of volume
  - If ratio > 1.5, adjust Breakout Strength by multiplying by 1.5
- Price Momentum
  - Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close
- Weight by Volume
  - Multiply Volume by Momentum
- Adjust Momentum by ATR
  - Divide Weighted Momentum by ATR
- Generate Alpha Factor
  - Add ATR Adjusted Momentum to Close-to-Open Return
  - Combine Indicators
    ├── Sum Close-to-Open Return, Cumulated Breakout Strength, and ATR Adjusted Momentum
    └── Evaluate the result
        ├── If result is positive, it indicates strong positive intraday and breakout momentum
        └── If result is negative, it shows the stock may be weakening
