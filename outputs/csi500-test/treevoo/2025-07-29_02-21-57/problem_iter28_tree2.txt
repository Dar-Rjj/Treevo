Volume Weighted Moving Average, Momentum, and ATR Adjustments Crossover
├── Calculate Short-Term VWMA
│   ├── Daily Close Prices
│   └── Multiply Volume with Price
├── Calculate Long-Term VWMA
│   ├── Daily Close Prices
│   └── Multiply Volume with Price
├── Generate Crossover Signal
│   ├── If Short-Term VWMA > Long-Term VWMA, Buy Signal
│   └── If Short-Term VWMA < Long-Term VWMA, Sell Signal
├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── 5-Day Close Price Return
│   │   ├── Close price of day t-5
│   │   └── Close price of day t
│   └── Sum volume from day t-4 to day t
├── Evaluate Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── If positive, Buy Signal
│   └── If negative, Sell Signal
├── Combine Crossover and Momentum Signals
│   ├── If both Buy, strong Buy Signal
│   ├── If both Sell, strong Sell Signal
│   ├── If Crossover Buy and Momentum not, moderate Buy Signal
│   ├── If Crossover Sell and Momentum not, moderate Sell Signal
│   └── If no agreement, hold position
├── Calculate True Range
│   ├── High, Low, Previous Close prices
│   └── True Range: Max(High - Low, Abs(High - Previous Close), Abs(Low - Previous Close))
├── Calculate 14-Period ATR
│   ├── Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
│   └── Divide by 14
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close
├── Adjust Momentum by ATR
│   ├── Divide Price Momentum by ATR
├── Generate Alpha Factor
    ├── Add ATR Adjusted Momentum to Close-to-Open Return
    └── Combine with Crossover and Momentum Signal
        ├── If Alpha Factor is positive and combined signal is Buy, strong Buy
        ├── If Alpha Factor is negative and combined signal is Sell, strong Sell
        ├── If Alpha Factor is positive and combined signal is not Buy, moderate Buy
        ├── If Alpha Factor is negative and combined signal is not Sell, moderate Sell
        └── If no agreement, hold position
