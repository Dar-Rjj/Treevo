│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Range
│   └── Use Daily Ranges over the past 22 days
│       └── Compute the average
├── Identify Breakouts
│   ├── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's High
│   └── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's Low
│       ├── If Close is higher than Yesterday's High
│       │   └── Mark as an Upward Breakout
│       └── If Close is lower than Yesterday's Low
│           └── Mark as a Downward Breakout
├── Calculate Breakout Strength
│   ├── For Upward Breakouts
│   │   ├── Calculate the difference between Today's Close and Yesterday's High
│   │   └── Divide by 20-Day Average Daily Range
│   └── For Downward Breakouts
│       ├── Calculate the difference between Yesterday's Low and Today's Close
│       └── Divide by 20-Day Average Daily Range
├── Cumulate Breakout Strength
│   ├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
