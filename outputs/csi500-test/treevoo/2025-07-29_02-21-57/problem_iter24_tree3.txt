Alpha Mining Thought Tree
- Fundamental Indicator Analysis
  - Price Movement Analysis
    - Calculate the difference between Close and Open price (Day's Range)
    - Calculate the percentage change from Close to Open price
  - Volatility Measure
    - Calculate True Range (max(High-Low, abs(High-Previous Close), abs(Low-Previous Close)))
    - Sum of True Ranges over a period for ATR (Average True Range) calculation
- Volume Analysis
  - Volume Trend
    - Calculate the moving sum of Volume over a specific period
    - Calculate the rate of change in volume compared to the previous day
  - Volume-Price Relationship
    - Calculate if Volume is increasing when prices are decreasing (Bearish Divergence)
    - Calculate if Volume is decreasing when prices are increasing (Bullish Divergence)
- Momentum Indicators
  - Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate Short-term SMA (e.g., 5-day SMA)
    - Calculate Long-term SMA (e.g., 20-day SMA)
    - Evaluate the crossover points as buy/sell signals
  - Price Oscillators
    - Calculate the difference or ratio between two different SMAs
    - Use the oscillator value to identify overbought/oversold conditions
- Advanced Alpha Concepts
  - Money Flow Index (MFI)
    - Calculate typical price (High + Low + Close) / 3
    - Positive and Negative Money Flow based on whether typical price is greater or less than the previous day
    - Ratio of positive to total money flow over a set period
  - Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)
    - Calculate the multiplier: ((Close - Low) - (High - Close)) / (High - Low)
    - Add the multiplier times the volume for each period to get the A/D Line
- Pattern Recognition
  - Price Patterns
    - Identify basic patterns like Head and Shoulders, Double Tops, and Bottoms
    - Quantify the strength and duration of these patterns for potential reversal signals
  - Volume Patterns
    - Recognize patterns in volume such as spikes, flatness, or unusual changes relative to price movement
- Market Sentiment
  - High vs. Low Position
    - Calculate the ratio of close to high price
    - Calculate the ratio of close to low price
  - Opening Gap Analysis
    - Evaluate the gap between the previous day's close and the current day's open
    - Analyze the direction and magnitude of this gap
