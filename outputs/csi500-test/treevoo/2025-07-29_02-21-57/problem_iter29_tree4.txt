Calculate True Range and Daily Range
├── Get High, Low, and Previous Close prices
│   ├── Use High
│   ├── Use Low
│   └── Use Previous Close (if available, otherwise use Close)
├── Calculate TR1: High - Low
├── Calculate TR2: Abs(High - Previous Close)
├── Calculate TR3: Abs(Low - Previous Close)
├── True Range: Max(TR1, TR2, TR3)
└── Daily Range: High - Low

Calculate 14-Period Average True Range (ATR) and 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Range
├── Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
├── Divide by 14
├── Compute the average of Daily Ranges over the past 20 days

Identify Breakouts
├── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's High
└── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's Low
    ├── If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
    └── If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout

Calculate Breakout Strength
├── For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
└── For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range

Cumulate Breakout Strength
├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
└── Sum all negative Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
    └── Subtract sum of negative strengths from sum of positive strengths

Calculate Close-to-Open Return
├── Compute (Close - Open) / Open

Adjust Breakout Strength by Volume
├── Compute the ratio of today's volume to the 20-day moving average of volume
└── If ratio > 1.5, adjust Breakout Strength by multiplying by 1.5

Calculate Price Momentum
├── Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close

Weight by Volume
├── Multiply Volume by Momentum

Adjust Momentum by ATR
├── Divide Weighted Momentum by ATR

Generate Alpha Factor
├── Combine Indicators
    ├── Sum Cumulated Breakout Strength, Adjusted Breakout Strength, Close-to-Open Return, and ATR Adjusted Momentum
    └── Evaluate the result
        ├── If result is positive, it indicates strong positive intraday and breakout momentum
        └── If result is negative, it shows the stock may be weakening

Calculate Short-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
├── Daily Close Prices
└── Volume
    ├── Use Volume
    └── Multiply Volume with Price
    └── Sum of Volume * Price over the past 14 days
    └── Divide by Sum of Volume over the past 14 days

Calculate Long-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
├── Daily Close Prices
└── Volume
    ├── Use Volume
    └── Multiply Volume with Price
    └── Sum of Volume * Price over the past 20 days
    └── Divide by Sum of Volume over the past 20 days

Combined Crossover Signal
├── Compare Short-Term VWMA and Long-Term VWMA
│   ├── If Short-Term VWMA > Long-Term VWMA, generate Buy Signal
│   └── If Short-Term VWMA < Long-Term VWMA, generate Sell Signal

Calculate 5-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── Compute 5-Day Close Price Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t-5
│   └── Use Close price of day t
├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Ratio
│   ├── Sum volume from day t-4 to day t
│   └── Divide by Average 5-Day Volume
└── Multiply Close Price Return by Volume Ratio

Evaluate Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is positive, generate Buy Signal
└── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is negative, generate Sell Signal

Combine Crossover and Momentum Signals
├── If both VWMA Crossover and Volume Adjusted Momentum are Buy, strong Buy Signal
├── If both VWMA Crossover and Volume Adjusted Momentum are Sell, strong Sell Signal
├── If VWMA Crossover is Buy and Volume Adjusted Momentum is not, moderate Buy Signal
├── If VWMA Crossover is Sell and Volume Adjusted Momentum is not, moderate Sell Signal
└── If there is no agreement, hold position

Calculate High-Low Price Oscillation
├── Compute High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Use Low price of day t
├── Calculate 10-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range
│   ├── Collect High-L
