Thought: Integrated Breakout, Momentum, and Volume Analysis
- Sub-thought: Calculate Daily Range
  - Calculation: Daily_Range = High - Low
- Sub-thought: Calculate 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Range
  - Calculation: Avg_Daily_Range_20 = Sum(Daily_Range[i] for i in range(t-19, t+1)) / 20
- Sub-thought: Identify Breakouts
  - Calculation: If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward_Breakout
  - Calculation: If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward_Breakout
- Sub-thought: Calculate Breakout Strength
  - For Upward_Breakout: (Close - Yesterday's High) / Avg_Daily_Range_20
  - For Downward_Breakout: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / Avg_Daily_Range_20
- Sub-thought: Cumulate Breakout Strength
  - Sum positive Breakout_Strengths over the past 10 days
  - Sum negative Breakout_Strengths over the past 10 days
  - Final Strength = Sum(Positive) - Sum(Negative)
- Sub-thought: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
  - Calculation: Intraday_Spread = High - Low
- Sub-thought: Calculate Close-to-Open Return
  - Calculation: CTO_Return = (Close - Open) / Open
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Impact
  - Calculation: Volume_Ratio = Today's_Volume / 20-day_Avg_Volume
  - If Volume_Ratio > 1.5, Adjusted_Breakout_Strength = Breakout_Strength * 1.5
  - Otherwise, Adjusted_Breakout_Strength = Breakout_Strength
- Sub-thought: Combine Indicators
  - Total_Indicator = Intraday_Spread + CTO_Return + Final_Strength
  - Evaluation: If Total_Indicator is positive, strong positive momentum; if negative, weakening
- Sub-thought: Moving Averages
  - Calculation: SMA_10 = Sum(Close[i] for i in range(t-9, t+1)) / 10
  - Calculation: SMA_20 = Sum(Close[i] for i in range(t-19, t+1)) / 20
  - Calculation: EMA_10 = (Close[t] * (2 / (1 + 10))) + (EMA_10[t-1] * (1 - (2 / (1 + 10))))
  - Calculation: EMA_20 = (Close[t] * (2 / (1 + 20))) + (EMA_20[t-1] * (1 - (2 / (1 + 20))))
- Sub-thought: Volatility Analysis
  - Calculation: True_Range = Max(High[t], Close[t-1]) - Min(Low[t], Close[t-1])
  - Calculation: ATR_14 = Sum(True_Range[i] for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 14
- Sub-thought: New Highs or Lows
  - Calculation: If High[t] > Max(High[i] for i in range(t-5, t)), then New_High = True
  - Calculation: If Low[t] < Min(Low[i] for i in range(t-5, t)), then New_Low = True
- Sub-thought: Measure Momentum
  - Calculation: ROC_12 = (Close[t] - Close[t-12]) / Close[t-12]
  - Calculation: RSI_14 = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Average Gain / Average Loss)))
    - Where:
      - Average_Gain = Sum(Max(Close[i] - Close[i-1], 0) for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 14
      - Average_Loss = Abs(Sum(Min(Close[i] - Close[i-1], 0) for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 14)
- Sub-thought: Assess Volume Changes
  - Calculation: OBV[t] = OBV[t-1] + (Volume[t] if Close[t] > Close[t-1] else (-Volume[t] if Close[t] < Close[t-1] else 0))
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Trading Volume
  - Calculation: VWAP = Sum((High[i] + Low[i] + Close[i]) / 3 * Volume[i] for i in range(t-1, t+1)) / Sum(Volume[i] for i in range(t
