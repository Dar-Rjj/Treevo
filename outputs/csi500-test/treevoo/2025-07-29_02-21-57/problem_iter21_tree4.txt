Thought: Explore Enhanced Price and Volume Indicators
- Sub-thought: Calculate Advanced Moving Averages
  - Sub-sub-thought: Dual Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculation: SMA_50 = Sum(Close[i] for i in range(t-49, t+1)) / 50
    - Calculation: SMA_200 = Sum(Close[i] for i in range(t-199, t+1)) / 200
    - Calculation: EMA_50 = (Close[t] * (2 / (1 + 50))) + (EMA_50[t-1] * (1 - (2 / (1 + 50))))
    - Calculation: EMA_200 = (Close[t] * (2 / (1 + 200))) + (EMA_200[t-1] * (1 - (2 / (1 + 200))))
- Sub-thought: Analyze Detailed Volatility
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate True Range with High-Low Difference
    - Calculation: TR = Max(High[t], Close[t-1]) - Min(Low[t], Close[t-1])
    - Calculation: HL_TR = High[t] - Low[t]
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate Average True Range (ATR) with Weighted Average
    - Calculation: WATR_14 = (Sum(TR[i] * (i+1) for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 105)
- Sub-thought: Identify Breakouts and Gaps
  - Sub-sub-thought: New Highs or Lows with Gap Analysis
    - Calculation: If High[t] > Max(High[i] for i in range(t-5, t)), then New_High = True
    - Calculation: If Low[t] < Min(Low[i] for i in range(t-5, t)), then New_Low = True
    - Calculation: If Open[t] > Close[t-1] and High[t] > High[t-1], then Bullish_Gap = True
    - Calculation: If Open[t] < Close[t-1] and Low[t] < Low[t-1], then Bearish_Gap = True
- Sub-thought: Measure Momentum and Trend Strength
  - Sub-sub-thought: Rate of Change (ROC) of Close Prices with Longer Period
    - Calculation: ROC_24 = (Close[t] - Close[t-24]) / Close[t-24]
  - Sub-sub-thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI) with Different Period
    - Calculation: RSI_28 = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Average Gain / Average Loss)))
      - Where:
        - Average Gain = Sum(Max(Close[i] - Close[i-1], 0) for i in range(t-27, t+1)) / 28
        - Average Loss = Abs(Sum(Min(Close[i] - Close[i-1], 0) for i in range(t-27, t+1)) / 28)
- Sub-thought: Assess Volume Changes and Money Flow
  - Sub-sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV) with Volume Spike Detection
    - Calculation: OBV[t] = OBV[t-1] + (Volume[t] if Close[t] > Close[t-1] else (-Volume[t] if Close[t] < Close[t-1] else 0))
    - Calculation: Volume_Spike = (Volume[t] / Volume[t-1]) > 2
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) with Extended Period
    - Calculation: VWAP = Sum((High[i] + Low[i] + Close[i]) / 3 * Volume[i] for i in range(t-7, t+1)) / Sum(Volume[i] for i in range(t-7, t+1))
- Sub-thought: Examine Price and Volume Relationships with Additional Indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Money Flow Index (MFI) with Modified Calculation
    - Calculation: MFI_21 = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Positive Money Flow / Negative Money Flow)))
      - Where:
        - Positive Money Flow = Sum(Raw Money Flow[i] if Raw Money Flow[i] > 0 for i in range(t-20, t+1))
        - Negative Money Flow = Abs(Sum(Raw Money Flow[i] if Raw Money Flow[i] < 0 for i in range(t-20, t+1)))
        - Raw Money Flow = (High[i] + Low[i] + Close[i]) / 3 *
