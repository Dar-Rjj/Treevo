  - Calculation: SMA_10 = Sum(Close[i] for i in range(t-9, t+1)) / 10
  - Calculation: EMA_10 = (Close[t] * (2 / (1 + 10))) + (EMA_10[t-1] * (1 - (2 / (1 + 10))))
  - Calculation: TR = Max(High[t], Close[t-1]) - Min(Low[t], Close[t-1])
  - Calculation: ATR_14 = (Sum(TR[i] for i in range(t-13, t+1)) / 14)
  - Calculation: If High[t] > Max(High[i] for i in range(t-5, t)), then New_High = True
  - Calculation: If Low[t] < Min(Low[i] for i in range(t-5, t)), then New_Low = True
  - Calculation: ROC_12 = (Close[t] - Close[t-12]) / Close[t-12]
  - Calculation: RSI_14 = 100 - (
