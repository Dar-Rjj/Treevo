    ├── Use Volume
    └── Multiply Volume with Price

Combined Crossover Signal
├── Compare Short-Term VWMA and Long-Term VWMA
    ├── If Short-Term VWMA > Long-Term VWMA, generate Buy Signal
    └── If Short-Term VWMA < Long-Term VWMA, generate Sell Signal

Calculate 5-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── Compute 5-Day Close Price Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t-5
│   └── Use Close price of day t
└── Calculate 5-Day Volume Ratio
    ├── Sum volume from day t-4 to day t
    └── Divide by Average 5-Day Volume

Evaluate Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is positive, generate Buy Signal
└── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is negative, generate Sell Signal

Combine Crossover and Momentum Signals
├── If both VWMA Crossover and Volume Adjusted Momentum are Buy, strong Buy Signal
├── If both VWMA Crossover and Volume Adjusted Momentum are Sell, strong Sell Signal
├── If VWMA Crossover is Buy and Volume Adjusted Momentum is not, moderate Buy Signal
├── If VWMA Crossover is Sell and Volume Adjusted Momentum is not, moderate Sell Signal
└── If there is no agreement, hold position

Calculate True Range
├── Get High, Low, and Previous Close prices
│   ├── Use High
│   ├── Use Low
│   └── Use Previous Close (if available, otherwise use Close)
├── Calculate TR1: High - Low
├── Calculate TR2: Abs(High - Previous Close)
├── Calculate TR3: Abs(Low - Previous Close)
└── True Range: Max(TR1, TR2, TR3)

Calculate 14-Period Average True Range (ATR)
├── Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
└── Divide by 14

Calculate Price Momentum
├── Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close

Weight by Volume
├── Multiply Volume by Momentum

Adjust Momentum by ATR
├── Divide Weighted Momentum by ATR

Generate Alpha Factor
├── Add ATR Adjusted Momentum to Close-to-Open Return
├── Combine with Crossover and Momentum Signal
│   ├── If Alpha Factor is positive and combined signal is Buy, strong Buy
│   ├── If Alpha Factor is negative and combined signal is Sell, strong Sell
│   ├── If Alpha Factor is positive and combined signal is not Buy, moderate Buy
│   ├── If Alpha Factor is negative and combined signal is not Sell, moderate Sell
│   └── If there is no agreement, hold position
├── Integrate Volume-Price Correlation into Alpha Factor
│   ├── Calculate 20-Day Pearson Correlation Coefficient
│   │   ├── Use Close Prices
│   │   └── Use Volumes
│   ├── If Volume-Price Correlation is positive, boost Alpha Factor
│   └── If Volume-Price Correlation is negative, dampen Alpha Factor
├── Identify Breakouts
│   ├── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's High
│   └── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's Low
│       ├── If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
│       └── If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout
├── Calculate Breakout Strength
│   ├── For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
│   └── For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
├── Cumulate Breakout Strength
│   ├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
│   └── Sum all negative Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
│       └── Subtract sum of negative strengths from sum of positive strengths
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Compute (Close - Open) / Open
├── Calculate Volume Impact
│   ├── Compute the ratio of today's volume to the 20-day moving average of volume
│   └── If ratio > 1.5, adjust Breakout Strength by multiplying by 1.5
