Calculate True Range and Daily Range
├── Get High, Low, and Previous Close prices
│   ├── Use High
│   ├── Use Low
│   └── Use Previous Close (if available, otherwise use Close)
├── Calculate TR1: High - Low
├── Calculate TR2: Abs(High - Previous Close)
├── Calculate TR3: Abs(Low - Previous Close)
├── True Range: Max(TR1, TR2, TR3)
└── Daily Range: High - Low

Calculate 14-Period Average True Range (ATR) and 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Range
├── Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
├── Divide by 14
├── Compute the average of Daily Ranges over the past 20 days

Identify Breakouts
├── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's High
└── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's Low
    ├── If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
    └── If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout

Calculate Breakout Strength
├── For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
└── For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range

Cumulate Breakout Strength
├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
└── Sum all negative Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
    └── Subtract sum of negative strengths from sum of positive strengths

Calculate Price Momentum
├── Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close
└── Multiply by Volume

Adjust Momentum by ATR
├── Divide Weighted Momentum by ATR

Generate Alpha Factor
├── Add ATR Adjusted Momentum to Close-to-Open Return
├── Subtract Open from Close
├── Combine Indicators
│   ├── Sum Intraday High-Low Spread, Close-to-Open Return, Cumulated Breakout Strength, and ATR Adjusted Momentum
│   └── Evaluate the result
│       ├── If result is positive, it indicates strong positive intraday and breakout momentum
│       └── If result is negative, it shows the stock may be weakening
└── Incorporate Volume Trend
    ├── Calculate 10-Day Moving Average of Volume
    ├── Compare Today's Volume to 10-Day Moving Average of Volume
    │   ├── If Today's Volume > 10-Day MA, mark as Volume Surge
    │   └── If Today's Volume < 10-Day MA, mark as Volume Decline
    └── Adjust Alpha Factor
        ├── If Volume Surge, multiply Alpha Factor by 1.5
        └── If Volume Decline, multiply Alpha Factor by 0.5
