Synthesized High-Low Breakout with Intraday Momentum, Volume Impact, and Price Oscillation Adjustments
├── Calculate Daily Range
│   └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Range
│   └── Compute the average of Daily Ranges over the past 20 days
├── Identify Breakouts
│   ├── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's High
│   └── Compare Today's Close to Yesterday's Low
│       ├── If Close > Yesterday's High, mark as Upward Breakout
│       └── If Close < Yesterday's Low, mark as Downward Breakout
├── Calculate Breakout Strength
│   ├── For Upward Breakouts: (Close - Yesterday's High) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
│   └── For Downward Breakouts: (Yesterday's Low - Close) / 20-Day Avg Daily Range
├── Cumulate Breakout Strength
│   ├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
│   └── Sum all negative Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
│       └── Subtract sum of negative strengths from sum of positive strengths
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   └── Compute (Close - Open) / Open
├── Calculate Volume Weighted Price
│   └── Sum (Open * Volume, High * Volume, Low * Volume, Close * Volume)
├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-Day Close Price Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price of day t-5
│   │   └── Use Close price of day t
│   ├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Ratio
│   │   ├── Sum volume from day t-4 to day t
│   │   └── Divide by Average 5-Day Volume
│   └── Multiply Close Price Return by Volume Ratio
├── Calculate High-Low Price Oscillation
│   ├── Compute High-Low Range
│   │   ├── Use High price of day t
│   │   └── Use Low price of day t
│   ├── Calculate 10-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range
│   │   ├── Collect High-Low Ranges for 10 days
│   │   └── Compute Standard Deviation
│   └── Adjust Price Oscillation
│       ├── Subtract 10-Day Mean of High-Low Range
│       └── Divide by 10-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   ├── Use Open price of day t
│   └── Use Close price of day t
├── Compute Moving Averages
│   ├── Short-Term (e.g., 5 days) of Intraday Returns
│   └── Long-Term (e.g., 20 days) of Intraday Returns
├── Compute Intraday Return Difference
│   ├── Subtract Short-Term from Long-Term
├── Filter by Volume Change
│   ├── Compute Volume Change
│   │   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   │   └── Calculate difference between current and previous volume
│   └── Apply Condition
│       ├── If Volume Change is positive, use Intraday Return Difference
│       └── If Volume Change is negative, set to 0
└── Combine Indicators
    ├── Sum Intraday High-Low Spread, Close-to-Open Return, Volume Weighted Price, Cumulated Breakout Strength, 5-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum, and Adjusted Price Oscillation
    └── Evaluate the result
        ├── If result is positive, it indicates strong positive intraday and breakout momentum
        └── If result is negative, it shows the stock may be weakening
