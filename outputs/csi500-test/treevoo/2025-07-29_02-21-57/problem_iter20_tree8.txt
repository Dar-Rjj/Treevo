- Crossover Volume and Price Oscillation with ATR Adjusted Momentum and Historical Price Patterns
  - Calculate Short-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
    - Daily Close Prices
    - Volume Weighting
      - Use Volume
      - Multiply Volume with Price
  - Calculate Long-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
    - Daily Close Prices
    - Volume Weighting
      - Use Volume
      - Multiply Volume with Price
  - Calculate 5-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
    - Compute 5-Day Close Price Return
      - Use Close price of day t-5
      - Use Close price of day t
    - Calculate 5-Day Volume Ratio
      - Sum volume from day t-4 to day t
      - Divide by Average 5-Day Volume
  - Combined Crossover and Momentum Signal
    - Compare Short-Term VWMA and Long-Term VWMA
      - If Short-Term VWMA > Long-Term VWMA, generate Buy Signal
      - If Short-Term VWMA < Long-Term VWMA, generate Sell Signal
    - Evaluate Volume Adjusted Momentum
      - If Volume Adjusted Momentum is positive, generate Buy Signal
      - If Volume Adjusted Momentum is negative, generate Sell Signal
    - Combine Signals
      - If both VWMA Crossover and Volume Adjusted Momentum are Buy, strong Buy Signal
      - If both VWMA Crossover and Volume Adjusted Momentum are Sell, strong Sell Signal
      - If VWMA Crossover is Buy and Volume Adjusted Momentum is not, moderate Buy Signal
      - If VWMA Crossover is Sell and Volume Adjusted Momentum is not, moderate Sell Signal
      - If there is no agreement, hold position
  - Calculate True Range
    - Get High, Low, and Previous Close prices
      - Use High
      - Use Low
      - Use Previous Close (if available, otherwise use Close)
    - Calculate TR1: High - Low
    - Calculate TR2: Abs(High - Previous Close)
    - Calculate TR3: Abs(Low - Previous Close)
    - True Range: Max(TR1, TR2, TR3)
  - Calculate 14-Period Average True Range (ATR)
    - Sum of True Ranges over the last 14 periods
    - Divide by 14
  - Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
    - Subtract Low from High
  - Calculate Close-to-Open Return
    - Subtract Open from Close
  - Calculate Price Momentum
    - Subtract Close price 14 days ago from Current Close
  - Weight by Volume
    - Multiply Volume by Momentum
  - Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Multiply each price by its corresponding volume
      - For Open price
      - For High price
      - For Low price
      - For Close price
        - Sum the products
        - Sum the volumes
          - Divide the sum of products by the sum of volumes
  - Adjust Momentum by ATR
    - Divide Weighted Momentum by ATR
  - Explore historical price patterns
    - Calculate moving average of closing prices over different periods
      - Short-term (e.g., 5-day) moving average
      - Long-term (e.g., 100-day) moving average
    - Compute the difference between short-term and long-term moving averages
    - Calculate the rate of change (ROC) for close prices over various intervals
      - ROC over 14 days
  - Analyze the trend in high and low prices
    - Calculate the average true range (ATR) over a period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Examine volume and amount data
    - Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) to track buying and selling pressure
    - Compute the money flow index (MFI) using high, low, close, and volume
  - Identify volatility-based factors
    - Calculate standard deviation of daily returns over a period (e.g., 30 days)
    - Analyze the spread between high and low prices
      - Daily range (high - low)
  - Investigate momentum and acceleration
    - Calculate the relative strength index (RSI) to measure overbought/oversold levels
    - Compute the Chande momentum oscillator (CMO) to identify momentum changes
  - Incorporate technical indicators
    - Use the Bollinger Bands to assess volatility and potential breakout points
    - Apply the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to identify trends
  - Generate Alpha Factor
    - Add ATR Adjusted Momentum to VWAP
    - Include Intraday High-Low Spread
      - If Intraday High-Low Spread is high, increase Alpha Factor
      - If Intraday High-L
