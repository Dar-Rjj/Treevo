Calculate Long-Term Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
├── Daily Close Prices
└── Volume
    ├── Use Volume
    └── Multiply Volume with Price

Combined Crossover Signal
├── Compare Short-Term VWMA and Long-Term VWMA
│   ├── If Short-Term VWMA > Long-Term VWMA, generate Buy Signal
│   └── If Short-Term VWMA < Long-Term VWMA, generate Sell Signal

Calculate 5-Day Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── Compute 5-Day Close Price Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t-5
│   └── Use Close price of day t
├── Calculate 5-Day Volume Ratio
│   ├── Sum volume from day t-4 to day t
│   └── Divide by Average 5-Day Volume
└── Multiply Close Price Return by Volume Ratio

Evaluate Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is positive, generate Buy Signal
└── If Volume Adjusted Momentum is negative, generate Sell Signal

Combine Crossover and Momentum Signals
├── If both VWMA Crossover and Volume Adjusted Momentum are Buy, strong Buy Signal
├── If both VWMA Crossover and Volume Adjusted Momentum are Sell, strong Sell Signal
├── If VWMA Crossover is Buy and Volume Adjusted Momentum is not, moderate Buy Signal
├── If VWMA Crossover is Sell and Volume Adjusted Momentum is not, moderate Sell Signal
└── If there is no agreement, hold position

Calculate High-Low Price Oscillation
├── Compute High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Use Low price of day t
├── Calculate 10-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range
│   ├── Collect High-Low Ranges for 10 days
│   └── Compute Standard Deviation
└── Adjust Price Oscillation
    ├── Subtract 10-Day Mean of High-Low Range
    └── Divide by 10-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Range

Incorporate Price Oscillation
├── If Adjusted Price Oscillation is positive, generate Buy Signal
└── If Adjusted Price Oscillation is negative, generate Sell Signal

Generate Combined Signal
├── Combine Crossover, Momentum, and Price Oscillation Signals
│   ├── If VWMA, Momentum, and Price Oscillation are all Buy, Strong Buy
│   ├── If VWMA, Momentum, and Price Oscillation are all Sell, Strong Sell
│   ├── If VWMA and Momentum are Buy but Price Oscillation is not, Moderate Buy
│   ├── If VWMA and Momentum are Sell but Price Oscillation is not, Moderate Sell
│   ├── If VWMA is Buy and Momentum is not, but Price Oscillation is Buy, Moderate Buy
│   ├── If VWMA is Sell and Momentum is not, but Price Oscillation is Sell, Moderate Sell
│   └── If no agreement, Hold

Final Alpha Factor
├── If Strong Buy, return 1
├── If Strong Sell, return -1
├── If Moderate Buy, return 0.5
├── If Moderate Sell, return -0.5
└── If Hold, return 0

Calculate Intraday Return
├── Use Open price of day t
└── Use Close price of day t

Compute Moving Averages
├── Short-Term (e.g., 5 days) of Intraday Returns
└── Long-Term (e.g., 20 days) of Intraday Returns

Compute Intraday Return Difference
├── Subtract Short-Term from Long-Term

Filter by Volume Change
├── Compute Volume Change
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Calculate difference between current and previous volume
└── Apply Condition
    ├── If Volume Change is positive, use Intraday Return Difference
    └── If Volume Change is negative, set to 0

Incorporate Intraday Return Difference
├── If Intraday Return Difference is positive and Volume Change is positive, generate Buy Signal
└── If Intraday Return Difference is negative and Volume Change is positive, generate Sell Signal

Enhanced Combined Signal
├── Combine Crossover, Momentum, Price Oscillation, and Intraday Return Difference Signals
│   ├── If VWMA, Momentum, Price Oscillation, and Intraday Return Difference are all Buy, Strong Buy
│   ├── If VWMA, Momentum, Price Oscillation, and Intraday Return Difference are all Sell, Strong Sell
│   ├── If VWMA, Momentum, and Price Osc
