│       ├── If Close is higher than Yesterday's High
│       │   └── Mark as an Upward Breakout

│           └── Mark as a Downward Breakout
├── Calculate Breakout Strength
│   ├── For Upward Breakouts
│   │   ├── Calculate the difference between Today's Close and Yesterday's High
│   │   └── Divide by 20-Day Average Daily Range
│   └── For Downward Breakouts
│       ├── Calculate the difference between Yesterday's Low and Today's Close
│       └── Divide by 20-Day Average Daily Range
├── Cumulate Breakout Strength
│   ├── Sum all positive Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
│   └── Sum all negative Breakout Strengths over the past 10 days
│       └── Subtract the sum of negative strengths from the sum of positive strengths
