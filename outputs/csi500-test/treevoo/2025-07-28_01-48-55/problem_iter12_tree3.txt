Price Momentum, Volume Adjusted Spread, and Trend Strength with Weighted Moving Average
├── Calculate Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
│   ├── Use Close prices over a 15-day window
│   └── Compute WMA with exponentially increasing weights
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract WMA from Current Close price
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Spread
    ├── Calculate Spread
    │   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
    ├── Calculate Relative Volume
    │   ├── Divide Today's Volume by Average Volume over 30 days
    └── Multiply Spread by Relative Volume
├── Calculate Trend Strength
    ├── Calculate Absolute Difference between Close price of the current day and the previous day
    ├── Sum the Absolute Differences over a 5-day window
    └── Subtract the sum from the 5-day WMA
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Add Price Momentum
    ├── Subtract Volume Adjusted Spread
    ├── Subtract Trend Strength
    └── Output Final Alpha Factor
