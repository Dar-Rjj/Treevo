Thought: Explore Price-Based Alpha Factors
- Subthought: Calculate Momentum from Close Prices
  - Subthought: Compute the percentage change in close prices over a 10-day period
  - Subthought: Compute the percentage change in close prices over a 20-day period
  - Subthought: Subtract 20-day momentum from 10-day momentum to capture short-term reversal or continuation
- Subthought: Analyze High-Low Price Spread
  - Subthought: Calculate the daily range (high - low)
  - Subthought: Compute the average daily range over a 30-day window
  - Subthought: Determine if today's range is above or below the 30-day average range
- Subthought: Evaluate Open-Close Price Dynamics
  - Subthought: Determine if the close price is higher than the open price (indicating a positive day)
  - Subthought: Count the number of positive days over the last 5 trading days
  - Subthought: Calculate the ratio of positive days to total days in the 5-day window
- Subthought: Assess Volume and Price Correlation
  - Subthought: Compute the daily volume-weighted average price (VWAP) as (open + high + low + close) / 4 * volume
  - Subthought: Calculate the correlation between VWAP and volume over the past 10 trading days
  - Subthought: If the correlation is positive, it suggests that higher volumes are associated with higher prices
- Subthought: Investigate Amount and Volume Trends
  - Subthought: Calculate the daily amount (close * volume)
  - Subthought: Compute the 10-day moving average of the daily amount
  - Subthought: Compare today's amount with the 10-day moving average
  - Subthought: If today's amount is significantly higher, it may indicate increased buying pressure
