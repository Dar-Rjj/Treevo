Thought: Calculate the relationship between closing price and other prices, and integrate volume and amount for generating alpha factors
- Sub-thought: Explore the relationship between closing price and open, high, low prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the difference between today's close and today's open, then sum it over a period to find trend
  - Sub-sub-thought: Identify the ratio of today's close to today's high, then track its change over time
  - Sub-sub-thought: Analyze the gap from today's close to today's low, and consider its average over a defined window
- Sub-thought: Investigate the impact of volume on price movements
  - Sub-sub-thought: Relate changes in closing price with percentage change in volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Measure the correlation between daily returns and volume to identify significant patterns
- Sub-thought: Examine the role of amount traded in the stock's price dynamics
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compare the current day’s amount traded with the previous day’s to assess market interest
  - Sub-sub-thought: Establish a factor based on the moving average of the amount traded relative to the closing price
- Sub-thought: Integrate multiple price and volume indicators to create composite alpha factors
  - Sub-sub-thought: Combine the difference between today's close and open with the percentage change in volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create a composite factor using the ratio of today's close to high and the correlation between returns and volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Develop a factor that incorporates the gap from today's close to low and the moving average of the amount traded
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the interplay between different factors
  - Sub-sub-thought: Analyze the combined effect of the closing price difference and the volume percentage change
  - Sub-sub-thought: Investigate the interaction between the close-to-high ratio and the return-volume correlation
  - Sub-sub-thought: Examine the joint impact of the close-to-low gap and the amount traded moving average
