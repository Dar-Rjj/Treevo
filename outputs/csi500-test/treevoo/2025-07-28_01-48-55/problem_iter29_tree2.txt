Thought: Synthesize alpha factors from price and volume dynamics to predict future returns
  Thought: Analyze closing price momentum
    Thought: Calculate daily return as (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
      Thought: Compute the 5-day moving average of daily returns to capture short-term momentum
      Thought: Compute the 20-day moving average of daily returns to identify medium-term trend
  Thought: Examine intraday price dynamics
    Thought: Determine the intraday range as (high_t - low_t)
      Thought: Calculate the ratio of intraday range to previous day's close, i.e., (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
    Thought: Measure the upper and lower shadow lengths as (high_t - max(open_t, close_t)) and (min(open_t, close_t) - low_t)
      Thought: Evaluate the ratio of upper shadow length to lower shadow length to indicate potential market sentiment
  Thought: Investigate volume for trading interest
    Thought: Assess the change in volume from the previous day, i.e., volume_t - volume_t-1
      Thought: Categorize days based on whether there is an increase or decrease in volume
    Thought: Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume to detect unusual trading activity
  Thought: Integrate price and volume indicators
    Thought: Create a composite factor by combining the 20-day momentum of daily returns with the 20-day moving average volume ratio
      Thought: Assign weights to each component based on their individual predictive power
  Thought: Explore additional price-volume relationships
    Thought: Analyze the relationship between daily returns and volume
      Thought: Calculate the correlation between 5-day moving average of daily returns and 5-day moving average of volume
      Thought: Calculate the correlation between 20-day moving average of daily returns and 20-day moving average of volume
    Thought: Develop a combined price-volume factor
      Thought: Create a composite factor by combining the 20-day momentum of daily returns, the 20-day moving average volume ratio, and the correlations
        Thought: Assign weights to each component based on their individual and combined predictive power
