- Begin by exploring the relationships between (open, high, low, close) prices, amount, and volume to generate alpha factors.
  - Calculate simple price movements
    - Daily return: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
    - Intraday return: (High_t - Low_t) / Open_t
  - Examine trading activity
    - Volume change: Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}
    - Amount change: Amount_t - Amount_{t-1}
  - Analyze price patterns
    - Price range: High_t - Low_t
    - Price-to-open ratio: (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t
  - Investigate momentum
    - Moving average difference: (SMA(Close, n)_t - SMA(Close, n)_{t-1}) / SMA(Close, n)_{t-1} where n is a window size
    - Relative strength: (Close_t - Close_{t-n}) / Close_{t-n}
  - Incorporate volatility
    - Volatility: Standard deviation of returns over a window
  - Consider volume-weighted indicators
    - Volume-weighted average price (VWAP): Sum(Close_i * Volume_i) / Sum(Volume_i) over a period
    - Volume-adjusted return: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) * Volume_t / Volume_{t-1}
  - Explore trend-following strategies
    - Moving average crossover: Sign(SMA(Close, n)_t - SMA(Close, m)_t) where n < m
    - Exponential moving average (EMA) slope: (EMA(Close, n)_t - EMA(Close, n)_{t-1}) / EMA(Close, n)_{t-1}
  - Combine multiple factors
    - Composite factor: Weighted sum of daily return, intraday return, and momentum
    - Factor combination: (Daily return + Intraday return + Momentum) / 3
  - Evaluate factor performance
    - Factor correlation with future returns
    - Backtest factor on historical data
    - Refine and iterate on factor design
