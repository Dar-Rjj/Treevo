Thought: Explore price and volume patterns for novel alpha factors
- Thought: Analyze daily return patterns
  - Thought: Calculate simple moving average (SMA) of daily returns over different periods
    - Sub-thought: SMA(5), SMA(10), SMA(20)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between long-term and short-term SMAs
      - Sub-sub-thought: SMA(20) - SMA(5)
      - Sub-sub-thought: Use this as a momentum indicator
- Thought: Examine volatility using high, low, and close prices
  - Thought: Calculate the True Range (TR) for each day
    - Sub-thought: TR = max(high(t)-low(t), abs(high(t)-close(t-1)), abs(low(t)-close(t-1)))
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) over different periods
      - Sub-sub-thought: ATR(5), ATR(14)
- Thought: Investigate volume-related indicators
  - Thought: Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Sub-thought: OBV(t) = OBV(t-1) + (close(t) > close(t-1) ? volume(t) : -volume(t))
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the rate of change of OBV over different periods
      - Sub-sub-thought: ROC(OBV, 5), ROC(OBV, 10)
- Thought: Combine multiple indicators for a composite factor
  - Thought: Create a composite score by summing up scaled versions of the above factors
    - Sub-thought: Composite = w1 * (SMA(20) - SMA(5)) + w2 * ATR(14) + w3 * ROC(OBV, 10)
    - Sub-thought: Determine weights (w1, w2, w3) through historical backtesting
