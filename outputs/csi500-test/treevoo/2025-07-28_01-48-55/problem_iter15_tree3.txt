            Sub-Thought: Calculate 20-Day SMA for Close Price
            Sub-Thought: Cross Over Factor
                - Define: Signal when 5-Day SMA crosses above 20-Day SMA
        Sub-Thought: Momentum
            Sub-Thought: Calculate 10-Day Rate of Change (ROC) for Close Price
            Sub-Thought: Calculate 30-Day ROC for Close Price
            Sub-Thought: Momentum Factor
                - Define: Difference between 10-Day ROC and 30-Day ROC
    Sub-Thought: Volume Analysis
        Sub-Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
            - Define: Cumulative sum of volume on up days minus volume on down days
            Sub-Thought: OBV Slope
                - Define: 10-Day Linear Regression Slope of OBV
        Sub-Thought: Volume Trend
            - Define: 5-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Volume
            - Define: 20-Day EMA of Volume
            Sub-Thought: Volume Trend Factor
                - Define: When 5-Day EMA of Volume is above 20-Day EMA of Volume
    Sub-Thought: Range Analysis
        Sub-Thought: True Range
            - Define: Max(High - Low, Abs(High - Previous Close), Abs(Low - Previous Close))
            Sub-Thought: Average True Range (ATR)
                - Define: 14-Day EMA of True Range
            Sub-Thought: Range Volatility Factor
                - Define: Current ATR divided by 50-Day ATR
    Sub-Thought: Pattern Recognition
        Sub-Thought: Engulfing Pattern
            - Define: Bullish Engulfing occurs when a small bearish candle is followed by a large bullish candle that engulfs the previous candle's body
            - Define: Bearish Engulfing occurs when a small bullish candle is followed by a large bearish candle that engulfs the previous candle's body
            Sub-Thought: Engulfing Pattern Factor
                - Define: +1 for Bullish Engulfing, -1 for Bearish Engulfing, 0 otherwise
        Sub-Thought: Doji Pattern
            - Define: A Doji pattern where Open and Close are almost the same
            Sub-Thought: Doji Pattern Factor
                - Define: +1 for Doji, 0 otherwise
    Sub-Thought: Integration of Alpha Factors
        Sub-Thought: Combine Factors into a Composite Score
            - Define: Weights for each factor based on their historical performance
            - Define: Composite Score as the weighted sum of all individual factors
        Sub-Thought: Generate Trade Signals
            - Define: Long Signal if Composite Score > Threshold
            - Define: Short Signal if Composite Score < -Threshold
            - Define: No Trade Signal if -Threshold <= Composite Score <= Threshold
