    - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between the current day's close and the previous day's close
    - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between the current day's high and the previous day's low
  - Sub-thought: Identify consecutive days with increasing or decreasing prices
    - Sub-thought: Count the number of consecutive days where the close is higher than the previous day's close
    - Sub-thought: Count the number of consecutive days where the close is lower than the previous day's close
  - Sub-thought: Measure volatility
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the range (high - low) for each day
    - Sub-thought: Compute the average range over a specified lookback period
  - Sub-thought: Analyze volume patterns
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of the current day's volume to the previous day's volume
    - Sub-thought: Determine if the current day's volume is significantly higher or lower than the average volume over a specified lookback period
Thought: Examine Trading Volume and Amount
  - Sub-thought: Analyze volume and amount correlation
    - Sub-thought: Compute the correlation between the daily volume and the daily amount over a specified lookback period
  - Sub-thought: Identify significant trading days
    - Sub-thought: Flag days where the volume is more than a threshold (e.g., 2x the average volume)
    - Sub-thought: Flag days where the amount is more than a threshold (e.g., 2x the average amount)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate trading intensity
    - Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of the daily amount to the daily volume
    - Sub-thought: Determine the trend in trading intensity over a specified lookback period
Thought: Investigate Opening and Closing Gaps
  - Sub-thought: Measure opening gaps
    - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between the current day's open and the previous day's close
    - Sub-thought: Determine the frequency of positive and negative gaps over a specified lookback period
  - Sub-thought: Measure closing gaps
    - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between the next day's open and the current day's close
    - Sub-thought: Determine the frequency of positive and negative gaps over a specified lookback period
  - Sub-thought: Analyze gap direction and size
    - Sub-thought: Categorize gaps as large, medium, or small based on their size
    - Sub-thought: Determine if the gap direction (positive or negative) is consistent with the overall price trend
Thought: Evaluate Momentum and Reversal Signals
  - Sub-thought: Calculate short-term momentum
    - Sub-thought: Compute the average return over a specified lookback period (e.g., 5 days)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate long-term momentum
    - Sub-thought: Compute the average return over a longer lookback period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Sub-thought: Identify reversal signals
    - Sub-thought: Detect days where the current day's close is below the moving average of the close over a specified lookback period
    - Sub-thought: Detect days where the current day's close is above the moving average of the close over a specified lookback period
  - Sub-thought: Compute the relative strength
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of the current day's close to the lowest close over a specified lookback period
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of the current day's close to the highest close over a specified lookback period
