Thought: Begin with fundamental price actions
- Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over a 10-day period to understand recent average price levels.
- Sub-thought: Introduce momentum by calculating the difference between today's close and the SMA as a measure of current direction.
-- Sub-thought: Use the 5-day rate of change (ROC) on the close price to gauge short-term momentum strength, branching into:
--- Sub-thought: If 5-day ROC is positive, consider there's a potential for continuation of the trend.
--- Sub-thought: If negative, it may signal a reversal or a slowdown in the upward movement.
- Sub-thought: Incorporate volatility as a factor by calculating the Average True Range (ATR) over the past 14 days to measure market volatility.
- Sub-thought: Explore trading volume patterns
-- Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the last 20 days to identify unusual volume changes that could indicate significant market activity or potential turning points.
-- Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between volume and price change to identify days with high volume but little price movement, possibly signaling a change in sentiment.
- Sub-thought: Investigate the interaction between high and low prices to assess intraday price action
-- Sub-thought: Compute the daily price range (High - Low), and its average over the last 30 days, then compare today’s range to this average to identify days with higher-than-usual price movements.
-- Sub-thought: Consider the ratio of (Close - Open) to the daily price range to quantify the position of the close relative to the day's trading range, potentially indicating bullish or bearish closes.
- Sub-thought: Examine the role of open and close prices in relation to the overall price action
-- Sub-thought: Assess the number of up days (days where Close > Open) versus down days (where Close < Open) over the past month, to get a sense of the prevailing market bias.
-- Sub-thought: Evaluate the gap between the opening price and the previous day's close to detect overnight sentiment shifts.
- Sub-thought: Incorporate aspects of financial flows by analyzing the amount traded at different price levels
-- Sub-thought: Calculate the total value traded at each price level within the day, and analyze if more value is concentrated near the high or low, suggesting where major buying or selling pressure lies.
-- Sub-thought: Determine the cumulative value traded above and below the midpoint of the day (Midpoint = (High + Low) / 2) to provide insight into whether the bulk of trades occurred at relatively higher or lower prices during the day.
