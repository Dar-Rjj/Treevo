Improved Intraday Reversal and Price Momentum with Volume Trends
├── Calculate Adjusted Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Subtract Median of Close prices from day t-1 to t-20
│   └── Multiply by Average Volume over 20 Days
│       ├── Sum Volume from day t-19 to day t
│       └── Divide by 20
│   └── Divide by Current Volume (day t)
├── Calculate Intraday Reversal
│   ├── Use High and Low Prices
│   │   └── Calculate the difference: High - Low
│   └── Adjust for Opening Range
│       ├── Use Open and Close Prices
│       └── Subtract: (High - Low) - (Open - Close)
├── Measure Daily Volume Change
│   ├── Compare Today's Volume with Yesterday's Volume
│   └── Compute: (Today’s Volume / Yesterday’s Volume) - 1
├── Calculate Volume Moving Average
│   ├── Choose a Time Window (e.g., 5 days)
│   └── Compute the Moving Average of Volume over the selected window
└── Combine Adjusted Momentum, Intraday Reversal, and Volume Changes
    ├── Multiply Adjusted Price Momentum by a constant factor (e.g., 1.5)
    └── Multiply Intraday Reversal by Daily Volume Change
    │   └── Divide by Volume Moving Average
    │       └── Use the Volume Moving Average value
    └── Add the two results to get the final factor value
