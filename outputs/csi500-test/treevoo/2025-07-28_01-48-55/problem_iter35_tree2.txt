Thought: Integrated Alpha Factor Generation Using Price, Volume, and Momentum Indicators
├── Develop Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume Indicators
│   ├── Create a Simple Moving Average (SMA) Factor
│   │   └── Calculate the 5-day SMA of the closing prices as a factor
│   ├── Explore Momentum-Based Indicators
│   │   └── Generate a Momentum Factor using the close price
│   │       └── Define the Momentum Factor as the difference between the current day's close and the close 5 days ago
│   ├── Leverage Volume for Insight
│   │   └── Create a Volume Change Indicator
│   │       └── Calculate the percentage change in volume from one day to the next
│   ├── Utilize Range Information
│   │   └── Incorporate the Range (High - Low) into an Alpha Factor
│   │       └── Compute the average daily range over the past 5 days
│   ├── Combine Multiple Elements for Complexity
│   │   └── Build a Composite Factor Combining Price, Volume, and Range
│   │       └── Define the composite factor as (Momentum / Average 5-Day Range) * Volume Change
│   ├── Evaluate Order Imbalance
│   │   └── Construct an Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) Factor
│   │       └── Use the difference between the number of transactions at the bid and ask prices to measure order imbalance
│   ├── Investigate High-Low Patterns
│   │   └── Formulate a High-Low Breakout Factor
│   │       └── Identify days where the high is significantly higher than the average high and the low is significantly lower than the average low over the last 5 days
│   ├── Analyze Trading Activity
│   │   └── Create a Transaction Count Indicator
│   │       └── Calculate the total number of transactions per day
│   ├── Examine Price Gaps
│   │   └── Develop a Price Gap Factor
│   │       └── Measure the difference between the current day's open and the previous day's close
│   ├── Incorporate Financial Ratios
│   │   └── Construct a Volume-Weighted Price Factor
│   │       └── Calculate the weighted average price using volume as the weight
│   ├── Assess Market Sentiment
│   │   └── Formulate a Sentiment Indicator
│   │       └── Use the ratio of the number of upward movements to the number of downward movements in the stock price
│   ├── Examine Daily Returns
│   │   └── Generate a Daily Return Factor
│   │       └── Calculate the percentage change in the closing price from one day to the next
│   ├── Explore Intraday Volatility
│   │   └── Create an Intraday Volatility Factor
│   │       └── Compute the standard deviation of the intraday price changes over the past 5 days
│   └── Investigate Accumulation/Distribution
│       └── Construct an Accumulation/Distribution Line
│           └── Calculate the sum of the product of the daily close and the daily volume
├── Synthesis of Price Momentum, Volume Adjusted Factors, and Fundamental Price Actions
│   ├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│   │   ├── Use Close prices over a 10-day window for both EMA and SMA
│   │   │   └── Compute EMA with smoothing factor of 2/(N+1)
│   │   │   └── Compute SMA
│   ├── Calculate Price Momentum and Momentum Strength
│   │   ├── Subtract EMA from Current Close price
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Rate of Change (ROC) on the Close price
│   │       ├── If 5-day ROC is positive, potential trend continuation
│   │       └── If negative, potential trend reversal or slowdown
│   ├── Calculate Volume Adjusted High-Low Range and Trading Volume Patterns
│   │   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
│   │   ├── Compute the daily price range (High - Low), and its average over the last 30 days
│   │   └── Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the last 20 days
│   │       └── Multiply Range by Square Root of Logarithm of Volume
│   ├── Calculate Enhanced Momentum Factor
│   │   ├── Use Adjusted High-Low Range
│   │   └── Use Rolling Window
│   │       ├── Set Window Size to 7
│   │       └── Compute Weighted Sum with exponentially increasing weights
