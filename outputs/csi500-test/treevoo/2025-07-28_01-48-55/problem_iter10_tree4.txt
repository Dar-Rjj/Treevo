Price Momentum and Volume Adjusted Spread with Weighted Moving Average
├── Calculate Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
│   ├── Use Close prices over a 10-day window
│   └── Compute WMA with linearly increasing weights
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract WMA from Current Close price
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Spread
    ├── Calculate Spread
    │   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
    ├── Calculate Relative Volume
    │   ├── Divide Today's Volume by Average Volume over 20 days
    └── Multiply Spread by Relative Volume
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Add Price Momentum
    ├── Subtract Volume Adjusted Spread
    └── Output Final Alpha Factor
