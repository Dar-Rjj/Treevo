Thought: Synthesis of Price Momentum, Volume Adjusted Factors, and Fundamental Price Actions
├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│   ├── Use Close prices over a 10-day window for both EMA and SMA
│   │   └── Compute EMA with smoothing factor of 2/(N+1)
│   │   └── Compute SMA
├── Calculate Price Momentum and Momentum Strength
│   ├── Subtract EMA from Current Close price
│   └── Calculate 5-day Rate of Change (ROC) on the Close price
│       ├── If 5-day ROC is positive, consider there's a potential for continuation of the trend
│       └── If negative, it may signal a reversal or a slowdown in the upward movement
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted High-Low Range and Trading Volume Patterns
│   ├── Use High and Low prices
│   │   └── Subtract Low price from High price
│   │   └── Compute the daily price range (High - Low), and its average over the last 30 days
│   └── Use Volume
│       └── Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the last 20 days
│       └── Multiply Range by Square Root of Logarithm of Volume
├── Calculate Enhanced Momentum Factor
│   ├── Use Adjusted High-Low Range
│   └── Use Rolling Window
│       ├── Set Window Size to 7
│       └── Compute Weighted Sum with weights exponentially increasing
├── Analyze Daily Price Action and Volatility
│   ├── Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) over the past 14 days
│   └── Compare today’s range to the average range over the last 30 days
│       ├── If today's range is higher than the average, identify days with higher-than-usual price movements
│       └── Consider the ratio of (Close - Open) to the daily price range to quantify the position of the close relative to the day's trading range
├── Evaluate Market Sentiment
│   ├── Assess the number of up days (days where Close > Open) versus down days (where Close < Open) over the past month
│   └── Determine the gap between the opening price and the previous day's close to detect overnight sentiment shifts
├── Investigate Financial Flows
│   ├── Calculate the total value traded at each price level within the day
│   │   └── Analyze if more value is concentrated near the high or low, suggesting where major buying or selling pressure lies
│   └── Determine the cumulative value traded above and below the midpoint of the day (Midpoint = (High + Low) / 2)
│       └── Provide insight into whether the bulk of trades occurred at relatively higher or lower prices during the day
├── Trend Indicator
│   ├── Use Close prices
│   ├── Compare 50-day SMA to Current Close price
│   │   ├── If 50-day SMA > Current Close, assign -1
│   │   └── If 50-day SMA <= Current Close, assign 1
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Add Price Momentum
    ├── Subtract Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
    ├── Add Enhanced Momentum Factor
    ├── Multiply by Trend Indicator
    └── Output Final Alpha Factor
