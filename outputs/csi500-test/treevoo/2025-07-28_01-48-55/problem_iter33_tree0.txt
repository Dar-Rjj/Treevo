Performing alpha mining to generate novel and interpretable factors for predicting future stock returns
  Utilize basic price and volume data (open, high, low, close, amount, volume) on or before day t
    Calculate moving averages of close prices over varying time windows (5, 10, 20, 30 days) for trend analysis
      Evaluate the slope of these moving average lines as an indicator of the strength and direction of the current trend
    Develop a price momentum indicator by comparing the current close price with its value n days ago
      Implement this for multiple lookback periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50 days) to capture different momentum dynamics
    Measure volatility using the standard deviation of log returns over the past n days
      Experiment with different n values (e.g., 10, 20, 30 days) to find the most predictive period
    Create a relative strength index (RSI) based factor, not normalized, but adjusted to use custom thresholds (e.g., below 30 and above 70 are the usual oversold/overbought levels)
      Adjust RSI calculation parameters (look-back period, method for calculating average gains/losses) for enhanced signal generation
    Formulate a volume-to-price correlation factor to identify if the changes in price are supported by trading volume
      Examine this relationship over various durations (e.g., last 5, 10, 20 days) to detect significant patterns
    Construct a factor that combines price action (e.g., gaps) and candlestick characteristics (like doji, hammer, engulfing patterns) without normalization
      Focus on specific candlestick formations that often indicate market turning points
    Investigate the influence of gap openings between two consecutive days' closing and opening prices
      Analyze the size and direction of gaps over a series of time periods to infer potential breakaway or continuation moves
