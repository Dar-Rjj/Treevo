Thought: Synthesize Alpha Factors from Price Patterns and Volume Dynamics
  Thought: Analyze Closing Price Momentum
    Thought: Calculate daily return as (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
      Thought: Compute the 5-day moving average of daily returns to capture short-term momentum
      Thought: Compute the 20-day moving average of daily returns to identify medium-term trend
    Thought: Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over a 15-day window
      Thought: Use Close prices with smoothing factor of 2/(N+1)
  Thought: Examine Intraday Price Dynamics
    Thought: Determine the intraday range as (high_t - low_t)
      Thought: Calculate the ratio of intraday range to previous day's close, i.e., (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
      Thought: Compute the High-Low Price Range
        Thought: Subtract Low price from High price
      Thought: Integrate with Integrated Momentum
        Thought: Multiply High-Low Range by Integrated Momentum
    Thought: Measure the upper and lower shadow lengths as (high_t - max(open_t, close_t)) and (min(open_t, close_t) - low_t)
      Thought: Evaluate the ratio of upper shadow length to lower shadow length to indicate potential market sentiment
  Thought: Investigate Volume for Trading Interest
    Thought: Assess the change in volume from the previous day, i.e., volume_t - volume_t-1
      Thought: Categorize days based on whether there is an increase or decrease in volume
      Thought: Calculate Volume Change
        Thought: Use Volume of day t
        Thought: Use Volume of day t-1
    Thought: Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume to detect unusual trading activity
      Thought: Calculate Relative Volume
        Thought: Use Today's Volume
        Thought: Use Average Volume over 20 days
        Thought: Divide Today's Volume by Average Volume
  Thought: Integrate Price and Volume Indicators
    Thought: Create a composite factor by combining the 20-day momentum of daily returns with the 20-day moving average volume ratio
      Thought: Assign weights to each component based on their individual predictive power
    Thought: Calculate Price Momentum
      Thought: Subtract EMA from Current Close price
    Thought: Integrate Log Return with Volume Change
      Thought: Multiply Daily Log Return by Square Root of Volume Change
      Thought: Accumulate the Product over 14 days
  Thought: Enhance with Moving Average Crossover
    Thought: Calculate 7-day Exponential Moving Average
      Thought: Use Close price
    Thought: Calculate 28-day Exponential Moving Average
      Thought: Use Close price
    Thought: Determine Crossover Signal
      Thought: If 7-day EMA > 28-day EMA, add a positive value to Integrated Momentum
      Thought: If 7-day EMA < 28-day EMA, subtract a positive value from Integrated Momentum
      Thought: No change if 7-day EMA = 28-day EMA
  Thought: Incorporate Enhanced Volume Thrust
    Thought: Use Open price of day t
    Thought: Use High price of day t
    Thought: Use Low price of day t
    Thought: Use Close price of day t
    Thought: Use Volume of day t
    Thought: Compute Upward Thrust
      Thought: If (Close > Open), add (Volume * (Close - Open)) to Upward Thrust
    Thought: Compute Downward Thrust
      Thought: If (Close <= Open), add (Volume * (Open - Close)) to Downward Thrust
    Thought: Combine Factors
      Thought: Subtract Downward Thrust from Upward Thrust
      Thought: Add (High - Low) / Close to the result
  Thought: Final Integration
    Thought: Add Integrated Momentum to Intraday Momentum
    Thought: Add the result to the Enhanced Volume Thrust
    Thought: Subtract Rolling Average of Daily Log Return from Rolling Average of Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
    Thought: Add the Enhanced Crossover Signal
  Thought: Final Alpha Factor
    Thought: Add Price Momentum
    Thought: Subtract Volume Adjusted Spread
    Thought: Add Enhanced Momentum Factor
    Thought: Output Final Alpha Factor
