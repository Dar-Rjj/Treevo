Crossover Between Intraday Reversal, Volume Momentum, and Enhanced Momentum Composite with Basic Price and Volume Data
├── Intraday Reversal
│   └── Subtract: (High - Low) - (Open - Close)
├── Volume Momentum
│   └── Subtract: Today’s Volume - Yesterday’s Volume
├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
│   ├── Use Close prices over a 10-day window
│   └── Compute EMA with smoothing factor of 2/(N+1)
├── High-Low Price Range
│   └── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
│   └── Multiply High-Low Range by Square Root of Logarithm of Volume
├── Composite Factor
│   └── Add: (Intraday Reversal * Volume Momentum) + (Today’s Close - Yesterday’s Close)
├── Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract EMA from Current Close price
├── Volume Adjusted Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price to get Spread
│   ├── Divide Today's Volume by Average Volume over 20 days for Relative Volume
│   └── Multiply Spread by Square Root of Relative Volume
├── Enhanced Momentum Factor
│   ├── Use Adjusted High-Low Range
│   └── Compute Weighted Sum with weights linearly increasing over 5-day rolling window
├── Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
│   ├── Compute the SMA of closing prices over 5, 10, and 20 days
├── Relative Strength Index (RSI)
│   └── Calculate RSI based on the change in closing prices
├── Volume Shock Factor
│   └── Identify large deviations from the mean volume over a certain period
├── Volume Trend Factor
│   └── Capture the direction and stability of volume trends
├── Daily Price Range and Volatility Trends
│   ├── Construct a daily price range by subtracting the day's low from the high
│   └── Calculate its moving average to identify trends in volatility
├── Breakout Indicator
│   └── Define if the current high or low is significantly beyond recent highs or lows
├── Open-Close Ratio
│   └── Generate an open-close ratio that indicates whether the stock tends to open higher or lower than it closes
├── Bullish/Bearish Candlestick Factor
│   └── Count the number of days with green (up) or red (down) candles over a specific period
├── Liquidity Measure
│   └── Design a liquidity measure that looks at the total amount traded, signaling changes in market depth
├── Amount-Weighted Price Movement
│   └── Create an amount-weighted price movement by summing the product of the change in price and the amount, divided by total amount
├── Regime-Specific Factors
│   └── Identify factors that only become active under certain market conditions, such as high volatility or trending markets
├── Intraday Reversal Pattern
│   └── Calculate the difference between the first and last half of the day's trading session
├── Opening Gap Impact
│   └── Measure the distance between the previous day's close and the current day's open
└── Final Alpha Factor
