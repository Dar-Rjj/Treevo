Synthesized Intraday Reversal and Price Momentum with Volume Trend
├── Calculate Adjusted Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Subtract Mean of Close prices from day t-1 to t-20
│   └── Multiply by Average Volume over 20 Days
│       ├── Sum Volume from day t-19 to day t
│       └── Divide by 20
│   └── Divide by Current Volume (day t)
├── Calculate Intraday Reversal
│   ├── Use High and Low Prices
│   │   └── Calculate the difference: High - Low
│   └── Adjust for Opening Range
│       ├── Use Open and Close Prices
│       └── Subtract: (High - Low) - (Open - Close)
├── Measure Volume Change
│   └── Compute: Today’s Volume - Yesterday’s Volume
└── Combine Adjusted Momentum, Intraday Reversal, and Volume Change
    ├── Multiply Adjusted Price Momentum by a constant factor (e.g., 1)
    └── Multiply Intraday Reversal by Volume Change
    │   └── Divide by Moving Average of Volume
    │       └── Use a 5-day Moving Average of Volume
    └── Add the two results to get the final factor value
