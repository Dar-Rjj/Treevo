    Thought: Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) using Close prices over a 10-day window
      Thought: Compute EMA with smoothing factor of 2/(N+1)
    Thought: Calculate Weighted Moving Average (WMA) using Close prices over a 15-day window
      Thought: Compute WMA with exponentially increasing weights
    Thought: Integrate EMAs into momentum calculations
      Thought: Subtract EMA from Current Close price to get Price Momentum
      Thought: Subtract WMA from Current Close price to get Integrated Momentum
        Thought: Add the 20-day moving average of daily returns to Integrated Momentum
  Thought: Investigate intraday price dynamics and volatility
    Thought: Determine the intraday range as (high_t - low_t)
      Thought: Calculate the ratio of intraday range to previous day's close, i.e., (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
    Thought: Measure the upper and lower shadow lengths as (high_t - max(open_t, close_t)) and (min(open_t, close_t) - low_t)
      Thought: Evaluate the ratio of upper shadow length to lower shadow length to indicate potential market sentiment
    Thought: Calculate Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
      Thought: Multiply (high_t - low_t) by the Square Root of Logarithm of Volume
    Thought: Calculate 10-day Historical Volatility using Close prices
      Thought: Incorporate 10-day Historical Volatility with Enhanced Volume Thrust
  Thought: Examine volume and its interaction with price
    Thought: Assess the change in volume from the previous day, i.e., volume_t - volume_t-1
      Thought: Categorize days based on whether there is an increase or decrease in volume
    Thought: Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume to detect unusual trading activity
    Thought: Integrate log return with volume change
      Thought: Calculate Daily Log Return using Close price of day t and t-1
      Thought: Accumulate the Product of Daily Log Return and Volume Change over 10 days
    Thought: Calculate Enhanced Volume Thrust
      Thought: If (Close > Open), Add (Volume * (Close - Open)) to Upward Thrust
      Thought: If (Close <= Open), Add (Volume * (Open - Close)) to Downward Thrust
      Thought: Combine Factors
        Thought: Subtract Downward Thrust from Upward Thrust
        Thought: Add (High - Low) / Open to the result
  Thought: Enhance with moving average crossover signals
    Thought: Calculate 5-day and 20-day Exponential Moving Averages
      Thought: Determine Crossover Signal
        Thought: If 5-day EMA > 20-day EMA, Add a positive value to Integrated Momentum
        Thought: If 5-day EMA < 20-day EMA, Subtract a positive value from Integrated Momentum
        Thought: No change if 5-day EMA = 20-day EMA
