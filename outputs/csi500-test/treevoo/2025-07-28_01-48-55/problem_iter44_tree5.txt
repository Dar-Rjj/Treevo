Thought: Synthesize and Enhance Price, Volume, and Momentum Factors for Predicting Stock Returns
  Thought: Analyze Closing Price Momentum with Enhanced Moving Averages
    Thought: Calculate Daily Return as (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
      Thought: Compute the 5-day moving average of daily returns to capture short-term momentum
      Thought: Compute the 20-day moving average of daily returns to identify medium-term trend
    Thought: Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) using Close prices over a 10-day window
      Thought: Subtract EMA from Current Close price to get Price Momentum
    Thought: Calculate Weighted Moving Average (WMA) using Close prices over a 15-day window
      Thought: Subtract WMA from Current Close price to get Integrated Momentum
        Thought: Add the 20-day moving average of daily returns to Integrated Momentum
  Thought: Investigate Intraday Price Dynamics and Volatility
    Thought: Determine the intraday range as (high_t - low_t)
      Thought: Calculate the ratio of intraday range to previous day's close, i.e., (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
    Thought: Measure the upper and lower shadow lengths as (high_t - max(open_t, close_t)) and (min(open_t, close_t) - low_t)
      Thought: Evaluate the ratio of upper shadow length to lower shadow length to indicate potential market sentiment
    Thought: Calculate 10-day Historical Volatility using Close prices
  Thought: Examine Volume and Its Interaction with Price
    Thought: Assess the change in volume from the previous day, i.e., volume_t - volume_t-1
    Thought: Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume to detect unusual trading activity
    Thought: Integrate log return with volume change
      Thought: Calculate Daily Log Return using Close price of day t and t-1
      Thought: Accumulate the Product of Daily Log Return and Volume Change over 10 days
    Thought: Calculate Enhanced Volume Thrust
      Thought: If (Close > Open), Add (Volume * (Close - Open)) to Upward Thrust
      Thought: If (Close <= Open), Add (Volume * (Open - Close)) to Downward Thrust
      Thought: Combine Factors
        Thought: Subtract Downward Thrust from Upward Thrust
  Thought: Incorporate more complex patterns or relationships between days
    Thought: Look at the trend of returns over multiple days
      Thought: Sum the daily returns over the past 5 days
        Thought: This can be used as a momentum indicator
    Thought: Consider how the current day's performance compares to the recent average
      Thought: Calculate the average of the past 5 days' close prices
        Thought: Create a factor by subtracting this average from the current close
          Thought: This highlights the deviation from the recent mean
    Thought: Examine the consistency of the closing price with respect to its historical values
      Thought: Calculate the standard deviation of the close prices over the past 20 days
        Thought: Create a z-score factor for the current close price
          Thought: This indicates how far the current close is from the mean in terms of standard deviations
  Thought: Develop a composite factor that combines multiple aspects of the above thought branches
    Thought: Aggregate different individual factors into a single score
      Thought: Weight each factor based on its perceived importance
        Thought: Sum the weighted factors to form the final alpha factor
  Thought: Enhance with Moving Average Crossover Signals
    Thought: Calculate 5-day and 20-day Exponential Moving Averages
      Thought: Determine Crossover Signal
        Thought: If 5-day EMA > 20-day EMA, Add a positive value to Integrated Momentum
        Thought: If 5-day EMA < 20-day EMA, Subtract a positive value from Integrated Momentum
  Thought: Construct Final Composite Alpha Factor
    Thought: Add Price Momentum
    Thought: Add Integrated Momentum
    Thought: Subtract Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
    Thought: Subtract Volume Adjusted Spread
    Thought: Add Integrated Log Return
    Thought: Add Enhanced Crossover Signal
    Thought: Add the Enhanced Volume Thrust
    Thought: Multiply 10-day Historical Volatility by Enhanced Volume Thrust
    Thought: Apply a 20-day rolling window to calculate the average of Daily Log Return
    Thought: Subtract the Rolling Average of Daily Log Return from the final alpha factor
    Thought: Output Final Alpha Factor
