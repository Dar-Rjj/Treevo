- Thought: Analyze Closing Price Momentum with Enhanced Moving Averages
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Return as (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the 5-day moving average of daily returns to capture short-term momentum
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the 20-day moving average of daily returns to identify medium-term trend
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) using Close prices over a 10-day window
    - Sub-Thought: Compute EMA with smoothing factor of 2/(N+1)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Weighted Moving Average (WMA) using Close prices over a 15-day window
    - Sub-Thought: Compute WMA with linearly increasing weights
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate EMAs into momentum calculations
    - Sub-Thought: Subtract EMA from Current Close price to get Price Momentum
    - Sub-Thought: Subtract WMA from Current Close price to get Integrated Momentum
      - Sub-Thought: Add the 20-day moving average of daily returns to Integrated Momentum
- Thought: Investigate Intraday Price Dynamics and Volatility
  - Sub-Thought: Determine the intraday range as (high_t - low_t)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of intraday range to previous day's close, i.e., (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
  - Sub-Thought: Measure the upper and lower shadow lengths as (high_t - max(open_t, close_t)) and (min(open_t, close_t) - low_t)
    - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the ratio of upper shadow length to lower shadow length to indicate potential market sentiment
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
    - Sub-Thought: Multiply (high_t - low_t) by the Square Root of Logarithm of Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate 10-day Historical Volatility using Close prices
    - Sub-Thought: Incorporate 10-day Historical Volatility with Enhanced Volume Thrust
- Thought: Examine Volume and Its Interaction with Price
  - Sub-Thought: Assess the change in volume from the previous day, i.e., volume_t - volume_t-1
    - Sub-Thought: Categorize days based on whether there is an increase or decrease in volume
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume to detect unusual trading activity
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate log return with volume change
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Log Return using Close price of day t and t-1
    - Sub-Thought: Accumulate the Product of Daily Log Return and Volume Change over 10 days
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Enhanced Volume Thrust
    - Sub-Thought: If (Close > Open), Add (Volume * (Close - Open)) to Upward Thrust
    - Sub-Thought: If (Close <= Open), Add (Volume * (Open - Close)) to Downward Thrust
    - Sub-Thought: Combine Factors
      - Sub-Thought: Subtract Downward Thrust from Upward Thrust
      - Sub-Thought: Add (High - Low) / Open to the result
- Thought: Enhance with Moving Average Crossover Signals
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate 5-day and 20-day Exponential Moving Averages
    - Sub-Thought: Determine Crossover Signal
      - Sub-Thought: If 5-day EMA > 20-day EMA, Add a positive value to Integrated Momentum
      - Sub-Thought: If 5-day EMA < 20-day EMA, Subtract a positive value from Integrated Momentum
      - Sub-Thought: No change if 5-day EMA = 20-day EMA
