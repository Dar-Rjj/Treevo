Price and Intraday Momentum with Volume and Amount Adjustment
├── Calculate Price and Intraday Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   ├── Subtract Close price of day t-20
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   ├── Use Low price of day t
│   └── Compute (High - Low) / Low and add to price momentum
└── Adjust Momentum by Average Volume and Amount
    ├── Calculate Average Volume over 20 Days
    │   ├── Sum Volume from day t-19 to day t
    │   └── Divide by 20
    ├── Calculate Average Amount over 20 Days
    │   ├── Sum Amount from day t-19 to day t
    │   └── Divide by 20
    └── Adjust Momentum
        ├── Multiply Price and Intraday Momentum by Average Volume
        ├── Multiply the Result by Average Amount
        └── Divide by (Current Volume * Current Amount)
