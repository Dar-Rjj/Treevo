│   └── Subtract 20-day momentum from 10-day momentum to capture short-term reversal or continuation
├── Analyze High-Low Price Spread
│   ├── Calculate the daily range (high - low)
│   ├── Compute the average daily range over a 30-day window
│   └── Determine if today's range is above or below the 30-day average range

│   └── Calculate the ratio of positive days to total days in the 5-day window
├── Assess Volume and Price Correlation
│   ├── Compute the daily volume-weighted average price (VWAP) as (open + high + low + close) / 4 * volume
│   ├── Calculate the correlation between VWAP and volume over the past 10 trading days
│   └── If the correlation is positive, it suggests that higher volumes are associated with higher prices
