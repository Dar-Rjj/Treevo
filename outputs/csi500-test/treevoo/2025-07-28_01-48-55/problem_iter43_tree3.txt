- Calculate price changes and trends
  - Compute daily return (close[t] / close[t-1] - 1)
  - Compute intraday return (close[t] / open[t] - 1)
  - Compute high-low range (high[t] - low[t])
  - Determine trend direction (close[t] > close[t-1])
- Analyze volume and liquidity
  - Compute volume change (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
  - Identify volume spikes (if volume[t] > 2 * volume[t-1])
- Examine market sentiment
  - Compute relative strength (close[t] - low[t]) / (high[t] - low[t])
  - Determine positive or negative sentiment (close[t] > open[t])
- Combine multiple signals
  - Create a composite score by summing up the following:
    - Weighted daily return
    - Weighted intraday return
    - High-low range
    - Trend direction
    - Volume change
    - Relative strength
    - Market sentiment
- Evaluate momentum
  - Compute short-term moving average (SMA) of daily returns over 5 days
  - Compute long-term moving average (LMA) of daily returns over 20 days
  - Determine momentum (SMA > LMA)
- Analyze volatility
  - Compute daily volatility (standard deviation of daily returns over 20 days)
  - Determine high or low volatility (daily volatility > historical threshold)
- Assess trading activity
  - Compute average true range (ATR) over 14 days
  - Determine increased or decreased volatility (ATR > ATR[t-1])
- Final alpha factor
  - Combine all the above signals into a single alpha factor
  - Assign weights to each signal based on their predictive power
  - Sum up the weighted signals to get the final alpha factor
