- Begin by exploring the relationships between (open, high, low, close) prices, amount, and volume to generate alpha factors.
  - Calculate simple price movements
    - Daily return: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
      - Compute the 5-day moving average of daily returns to capture short-term momentum
      - Compute the 20-day moving average of daily returns to identify medium-term trend
    - Intraday return: (High_t - Low_t) / Open_t
  - Examine trading activity
    - Volume change: Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}
    - Amount change: Amount_t - Amount_{t-1}
  - Analyze price patterns
    - Price range: High_t - Low_t
    - Price-to-open ratio: (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t
  - Investigate momentum
    - Moving average difference: (SMA(Close, n)_t - SMA(Close, n)_{t-1}) / SMA(Close, n)_{t-1} where n is a window size
    - Relative strength: (Close_t - Close_{t-n}) / Close_{t-n}
    - Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) using Close prices over a 10-day window
      - Subtract EMA from Current Close price to get Price Momentum
    - Calculate Weighted Moving Average (WMA) using Close prices over a 15-day window
      - Subtract WMA from Current Close price to get Integrated Momentum
        - Add the 20-day moving average of daily returns to Integrated Momentum
  - Incorporate volatility
    - Volatility: Standard deviation of returns over a window
    - Calculate 10-day Historical Volatility using Close prices
  - Consider volume-weighted indicators
    - Volume-weighted average price (VWAP): Sum(Close_i * Volume_i) / Sum(Volume_i) over a period
    - Volume-adjusted return: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) * Volume_t / Volume_{t-1}
    - Assess the change in volume from the previous day, i.e., volume_t - volume_t-1
    - Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume to detect unusual trading activity
    - Integrate log return with volume change
      - Calculate Daily Log Return using Close price of day t and t-1
      - Accumulate the Product of Daily Log Return and Volume Change over 10 days
    - Calculate Enhanced Volume Thrust
      - If (Close > Open), Add (Volume * (Close - Open)) to Upward Thrust
      - If (Close <= Open), Add (Volume * (Open - Close)) to Downward Thrust
      - Combine Factors
        - Subtract Downward Thrust from Upward Thrust
  - Explore trend-following strategies
    - Moving average crossover: Sign(SMA(Close, n)_t - SMA(Close, m)_t) where n < m
    - Exponential moving average (EMA) slope: (EMA(Close, n)_t - EMA(Close, n)_{t-1}) / EMA(Close, n)_{t-1}
    - Calculate 5-day and 20-day Exponential Moving Averages
      - Determine Crossover Signal
        - If 5-day EMA > 20-day EMA, Add a positive value to Integrated Momentum
        - If 5-day EMA < 20-day EMA, Subtract a positive value from Integrated Momentum
  - Combine multiple factors
    - Composite factor: Weighted sum of daily return, intraday return, and momentum
    - Factor combination: (Daily return + Intraday return + Momentum) / 3
  - Construct Final Composite Alpha Factor
    - Add Price Momentum
    - Add Integrated Momentum
    - Subtract Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
    - Subtract Volume Adjusted Spread
    - Add Integrated Log Return
    - Add Enhanced Crossover Signal
    - Add the Enhanced Volume Thrust
    - Multiply 10-day Historical Volatility by Enhanced Volume Thrust
    - Apply a 20-day rolling window to calculate the average of Daily Log Return
    - Subtract the Rolling Average of Daily Log Return from the final alpha factor
    - Output Final Alpha Factor
  - Evaluate factor performance
    - Factor correlation with future returns
    - Backtest factor on historical data
    - Refine and iterate on factor design
