Thought: Synthesize Alpha Factors from Price, Volume, and Momentum for Predicting Future Returns
  Thought: Analyze Closing Price Momentum with Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
    Thought: Calculate daily return as (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
      Thought: Compute the 20-day moving average of daily returns to identify medium-term trend
    Thought: Use Close prices over a 10-day window
      Thought: Compute WMA with weights linearly increasing
    Thought: Subtract WMA from Current Close price
      Thought: Output Price Momentum
  Thought: Examine Intraday Price Dynamics
    Thought: Determine the intraday range as (high_t - low_t)
      Thought: Calculate the ratio of intraday range to previous day's close, i.e., (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
    Thought: Measure the upper and lower shadow lengths as (high_t - max(open_t, close_t)) and (min(open_t, close_t) - low_t)
      Thought: Evaluate the ratio of upper shadow length to lower shadow length to indicate potential market sentiment
  Thought: Investigate Volume for Trading Interest
    Thought: Assess the change in volume from the previous day, i.e., volume_t - volume_t-1
    Thought: Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume to detect unusual trading activity
  Thought: Integrate Price and Volume Indicators
    Thought: Create a composite factor by combining the 20-day momentum of daily returns with the 20-day moving average volume ratio
      Thought: Assign weights to each component based on their individual predictive power
    Thought: Develop a combined price-volume factor
      Thought: Combine the 20-day momentum of daily returns, the 20-day moving average volume ratio, and the correlations
        Thought: Assign weights to each component based on their individual and combined predictive power
  Thought: Explore Additional Price-Volume Relationships
    Thought: Calculate High-Low Price Range
      Thought: Subtract Low price from High price
    Thought: Calculate Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
      Thought: Multiply Range by Logarithm of Volume
    Thought: Calculate Relative Volume
      Thought: Divide Today's Volume by Average Volume over 20 days
    Thought: Multiply Spread by Relative Volume
      Thought: Output Volume Adjusted Spread
  Thought: Final Alpha Factor
    Thought: Add Price Momentum
    Thought: Subtract Volume Adjusted Spread
    Thought: Output Final Alpha Factor
