Improved Intraday Reversal and Price Momentum with Volume Trends
├── Calculate Adjusted Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Subtract Median of Close prices from day t-1 to t-20
│   └── Multiply by Average Volume over 20 Days
│       └── Sum Volume from day t-19 to day t and divide by 20
│   └── Divide by Current Volume (day t)
├── Calculate Intraday Reversal
│   ├── Use High and Low Prices: High - Low
│   └── Adjust for Opening Range: (High - Low) - (Open - Close)
├── Measure Daily Volume Change
│   └── Compute: (Today’s Volume / Yesterday’s Volume) - 1
├── Combine Adjusted Momentum, Intraday Reversal, and Volume Changes
    ├── Multiply Adjusted Price Momentum by a constant factor (e.g., 1.5)
    └── Multiply Intraday Reversal by Daily Volume Change
    └── Add the two results to get the final factor value
