Thought: Develop a novel alpha factor based on the relationship between volume and price changes.
    Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price from day t-1 to day t.
        Sub-thought: If the percentage change is positive, assign a value of 1; if negative, assign a value of -1.
            Sub-thought: Multiply the assigned value by the volume at day t to create a price-volume indicator.
                Sub-thought: Calculate a moving average of the price-volume indicator over the past N days (e.g., N=10) to smooth out short-term noise.
                    Sub-thought: Subtract the long-term moving average (e.g., M=30) of the price-volume indicator from the short-term moving average (N=10) to capture trend changes.
                        Sub-thought: Use the result as the final alpha factor, where a positive value suggests a bullish signal and a negative value suggests a bearish signal.
