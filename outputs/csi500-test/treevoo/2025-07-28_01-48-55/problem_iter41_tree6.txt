Thought: Synthesize Price, Momentum, Volume, and Volatility Factors for Enhanced Alpha Mining
├── Calculate Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) and Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│   ├── Use Close prices over a 10-day window for both EMA and SMA
│   │   └── Compute EMA with smoothing factor of 2/(N+1)
│   │   └── Compute SMA
├── Analyze Price Momentum and Integrated Momentum
│   ├── Subtract 10-day EMA from Current Close price to get Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract 15-day Weighted Moving Average (WMA) from Current Close price to get Integrated Momentum
│   ├── Add the 20-day moving average of daily returns to Integrated Momentum
│   └── Compute 5-day Rate of Change (ROC) on the Close price
│       ├── If 5-day ROC is positive, potential trend continuation
│       └── If negative, potential trend reversal or slowdown
├── Investigate Intraday Price Dynamics and Volatility
│   ├── Determine the intraday range as (high_t - low_t)
│   ├── Calculate the ratio of intraday range to previous day's close, i.e., (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
│   ├── Measure the upper and lower shadow lengths as (high_t - max(open_t, close_t)) and (min(open_t, close_t) - low_t)
│   │   └── Evaluate the ratio of upper shadow length to lower shadow length to indicate potential market sentiment
│   ├── Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) over the past 14 days
│   └── Compare today’s range to the average range over the last 30 days
│       ├── If today's range is higher than the average, identify days with higher-than-usual price movements
│       └── Consider the ratio of (Close - Open) to the daily price range to quantify the position of the close relative to the day's trading range
├── Volume Adjusted High-Low Range and Trading Volume Patterns
│   ├── Multiply (high_t - low_t) by the Square Root of Logarithm of Volume
│   ├── Calculate the 10-day Historical Volatility using Close prices
│   ├── Incorporate 10-day Historical Volatility with Enhanced Volume Thrust
│   ├── Assess the change in volume from the previous day, i.e., volume_t - volume_t-1
│   │   └── Categorize days based on whether there is an increase or decrease in volume
│   ├── Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume to detect unusual trading activity
│   ├── Integrate log return with volume change
│   │   ├── Calculate Daily Log Return using Close price of day t and t-1
│   │   └── Accumulate the Product of Daily Log Return and Volume Change over 10 days
│   ├── Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
│   │   ├── Initialize OBV to zero
│   │   ├── If Close > Previous Close, add today's volume to OBV
│   │   ├── If Close < Previous Close, subtract today's volume from OBV
│   │   └── If Close == Previous Close, do not change OBV
│   ├── Calculate Enhanced Volume Thrust
│   │   ├── If (Close > Open), Add (Volume * (Close - Open)) to Upward Thrust
│   │   ├── If (Close <= Open), Add (Volume * (Open - Close)) to Downward Thrust
│   │   └── Subtract Downward Thrust from Upward Thrust
│   │   └── Add (High - Low) / Open to the result
├── Moving Average Crossover Signals
│   ├── Calculate 5-day and 20-day EMAs
│   │   ├── Determine Crossover Signal
│   │   │   ├── If 5-day EMA > 20-day EMA, Add a positive value to Integrated Momentum
│   │   │   ├── If 5-day EMA < 20-day EMA, Subtract a positive value from Integrated Momentum
│   │   │   └── No change if 5-day EMA = 20-day EMA
├── Trend Indicator
│   ├── Use Close prices
│   ├── Compare 50-day SMA to Current Close price
│   │   ├── If 50-day SMA > Current Close, assign -1
│   │   └── If 50-day SMA <= Current Close, assign 1
├── Incorporate Price Volatility and RSI
│   ├── Calculate the standard deviation of the Close price over the past 30 days
│   ├── Use the standard
