Price Momentum and Volume Adjusted Factors Synthesis with Weighted Moving Average
├── Calculate Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
│   ├── Use Close prices over a 10-day window
│   └── Compute WMA with weights linearly increasing
├── Calculate High-Low Price Range
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Price Range by Logarithm of Volume
└── Calculate Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Subtract WMA from Current Close price
    ├── Add Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
    └── Output Final Alpha Factor
