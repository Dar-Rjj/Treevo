  Thought: Investigate Intraday Price Dynamics and Volatility
    Thought: Determine the intraday range as (high_t - low_t)
      Thought: Calculate the ratio of intraday range to previous day's close, i.e., (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
    Thought: Measure the upper and lower shadow lengths as (high_t - max(open_t, close_t)) and (min(open_t, close_t) - low_t)

    Thought: Calculate 10-day Historical Volatility using Close prices
      Thought: Incorporate 10-day Historical Volatility with Enhanced Volume Thrust
  Thought: Examine Volume and Its Interaction with Price
    Thought: Assess the change in volume from the previous day, i.e., volume_t - volume_t-1
    Thought: Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume to detect unusual trading activity
    Thought: Integrate log return with volume change
      Thought: Calculate Daily Log Return using Close price of day t and t-1
      Thought: Accumulate the Product of Daily Log Return and Volume Change over 10 days
    Thought: Calculate Enhanced Volume Thrust
      Thought: If (Close > Open), Add (Volume * (Close - Open)) to Upward Thrust
      Thought: If (Close <= Open), Add (Volume * (Open - Close)) to Downward Thrust
      Thought: Combine Factors
        Thought: Subtract Downward Thrust from Upward Thrust
        Thought: Add (High - Low) / Open to the result
