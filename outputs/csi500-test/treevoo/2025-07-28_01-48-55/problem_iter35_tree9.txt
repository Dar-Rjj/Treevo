Thought: Synthesize alpha factors from price and volume dynamics to predict future returns
  Thought: Analyze closing price momentum
    Thought: Calculate daily return as (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
      Thought: Compute the 20-day moving average of daily returns to identify medium-term trend
  Thought: Examine intraday price dynamics
    Thought: Determine the intraday range as (high_t - low_t)
      Thought: Calculate the ratio of intraday range to previous day's close, i.e., (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
    Thought: Measure the upper and lower shadow lengths as (high_t - max(open_t, close_t)) and (min(open_t, close_t) - low_t)
      Thought: Evaluate the ratio of upper shadow length to lower shadow length to indicate potential market sentiment
  Thought: Investigate volume for trading interest
    Thought: Assess the change in volume from the previous day, i.e., volume_t - volume_t-1
      Thought: Categorize days based on whether there is an increase or decrease in volume
    Thought: Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume to detect unusual trading activity
  Thought: Intraday Reversal: (High - Low) - (Open - Close)
  Thought: Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
    Thought: Use Close prices over a 10-day window
    Thought: Compute WMA with weights linearly increasing
  Thought: Volume Momentum: Today’s Volume - Yesterday’s Volume
  Thought: High-Low Range: High - Low
  Thought: Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
    Thought: Use High-Low Range
    Thought: Use Volume
      Thought: Multiply Range by Square Root of Logarithm of Volume
  Thought: Price Momentum
    Thought: Subtract WMA from Current Close price
  Thought: Volume Adjusted Spread
    Thought: Calculate Spread: High - Low
    Thought: Calculate Relative Volume: Today's Volume / 20-day Average Volume
    Thought: Multiply Spread by Square Root of Relative Volume
  Thought: Composite Factor
    Thought: Add: (Intraday Reversal * Volume Momentum) + (Today’s Close - Yesterday’s Close)
  Thought: Momentum Factor
    Thought: Use Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
    Thought: Sum over a Rolling Window
  Thought: Enhanced Momentum
    Thought: Use Price Momentum
    Thought: Use Momentum Factor
  Thought: Integrate price and volume indicators
    Thought: Create a composite factor by combining the 20-day momentum of daily returns with the 20-day moving average volume ratio
      Thought: Assign weights to each component based on their individual predictive power
  Thought: Explore additional price-volume relationships
    Thought: Analyze the relationship between daily returns and volume
      Thought: Calculate the correlation between 20-day moving average of daily returns and 20-day moving average of volume
    Thought: Develop a combined price-volume factor
      Thought: Create a composite factor by combining the 20-day momentum of daily returns, the 20-day moving average volume ratio, and the correlations
        Thought: Assign weights to each component based on their individual and combined predictive power
  Thought: Final Alpha Factor
    Thought: Add Composite Factor
    Thought: Add Enhanced Momentum
    Thought: Subtract Volume Adjusted Spread
