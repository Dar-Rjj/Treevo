- Calculate price change momentum
  - Compute the difference between close prices of consecutive days to measure short-term momentum
  - Use the 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day difference as separate factors
- Measure volatility
  - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a rolling window (e.g., 20 days)
  - Use different rolling windows (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days) to capture various volatility scales
- Explore trading volume trends
  - Calculate the percentage change in daily volume compared to the previous day
  - Use the 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day percentage change as separate factors
- Identify breakout patterns
  - Detect if the current day's high is higher than the highest high of the past n days
  - Detect if the current day's low is lower than the lowest low of the past n days
  - Use different lookback periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days) for sensitivity
- Analyze price-to-volume relationships
  - Calculate the ratio of the absolute price change to the daily volume
  - Use this ratio to identify significant price movements with high or low volume
- Evaluate market sentiment from candlestick patterns
  - Create a factor based on whether the day's open and close prices form a bullish or bearish pattern
  - Assign +1 for bullish (close > open), -1 for bearish (close < open), and 0 for no change
- Assess liquidity
  - Calculate the average daily volume over a rolling window (e.g., 20 days)
  - Use the rolling average volume to gauge liquidity
- Consider price gaps
  - Detect if there is a gap between the previous day's close and the current day's open
  - Assign +1 for a positive gap (open > prev_close), -1 for a negative gap (open < prev_close), and 0 for no gap
