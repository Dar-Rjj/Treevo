Thought 1: Start with basic price data analysis
    Thought 2: Calculate daily return
        Thought 3: Use close prices to calculate the daily return (close[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1]
    Thought 4: Analyze volume and amount
        Thought 5: Calculate the daily turnover rate (volume[t] / volume[t-1])
        Thought 6: Calculate the daily amount change (amount[t] - amount[t-1])
    Thought 7: Incorporate high and low prices
        Thought 8: Calculate the daily range (high[t] - low[t])
        Thought 9: Calculate the daily range percentage (range[t] / close[t-1])
    Thought 10: Combine multiple factors
        Thought 11: Create a composite factor using daily return, daily range, and daily turnover rate
            Thought 12: Composite Factor = (daily_return[t] * daily_range[t] * daily_turnover_rate[t])
        Thought 13: Create another composite factor using daily return, daily range percentage, and daily amount change
            Thought 14: Composite Factor 2 = (daily_return[t] * daily_range_percentage[t] * daily_amount_change[t])
    Thought 15: Explore additional price patterns
        Thought 16: Calculate the price momentum over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
            Thought 17: Momentum = (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5]
        Thought 18: Calculate the price momentum over a longer period (e.g., 20 days)
            Thought 19: Momentum 20 = (close[t] - close[t-20]) / close[t-20]
    Thought 20: Incorporate price and volume changes
        Thought 21: Calculate the price-volume trend
            Thought 22: Price-Volume Trend = (close[t] - close[t-1]) / (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
        Thought 23: Calculate the price-amount trend
            Thought 24: Price-Amount Trend = (close[t] - close[t-1]) / (amount[t] - amount[t-1])
    Thought 25: Explore relative strength
        Thought 26: Calculate the relative strength compared to a benchmark index
            Thought 27: Relative Strength = close[t] / index_close[t]
