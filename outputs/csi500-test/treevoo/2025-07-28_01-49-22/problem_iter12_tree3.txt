High-Low Range Volatility and Momentum Adjusted by Volume and Close-Open Difference
├── Calculate Daily High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Calculate High-Low Range Ratio
│   ├── Use High-Low Range
│   └── Use Previous Day's High-Low Range
├── Smooth High-Low Range Ratio
│   ├── Set EMA Window Size (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Apply EMA on High-Low Range Ratio
├── Generate Alpha Factor from Momentum
│   ├── Compare with Baseline (Dynamic Threshold, e.g., Moving Average of Smoothed High-Low Range Ratio over 20 days)
│   │   ├── If Smoothed High-Low Range Ratio > Dynamic Threshold: Positive Signal
│   │   └── If Smoothed High-Low Range Ratio < Dynamic Threshold: Negative Signal
│   └── Multiply by Volume
│       ├── Use Volume
├── Calculate High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Sum Daily High-Low Ranges (n-period)
│   └── Divide by n
├── Adjust Volatility by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply Volatility by Exponential Moving Average of Volume (n-period)
└── Incorporate Close-Open Difference
    ├── Calculate Daily Close-Open Difference
    │   ├── Use Close price
    │   └── Use Open price
    └── Add Weighted Close-Open Difference to Adjusted Volatility
        ├── Use a Fixed Weight for the Close-Open Difference
        └── Combine with the Adjusted Volatility
