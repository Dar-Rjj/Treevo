Thought: Analyze price and volume trends for pattern recognition
- Sub-Thought: Examine the relationship between daily closing prices and future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the rate of change in closing prices over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
- Sub-Thought: Explore the impact of trading volume on stock returns
  - Sub-Thought: Investigate the correlation between increasing/decreasing volume and price movements
    - Sub-Thought: Identify instances where volume significantly deviates from the average
- Sub-Thought: Combine price and volume indicators to create a composite factor
  - Sub-Thought: Develop a momentum-based indicator using the combination of short-term price change and volume deviations
    - Sub-Thought: Create a factor by multiplying the rate of change in closing prices by the deviation of volume from its recent average
- Sub-Thought: Investigate the use of intraday high and low prices for volatility analysis
  - Sub-Thought: Construct a factor based on the difference between high and low prices as a measure of intraday volatility
    - Sub-Thought: Integrate the intraday volatility factor with the momentum-based indicator to form a more robust composite factor
- Sub-Thought: Consider the importance of market sentiment through open and close prices
  - Sub-Thought: Create a sentiment factor by comparing opening and closing prices
