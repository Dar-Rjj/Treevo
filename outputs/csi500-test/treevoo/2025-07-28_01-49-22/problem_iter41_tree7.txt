Crossover of Parent Tree 1 and Parent Tree 2
- Develop a Base Factor using Daily Return
-- Calculate daily return as (Close - Open) / Open
- Incorporate Volume into the Analysis
-- Determine average volume over the past N days
--- Use this to create a volume ratio factor: (Volume / Average Volume)
- Combine Price Movement and Volume for a Composite Score
-- Generate a weighted score combining daily return and volume ratio
--- Weighted Score = (Daily Return * Weight1) + (Volume Ratio * Weight2)
- Analyze High and Low Price Movements
-- Calculate the intra-day price range as (High - Low)
-- Standardize the intra-day movement: (Intra-day Range / Close)
- Incorporate Intra-day Movement into the Composite Score
-- Update the weighted score to include intra-day movement
--- Updated Weighted Score = (Weighted Score * Weight3) + (Standardized Intra-day Movement * Weight4)
- Create a Momentum Indicator
-- Compute the momentum over M days: (Close_today - Close_(M days ago)) / Close_(M days ago)
- Integrate Momentum with the Composite Score
-- Final Alpha Factor = (Updated Weighted Score * Weight5) + (Momentum * Weight6)
- Evaluate the Robustness of the Alpha Factor
-- Test the factor on historical data to ensure it is not overfitting
- Refine Weights and Parameters
-- Experiment with different weights (Weight1, Weight2, Weight3, Weight4, Weight5, Weight6) and parameters (N, M) to optimize the alpha factor
- Validate the Predictive Power
-- Assess the correlation between the alpha factor and future stock returns
- Implement the Alpha Factor in a Trading Strategy
-- Use the final alpha factor to rank stocks and implement a long-short strategy
