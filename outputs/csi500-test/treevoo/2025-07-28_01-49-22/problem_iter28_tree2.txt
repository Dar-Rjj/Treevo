- Exploring Price Patterns
  - Moving Averages
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA): Calculate the average closing price over a specified period.
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Calculate the EMA of the closing price, giving more weight to recent prices.
  - Price Difference Factors
    - Daily Price Change: Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close.
    - High-Low Spread: Calculate the difference between the high and low prices of the day.
  - Volatility Measures
    - Average True Range (ATR): Calculate the ATR over a specified period to measure volatility.
    - Historical Volatility: Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns over a specified period.
- Volume Analysis
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV): Accumulate volume on up days and subtract volume on down days.
  - Volume Oscillator: Calculate the difference between short-term and long-term moving averages of volume.
- Momentum Indicators
  - Rate of Change (ROC): Calculate the percentage change in price over a specified period.
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI): Measure the speed and change of price movements, based on the ratio of higher closes to lower closes.
- Trend Analysis
  - Directional Movement Index (DMI): Calculate the +DI and -DI to identify the strength and direction of the trend.
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Calculate the difference between a fast and slow EMA, and the signal line as an EMA of the MACD.
- Price-Volume Interaction
  - Price-Volume Trend (PVT): Calculate the cumulative sum of the product of the percentage change in closing price and the volume.
  - Negative Volume Index (NVI): Track the cumulative sum of price changes on days when volume decreases.
- Market Sentiment
  - Money Flow Index (MFI): Calculate the MFI to identify the money flow over a specified period.
  - Chaikin Oscillator: Calculate the difference between the 3-day and 10-day EMA of the Accumulation/Distribution Line.
