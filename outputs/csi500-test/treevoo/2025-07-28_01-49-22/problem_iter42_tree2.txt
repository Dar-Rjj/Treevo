Thought: Utilize price and volume data to create alpha factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate momentum based on close prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the 5-day simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create a momentum factor by subtracting the 10-day SMA from the 5-day SMA
- Sub-thought: Analyze volume trends
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the 20-day sum of volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the 10-day sum of volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Derive a volume flow factor by dividing the 10-day sum by the 20-day sum
- Sub-thought: Incorporate volatility using high and low prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the daily range (high - low)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the 30-day average of the daily range
  - Sub-sub-thought: Construct a volatility factor by taking the ratio of the current day's range to the 30-day average range
- Sub-thought: Explore patterns in open and close prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Determine the number of days in the past 5 where the close was higher than the open
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate a trend-following factor by normalizing this count
- Sub-thought: Investigate the relationship between amount and volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the 10-day sum of amount
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the 10-day sum of volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a liquidity factor by dividing the 10-day sum of amount by the 10-day sum of volume
- Sub-thought: Combine multiple factors for a composite alpha
  - Sub-sub-thought: Add the momentum, volume flow, and volatility factors
  - Sub-sub-thought: Assign weights to each factor based on historical performance
  - Sub-sub-thought: Sum the weighted factors to create a final composite alpha
