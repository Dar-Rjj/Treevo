Crossover Synthesized Intraday, Close-to-Close, and Volume Momentum with High-Low Range Adjustments
├── Calculate High-Low Range

│   ├── Volume Adjusted Intraday Range
│   ├── Add: Combined Value Momentum

├── Introduce Dynamic Threshold Adjustment
│   ├── Calculate 10-Day Moving Average of (High - Low) / (High + Low)
│   ├── If (High - Low) / (High + Low) (t) > 10-Day MA: Positive Signal

├── Adjust Intermediate Alpha Factor by High-Low Range Ratio
│   ├── If (High - Low) / (High + Low) (t) > 1.0: Multiply by 1.5
│   └── If (High - Low) / (High + Low) (t) < 1.0: Multiply by 0.5
