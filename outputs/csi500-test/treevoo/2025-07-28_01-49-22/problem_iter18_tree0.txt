Crossover of Intraday and High-Low Range Momentum with Volatility Adjusted by Volume and Close-Open Difference
├── Calculate Intraday Range Ratio
│   ├── Use High price
│   ├── Use Low price
│   └── Compute as (High - Low) / (High + Low)
├── Compute Volume Adjusted Intraday Range Ratio
│   ├── Use calculated Intraday Range Ratio
│   └── Multiply by Volume
├── Calculate Previous Day's Close-to-Open Change
│   ├── Use Previous Day's Close price
│   └── Use Today's Open price
│       └── Compute as (Today's Open - Previous Day's Close)
├── Calculate Daily High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Calculate High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Sum Daily High-Low Ranges (n-period)
│   └── Divide by n
├── Smooth High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Set EMA Window Size (e.g., 15 days)
│   └── Apply EMA on High-Low Range Volatility
├── Incorporate Close-Open Difference
│   ├── Calculate Daily Close-Open Difference
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Use Open price
│   └── Add Weighted Close-Open Difference to Smoothed High-Low Range Volatility
│       ├── Use a Fixed Weight for the Close-Open Difference
│       └── Combine with the Smoothed High-Low Range Volatility
├── Generate Combined Alpha Factor
│   ├── Combine Volume Adjusted Intraday Range Ratio and Previous Day's Close-to-Open Change
│   │   ├── Add Volume Adjusted Intraday Range Ratio
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close-to-Open Change
│   ├── Compare with Baseline (Dynamic Threshold, e.g., EMA of Smoothed High-Low Range Volatility)
│   │   ├── If Smoothed High-Low Range Volatility > Dynamic Threshold: Positive Signal
│   │   └── If Smoothed High-Low Range Volatility < Dynamic Threshold: Negative Signal
│   └── Adjust Combined Alpha Factor
│       ├── If Positive Signal: Multiply by 1.6
│       └── If Negative Signal: Multiply by 0.4
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Adjusted Combined Alpha Factor
    └── Multiply by Volume
        ├── Use Volume
