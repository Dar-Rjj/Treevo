- Consider daily (open, high, low, close) prices, amount, and volume for generating alpha factors
  - Focus on price patterns
    - Analyze the relationship between open, high, low, and close to identify trend reversals
      - Calculate daily price range (high - low) and compare it with previous day's range for volatility
        - Use the change in daily price range as a measure of increasing or decreasing market interest
      - Explore candlestick pattern formations (e.g., Doji, Hammer, Engulfing patterns)
        - Incorporate simple candlestick pattern recognition without historical normalization
  - Examine transactional data: Amount and Volume
    - Investigate volume spikes relative to the average of recent volumes
      - Develop a factor based on ratio of current day's volume to the moving sum of previous days' volumes
    - Assess the impact of large transactions on price movements
      - Create an indicator that marks days with unusually large transactions by comparing amount to a threshold
  - Utilize combined indicators from both price and transactional data
    - Integrate price action with transactional signals to form a composite factor
      - Combine the identification of significant candlestick patterns with the observation of volume spikes to signal potential future price direction
