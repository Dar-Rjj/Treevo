Thought 1: Analyze Price Patterns
    Thought 2: Calculate Price Differences
        Thought 3: Daily Price Change (close - open)
        Thought 4: High-Low Range (high - low)
        Thought 5: Open-Previous Close Difference (open - previous_close)
    Thought 6: Calculate Volume Adjusted Factors
        Thought 7: Volume-Weighted Price (volume * close)
        Thought 8: Volume-Weighted Average Price (volume * (open + high + low + close) / 4)
    Thought 9: Calculate Moving Averages
        Thought 10: Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Closing Prices
        Thought 11: Weighted Moving Average (WMA) of Closing Prices
    Thought 12: Calculate Momentum Indicators
        Thought 13: Rate of Change (ROC) (current_close / previous_n_period_close - 1)
        Thought 14: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) (12-period EMA - 26-period EMA)
    Thought 15: Calculate Volatility
        Thought 16: True Range (max(high - low, abs(high - previous_close), abs(low - previous_close)))
        Thought 17: Average True Range (ATR) (average of True Range over n periods)
Thought 18: Analyze Volume Patterns
    Thought 19: Volume Changes
        Thought 20: Volume Change (current_volume - previous_volume)
        Thought 21: Volume Oscillator (short-term moving average of volume - long-term moving average of volume)
    Thought 22: Volume Trend
        Thought 23: On-Balance Volume (OBV) (cumulative sum of volume adjusted for price direction)
        Thought 24: Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) ((close - low) - (high - close)) / (high - low) * volume
Thought 25: Analyze Amount Patterns
    Thought 26: Amount Trends
        Thought 27: Cumulative Amount (cumulative sum of amount)
        Thought 28: Amount Change (current_amount - previous_amount)
Thought 29: Analyze Combined Patterns
    Thought 30: Price-Volume Relationship
        Thought 31: Price-Volume Trend (PVT) (previous_PVT + (current_close - previous_close) / previous_close * current_volume)
        Thought 32: Negative Volume Index (NVI) (if volume < previous_volume, NVI = previous_NVI + (current_close - previous_close) / previous_close * 100, else NVI = previous_NVI)
