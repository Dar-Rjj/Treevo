│   ├── Compute 5-day Short-Term Moving Average (Close price)
│   └── Compute 20-day Long-Term Moving Average (Close price)
├── Determine Trend Direction
│   ├── Compare Short-Term and Long-Term Moving Averages
│   └── Assign +1 if Short-Term > Long-Term, -1 otherwise

└── Calculate Relative Strength
    ├── Subtract Long-Term Moving Average from Price Momentum
    └── Divide the result by Volume-Weighted Price Movement
        ├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Price Movement
        │   ├── Calculate Weighted Price (High, Low, Close prices * Volume)
        │   └── Sum the weighted price / total volume
