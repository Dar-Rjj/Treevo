Thought: Constructing Alpha Factors for Predicting Future Stock Returns
- Sub-thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Simple Price Momentum
    - Calculate (Close_t - Close_{t-n}) / Close_{t-n} for different n periods to identify trends.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Momentum
    - Compute VWAP for each day and then calculate the momentum of VWAP over a period.
- Sub-thought: Volatility Measures
  - Sub-sub-thought: True Range as a Measure of Volatility
    - Calculate the true range (TR) for each day: TR = max[(High_t - Low_t), abs(High_t - Close_{t-1}), abs(Low_t - Close_{t-1})].
    - Use the average true range (ATR) over n days to assess volatility.
- Sub-thought: Breakout Signals
  - Sub-sub-thought: High-Low Breakouts
    - Identify days where the closing price is above the highest high or below the lowest low of the previous n days as breakout signals.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Closing Price vs. Previous Day's Range
    - Calculate if close_t is outside the range [Low_{t-1}, High_{t-1}], indicating a potential breakout.
- Sub-thought: Accumulation/Distribution Indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Money Flow Index (MFI)
    - Compute the typical price (TP) as (High + Low + Close) / 3, then find positive and negative money flow over n days to derive MFI.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Calculate the money flow multiplier (MFM) as ((Close - Low) - (High - Close)) / (High - Low), multiply by volume, and sum over n days, then divide by the sum of volumes over n days.
- Sub-thought: Support and Resistance Levels
  - Sub-sub-thought: Pivot Points
    - Calculate pivot points using the formula: (High + Low + Close) / 3, then derive support and resistance levels.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Moving Averages as Dynamic Support/Resistance
    - Use simple moving averages (SMA) over n days as dynamic support and resistance levels.
- Sub-thought: Market Sentiment Indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Open-Close Spread
    - Analyze the difference between the open and close prices (Close_t - Open_t) to gauge market sentiment.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Volume Spike Analysis
    - Identify days with significant volume spikes and analyze their correlation with price movements.
