- Calculate the momentum factor
  - Use the close price of day t to calculate the return over the past 20 days
  - Subtract the return from the average return over the past 60 days up to day t
- Develop a volatility factor
  - Compute the standard deviation of daily returns over the last 30 days ending on day t
- Create an amplitude factor
  - Measure the difference between the high and low prices of day t
  - Sum the differences between the high and low prices over the last 10 days, ending on day t
- Generate a volume acceleration factor
  - Calculate the percentage change in volume from day t-1 to day t
  - Average the percentage change in volume over the last 5 days, ending on day t
- Construct a price-volume relationship factor
  - Multiply the return of day t (close price of day t / close price of day t-1) by the volume of day t
  - Aggregate the results for the last 10 days, with a weight that decreases linearly as the days go back
- Formulate a liquidity factor
  - Divide the volume of day t by the difference between the high and low prices of day t
  - Take the moving average of this ratio over the past 20 days, up to day t
- Devise a price reversal factor
  - Determine the direction of the price movement by comparing the open and close prices of day t
  - Multiply it by the absolute value of the difference between the high and low prices of day t
  - Compute the cumulative sum of these values over the previous week, up to day t
- Build a gap analysis factor
  - Assess if there is a gap between the close price of day t-1 and the open price of day t
  - If a gap exists, assign a score based on its size and direction
  - Accumulate the scores for gaps occurring over the last month, up to day t
- Explore a trade intensity factor
  - Combine the amount traded with the volume to estimate the average price per share traded on day t
  - Track the change in this average price per share over the last 5 days, up to day t
  - This tracks the intensity of trading activity at different price levels
- Investigate a trend strength factor
  - Evaluate the slope of a linear regression line fit to the close prices of the last 60 days, up to day t
  - A steeper positive or negative slope indicates a stronger trending market
- Examine a price action factor
  - Monitor patterns in the sequence of open, high, low, and close prices to identify specific bullish or bearish candlestick patterns
  - Assign a numerical score to each pattern, with higher scores indicating stronger signals
  - Sum the scores of identified patterns over the last 10 days, up to day t
- Analyze a support and resistance factor
  - Identify historical support and resistance levels by examining local minima and maxima in the price data
  - For the current day t, determine if the close price is near a support or resistance level
  - Assign a score based on the proximity and whether the price broke through the level
  - Aggregate the scores over the last month, up to day t
- Synthesize a composite sentiment factor
  - Blend multiple individual factors (e.g., momentum, volatility, and price-action) into a single score
  - The score reflects the overall sentiment of the market for day t
  - This can be used to predict future stock returns by considering the combined impact of multiple indicators
