Crossover Synthesis of Intraday Volume-Weighted Momentum and Integrated Cumulative Return, Momentum, and Intraday Strength Indicator with Enhanced Daily Performance Metrics
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Compute High-Low Range
│   └── Average Over n Days
├── Calculate Daily Return
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Lagged Close price

│   ├── Sum of Daily Returns
│   └── Over a specified window (e.g., 5 days)
├── Adjust by Volume
│   ├── Calculate Average Volume
│   │   ├── Sum of Volumes over the same window
│   │   └── Divide by window size

│       ├── Multiply by average volume
├── Adjust by Price Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Standard Deviation of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Over the same window
│   └── Final Adjustment
│       ├── Divide Cumulative Return by Standard Deviation
│       └── Ensure positive values by adding 1
├── Calculate Momentum
│   ├── Lookback Period of m Days
│   │   ├── Calculate Log Return
│   │   │   ├── Current Close
│   │   │   └── Close m Days Ago
│   │   └── Sum of Log Returns
├── Adjust by Intraday Volatility and Volume
│   ├── Multiply Sum of Log Returns by Volume
│   └── Divide by Intraday Volatility

├── Integrate Relative Strength and Adjusted Cumulative Return
│   ├── Subtract 50-day SMA from Momentum
│   └── Combine with Adjusted Cumulative Return
│       ├── Add the adjusted cumulative return to the relative strength
├── Calculate Intraday Movement
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Open price
│   └── Use Close price
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Sum of Intraday Movement and Close-to-Open Return
│   └── Weight by Price Range Ratio
│       ├── Use Price Range Ratio as weight
│       └── Multiply combined sum by Price Range Ratio
├── Synthesize Final Alpha Factor
│   ├── Add Relative Strength and Combined Factors
└── Output the final alpha factor
├── Calculate the difference between the closing price and the opening price
│   ├── Determine if the close price is higher than the open
│   │   ├── Count the number of consecutive days where the close is higher than the open
│   │   └── Calculate the average true range (ATR) over N days
│   │       ├── Use the ATR to weight the importance of each day's close-open difference within a window
├── Examine the ratio of the highest price to the lowest price on a given day
│   ├── Compute the average of this daily high-low ratio over a recent period
│   └── Integrate trading volume into this smoothed high-low ratio
│       ├── Create a weighted volatility score
├── Explore the relationship between the closing price and the typical price
│   ├── Subtract the typical price from the close and then accumulate these differences over a fixed period
│   └── Enhance this metric by introducing a dynamic adjustment factor based on the recent rate of change in the typical price
