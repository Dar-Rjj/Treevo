[Factor Construction]
- [Momentum Factors]
  - [Simple Price Momentum]
    - Calculate the close price difference between the current day and n days ago.
  - [Relative Strength Index (RSI) Momentum]
    - Compute the average of upward close price changes over the last n days.
    - Compute the average of downward close price changes over the last n days.
    - Derive RSI from the averages.
- [Volume Factors]
  - [Volume Trend]
    - Calculate the moving average of volume over the past n days.
    - Subtract this moving average from the current day's volume to assess trend.
  - [Volume Volatility]
    - Calculate the standard deviation of daily volumes over the past n days.
- [Volatility Factors]
  - [True Range]
    - Calculate the true range for each day as max(high-low, abs(high-close_prev), abs(low-close_prev)).
    - Sum the true ranges over the past n days.
  - [Average True Range (ATR)]
    - Compute the ATR by averaging the true ranges over the past n days.
- [Trend Following Factors]
  - [Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)]
    - Compute the short-term (e.g., 12-day) and long-term (e.g., 26-day) exponential moving averages (EMA) of the closing prices.
    - Derive MACD line by subtracting the long-term EMA from the short-term EMA.
  - [Signal Line]
    - Calculate the 9-day EMA of the MACD line.
- [Pattern Recognition Factors]
  - [Price Oscillator]
    - Calculate the difference between the current day's close and the n-day moving average of the close.
  - [Bollinger Bands]
    - Calculate the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of the close.
    - Calculate the 20-day standard deviation of the close.
    - Derive upper and lower Bollinger Bands using the SMA and standard deviation.
- [Combined Factors]
  - [Momentum and Volume]
    - Multiply the simple price momentum by the volume trend.
  - [Volatility and Trend]
    - Multiply the ATR by the MACD line.
  - [Pattern and Trend]
    - Multiply the price oscillator by the difference between the current close and the middle Bollinger Band.
