Thought: Calculate the difference between the closing price and the opening price as a simple measure of daily stock performance.
  Sub-Thought: Determine if the close price is higher than the open, indicating a positive day.
    Sub-Thought: Count the number of consecutive days where the close is higher than the open to identify trends in upward momentum.
      Sub-Thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over N days from high, low, and previous close prices to quantify volatility.
        Sub-Thought: Use the ATR to weight the importance of each day's close-open difference within a window, giving more weight to days with lower volatility for a refined momentum indicator.
  Sub-Thought: Examine the ratio of the highest price to the lowest price on a given day to evaluate intraday volatility or uncertainty.
    Sub-Thought: Compute the average of this daily high-low ratio over a recent period to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
      Sub-Thought: Integrate trading volume into this smoothed high-low ratio by multiplying the ratio with the volume, creating a weighted volatility score that accounts for market activity levels.
  Sub-Thought: Explore the relationship between the closing price and the average of the high and low prices (typical price) as a proxy for the central tendency of price action.
    Sub-Thought: Subtract the typical price from the close and then accumulate these differences over a fixed period to create a trend-following metric.
      Sub-Thought: Enhance this metric by introducing a dynamic adjustment factor based on the recent rate of change in the typical price, making it more responsive to shifts in the underlying trend.
