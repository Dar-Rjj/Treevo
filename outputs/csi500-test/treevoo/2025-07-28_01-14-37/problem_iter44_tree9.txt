Thought: Synthesize an Integrated Alpha Factor with Enhanced Momentum, Volume, and Intraday Analysis
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute Short-Term Moving Average (e.g., 5-day)
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Compute average
│   ├── Compute Long-Term Moving Average (e.g., 20-day)
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Compute average
│   └── Subtract today's SMA from yesterday's SMA to identify momentum shifts
├── Determine Trend Direction
│   ├── Calculate Short-Term and Long-Term Difference
│   │   ├── Subtract Long-Term from Short-Term
│   │   └── Assign +1 if positive, -1 otherwise
│   └── Confirm with Previous Day's Trend
│       └── Compare Current Day's Trend with Previous Day
│           └── Assign +1 if both positive or both negative, 0 if mixed
├── Enhance with Volume Confirmation
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   ├── Use Current Volume
│   │   ├── Use Previous Volume
│   │   └── Compute Difference
│   └── Adjust Trend by Volume Change
│       ├── Multiply Trend Direction by Volume Change
│       └── Apply a Threshold to Exclude Small Changes
│           ├── If Volume Change is below a threshold, set to 0
│           └── Otherwise, keep the calculated value
├── Calculate Relative Strength
│   ├── Subtract Long-Term Moving Average from Short-Term Moving Average
│   └── Divide the result by Volume-Weighted Price Movement
│       ├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Price Movement
│       │   ├── Calculate Weighted Price using High, Low, and Close prices
│       │   ├── Multiply by Volume
│       │   ├── Sum the weighted price
│       │   └── Divide by total volume
├── Evaluate Intraday Dynamics
│   ├── Calculate the difference between the close and open prices
│   │   ├── Subtract the open price from the close price on day t
│   ├── Measure the volatility using the high and low prices
│   │   ├── Calculate the range as the difference between the high and low prices on day t
│   ├── Calculate Daily Return
│   │   ├── Subtract Lagged Close from Current Close
│   ├── Calculate Cumulative Return
│   │   ├── Sum of Daily Returns Over 5 Days
│   └── Calculate Intraday Reversal Indicator
│       ├── Subtract High from Previous Close
│       └── Subtract Previous Close from Low
├── Integrate Volume and Transaction Value
│   ├── Compare the current day's volume to the average volume over the past m days (m < t)
│   ├── If the current volume is higher than the average, it might indicate strong buying or selling activity
│   ├── Calculate the total transaction value as the product of the close price and volume on day t
│   └── Assess if the transaction value is significantly different from the average transaction value over the past p days (p < t)
├── Analyze Volume and Amount Trends
│   ├── Calculate the daily volume change
│   │   └── Assess if volume changes significantly, indicating increased interest
│   └── Calculate the ratio of amount to volume
│       └── Use this ratio to infer average transaction size as an indicator of institutional activity
├── Identify Volatility Patterns
│   ├── Compute the range (high - low) for each day
│   │   └── Average the ranges over a given period to measure volatility
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   │   └── Compute High-Low Range
│   │       └── Average Over n Days
├── Explore Price Oscillators
│   ├── Calculate the difference between SMA of different periods (e.g., 50-day and 200-day)
│   │   └── This difference can indicate long-term price trends
├── Construct Reversal Signals
│   ├── Determine the number of days since the last highest high
│   │   └── Use this count as a contrarian signal, indicating potential overbought conditions
│   └── Track the number of days since the last lowest low
│       └── Use this count as a contrarian signal, indicating potential oversold conditions
├── Evaluate Price Action Relative to Moving Averages
│   ├── Calculate the distance between the current close and a key moving average
│   │   └── Use this distance to gauge the strength of the current trend
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Sum of Intraday Movement and Close-to-Open Return
│   └── Weight by Price Range Ratio
│
