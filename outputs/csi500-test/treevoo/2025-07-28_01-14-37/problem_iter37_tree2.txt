- Develop Raw Alpha Factors Using Historical Price Data
  - Calculate Momentum Indicators
    - Determine the simple moving average (SMA) of close prices over a specific period
      - Subtract today's SMA from yesterday's SMA to identify momentum shifts
    - Calculate the rate of change (ROC) in closing prices
      - Compare ROC with a fixed threshold to gauge upward or downward pressure
  - Analyze Volume and Amount Trends
    - Calculate the daily volume change
      - Assess if volume changes significantly, indicating increased interest
    - Calculate the ratio of amount to volume
      - Use this ratio to infer average transaction size as an indicator of institutional activity
  - Identify Volatility Patterns
    - Compute the range (high - low) for each day
      - Average the ranges over a given period to measure volatility
  - Explore Price Oscillators
    - Calculate the difference between SMA of different periods (e.g., 50-day and 200-day)
      - This difference can indicate long-term price trends
  - Construct Reversal Signals
    - Determine the number of days since the last highest high
      - Use this count as a contrarian signal, indicating potential overbought conditions
    - Track the number of days since the last lowest low
      - Use this count as a contrarian signal, indicating potential oversold conditions
  - Evaluate Price Action Relative to Moving Averages
    - Calculate the distance between the current close and a key moving average
      - Use this distance to gauge the strength of the current trend
