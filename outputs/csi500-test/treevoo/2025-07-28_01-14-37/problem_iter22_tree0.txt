Hybrid Volatility-Adjusted Momentum with Trend and Volume Confirmation
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Compute Weighted Momentum
│   ├── Multiply (High + Low + Close) / 3 by Volume
│   └── Divide Close Price Change (Current Close - Previous Close) by Weighted Momentum
├── Adjust for Volatility
│   ├── Divide Weighted Momentum by High-to-Low Range
├── Determine Trend Direction
│   ├── Compare 5-day Moving Average of Close Prices to 20-day Moving Average
│   └── Assign +1 if 5-day > 20-day, -1 otherwise
├── Incorporate Price Oscillator
│   ├── Subtract 5-day Exponential Moving Average of Close Prices from 20-day EMA
└── Final Factor = (Volatility-Adjusted Momentum * Trend Direction * Price Oscillator)
