Integrated Momentum and Volume Analysis
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-day Moving Average (Close price)
│   └── Compute 20-day Moving Average (Close price)
├── Determine Trend Direction
│   └── Compare 5-day vs 20-day Moving Averages
│       └── Assign +1 if 5-day > 20-day, -1 otherwise
├── Adjust Momentum by Volume Change
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change (Current Volume - Previous Volume)
│   └── Multiply Trend Direction by Volume Change
└── Calculate Relative Strength
    ├── Subtract 20-day Moving Average from 5-day Moving Average
    └── Divide the result by Volume-Weighted Price Movement
        ├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Price Movement
        │   ├── Calculate Weighted Price (High + Low + Close) * Volume
        │   ├── Sum the weighted prices
        │   └── Divide by total volume
