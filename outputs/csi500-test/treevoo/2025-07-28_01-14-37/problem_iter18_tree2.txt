Thought: Develop a set of alpha factors using the given (open, high, low, close) prices, amount, and volume data.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate momentum factors from historical price data
    - Sub-Thought: Use the closing price to calculate a simple moving average (SMA)
      - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 10-day SMA
      - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 30-day SMA
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the rate of change (ROC) over different periods
      - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 5-day ROC
      - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 20-day ROC
  - Sub-Thought: Derive volatility-based factors from daily returns
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate daily log-returns
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the standard deviation of daily returns as a measure of volatility
      - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 20-day rolling standard deviation
      - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 60-day rolling standard deviation
  - Sub-Thought: Create volume-related indicators
    - Sub-Thought: Measure the trend in trading volume
      - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 10-day moving average of volume
      - Sub-Thought: Determine the ratio between the current day's volume and the 10-day moving average volume
    - Sub-Thought: Introduce on-balance volume (OBV)
      - Sub-Thought: If the closing price is higher than the previous day’s closing, add the day’s volume to OBV
      - Sub-Thought: If the closing price is lower than the previous day’s closing, subtract the day’s volume from OBV
  - Sub-Thought: Utilize gap and range information for alpha generation
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily price range (high - low)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the up-gap (today's open - yesterday's close when it’s positive)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the down-gap (yesterday's close - today's open when it’s negative)
  - Sub-Thought: Incorporate money flow index (MFI) for additional insights
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate typical price (high + low + close) / 3
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate raw money flow (typical price * volume)
    - Sub-Thought: Determine positive and negative money flow
      - Sub-Thought: Positive money flow (when typical price > previous typical price)
      - Sub-Thought: Negative money flow (when typical price < previous typical price)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the MFI over a 14-day period
  - Sub-Thought: Leverage inter-day price relationships for factor creation
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage of days where the open is above/below the prior close
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage of days where the close is above/below the intra-day midpoint (average of high and low)
  - Sub-Thought: Explore patterns in candlestick formations
    - Sub-Thought: Identify bullish and bearish engulfing patterns
    - Sub-Thought: Count the number of consecutive doji days (where the open and close are almost the same)
