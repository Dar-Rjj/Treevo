Thought: Calculate the difference between the close price and the open price as a simple measure of daily momentum.
    Sub-Thought: Compute the 10-day moving average of the daily momentum to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate the 50-day moving average of the daily momentum for a longer-term trend.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between the 10-day and 50-day moving averages to identify potential changes in the trend.
                Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Use the sign of the difference between the 10-day and 50-day moving averages to determine if the short-term momentum is increasing or decreasing relative to the long-term momentum.
                    Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Multiply this sign by the absolute value of the 10-day moving average to create a scaled factor that indicates the strength and direction of the momentum shift.

Thought: Calculate the ratio of the high price to the low price to capture the intraday volatility.
    Sub-Thought: Compute the 20-day moving average of the intraday volatility to smooth out short-term noise.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Identify days where the intraday volatility is above its 20-day moving average, indicating higher than usual volatility.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate the number of such days in the past 10 days to quantify recent periods of high volatility.
                Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Use this count to create a factor that represents the frequency of high-volatility days.

Thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume from the previous day to gauge trading activity.
    Sub-Thought: Compute the 10-day moving average of the volume change to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Identify days where the volume change is significantly above its 10-day moving average, indicating unusually high trading activity.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate the number of such days in the past 5 days to quantify recent periods of high trading activity.
                Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Use this count to create a factor that represents the frequency of high trading activity days.
