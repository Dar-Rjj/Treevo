Synthesized Alpha Factor Development with Enhanced Momentum, Volume, and Intraday Analysis
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute Short-Term Moving Average (e.g., 5-day)
│   │   └── Use Close price
│   ├── Compute Long-Term Moving Average (e.g., 20-day)
│   │   └── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract today's SMA from yesterday's SMA to identify momentum shifts
├── Analyze Volume and Amount Trends
│   ├── Calculate the daily volume change
│   │   └── Assess if volume changes significantly, indicating increased interest
│   └── Calculate the ratio of amount to volume
│       └── Use this ratio to infer average transaction size as an indicator of institutional activity
├── Determine Trend Direction
│   ├── Calculate Short-Term and Long-Term Difference
│   │   └── Subtract Long-Term from Short-Term
│   │       └── Assign +1 if positive, -1 otherwise
│   └── Confirm with Previous Day's Trend
│       └── Compare Current Day's Trend with Previous Day
│           └── Assign +1 if both positive or both negative, 0 if mixed
├── Enhance with Volume Confirmation
│   ├── Adjust Trend by Volume Change
│   │   └── Multiply Trend Direction by Volume Change
│   │       └── Apply a Threshold to Exclude Small Changes
│   │           └── If Volume Change is below a threshold, set to 0
├── Calculate Relative Strength
│   ├── Subtract Long-Term Moving Average from Short-Term Moving Average
│   └── Divide the result by Volume-Weighted Price Movement
│       └── Calculate Volume-Weighted Price Movement
│           ├── Calculate Weighted Price
│           │   └── Use High, Low, and Close prices
│           │       └── Multiply by Volume
│           └── Sum the weighted price
│               └── Divide by total volume
├── Identify Volatility Patterns
│   ├── Compute the range (high - low) for each day
│   │   └── Average the ranges over a given period to measure volatility
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   │   └── Compute High-Low Range
│   │       └── Average Over n Days
├── Explore Price Oscillators
│   ├── Calculate the difference between SMA of different periods (e.g., 50-day and 200-day)
│   │   └── This difference can indicate long-term price trends
├── Construct Reversal Signals
│   ├── Determine the number of days since the last highest high
│   │   └── Use this count as a contrarian signal, indicating potential overbought conditions
│   └── Track the number of days since the last lowest low
│       └── Use this count as a contrarian signal, indicating potential oversold conditions
├── Evaluate Price Action Relative to Moving Averages
│   ├── Calculate the distance between the current close and a key moving average
│   │   └── Use this distance to gauge the strength of the current trend
├── Calculate Intraday Movement
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Sum of Intraday Movement and Close-to-Open Return
│   └── Weight by Price Range Ratio
│       └── Multiply combined sum by High-to-Low Range
├── Confirm with Volume
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Volume from Current Volume
│   └── Adjust Momentum by Volume Change
│       └── Multiply Trend Direction by Volume Change
├── Calculate Intraday Reversal Indicator
│   ├── Subtract High from Previous Close
│   └── Subtract Previous Close from Low
├── Integrate Intraday Reversal Indicator
│   ├── Multiply Intraday Reversal Indicator by Intraday Volatility
│   └── Add a smoothing factor to the result
│       └── Use a 3-day simple moving average to smooth the product
└── Synthesize Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Adjusted Volatility-Adjusted Momentum, Adjusted Cumulative Return, and Combined Factors
    ├── Multiply by Relative Strength
    ├── Add Intraday Reversal Indicator
    └── Output the final alpha factor
