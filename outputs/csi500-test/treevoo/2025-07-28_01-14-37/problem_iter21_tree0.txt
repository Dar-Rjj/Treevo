Hybrid Volatility-Adjusted Momentum with Volume and Trend Confirmation
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Compute Weighted Momentum
│   ├── Multiply (Sum of (High + Low + Close) / 3) by Volume
│   └── Divide Close Price Change by Weighted Momentum
│       ├── Subtract Previous Close from Current Close
├── Adjust for Volatility
│   ├── Divide Weighted Momentum by High-to-Low Range
├── Determine Trend Direction
│   ├── Compute Short-Term Moving Average (e.g., 5-day)
│   │   ├── Average of Close Prices
│   ├── Compute Long-Term Moving Average (e.g., 20-day)
│   │   ├── Average of Close Prices
│   └── Compare and Assign +1 if Short-Term > Long-Term, -1 otherwise
├── Incorporate Price Oscillator
│   ├── Calculate Short-Term Exponential Moving Average (e.g., 5-day)
