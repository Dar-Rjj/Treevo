Crossover Alpha Factor: Enhanced Volume-Adjusted Intraday and Price Momentum with High-Low Volatility
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute Short-Term EMA of Close Prices (10-day span)
│   ├── Compute Long-Term EMA of Close Prices (50-day span)
│   └── Subtract Short-Term EMA from Long-Term EMA
├── Calculate Intraday Momentum Swing
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Return (Close - Open)
│   └── Volume Weighted Adjusted Return (Volume * Intraday Return / 20-day average volume)
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price
│   ├── Use Low price
│   └── Multiply by Volume
├── Calculate 10-Day Volume-Weighted Moving Average of Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use Last 10 Days' Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spreads
│   └── Weight each spread by its corresponding volume
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Daily Price Change
│   ├── Subtract Previous Close (t-1) from Close price (t)
│   └── Multiply by Volume
├── Calculate 10-Day Moving Average of Volume-Adjusted Daily Price Change
│   └── Use Last 10 Days' Volume-Adjusted Daily Price Changes
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Add Price Momentum
│   ├── Proportional Movement Index (Intraday Price Range / Close * Intraday Return)
│   └── Add Volume Weighted Adjusted Return
├── Calculate High-Low Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Daily High-Low Range (High - Low)
│   ├── Compute 10-day Exponential Moving Average of High-Low Range
│   └── Normalize by Close Price (High-Low Range / Close)
├── Combine Volume-Adjusted Metrics, Price Momentum, and High-Low Volatility
│   ├── Use 10-Day Volume-Weighted Moving Average of Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Add to 10-Day Moving Average of Volume-Adjusted Daily Price Change
│   ├── Add to Price Momentum
│   └── Add to High-Low Volatility
└── Incorporate High-Low Range
    ├── Calculate Daily High-Low Spread (High - Low)
    └── Multiply by Combined Volume-Adjusted Metrics, Price Momentum, and High-Low Volatility
