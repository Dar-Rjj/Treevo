Thought: Explore basic price action for alpha generation
- Subthought: Calculate the daily return as (close[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1]
  - Subthought: Use daily return to identify momentum by averaging over a 5-day window
    - Subthought: Compute the 5-day moving average of daily returns
  - Subthought: Determine reversal signals by looking at the difference between the current day's return and the average of the last 5 days' returns
    - Subthought: Calculate the deviation of the current day's return from the 5-day moving average
- Subthought: Examine the relationship between opening and closing prices
  - Subthought: Compute the gap up/down ratio as (open[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1]
    - Subthought: Summarize the trend of the gap up/down over the past 10 days
      - Subthought: Calculate the 10-day moving average of the gap up/down ratio
  - Subthought: Analyze the daily movement from open to close
    - Subthought: Determine the intraday momentum as (close[t] - open[t]) / open[t]
      - Subthought: Use a 10-day moving average of intraday momentum to smooth out noise
        - Subthought: Calculate the 10-day moving average of the intraday momentum
- Subthought: Investigate the range of price within a day
  - Subthought: Calculate the true range as max(high[t] - low[t], abs(high[t] - close[t-1]), abs(low[t] - close[t-1]))
  - Subthought: Study the volatility by taking a 20-day moving average of the true range
    - Subthought: Calculate the 20-day moving average of the true range
- Subthought: Consider the volume in conjunction with price movements
  - Subthought: Measure the volume change as (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) / volume[t-1]
  - Subthought: Evaluate the volume-price relationship by multiplying the daily return with the volume change
    - Subthought: Apply a 5-day moving average to this product to capture sustained trends
      - Subthought: Calculate the 5-day moving average of the product of daily return and volume change
- Subthought: Incorporate the concept of accumulation/distribution using the amount traded
  - Subthought: Estimate the money flow as (close[t] - close[t-1]) * amount[t]
