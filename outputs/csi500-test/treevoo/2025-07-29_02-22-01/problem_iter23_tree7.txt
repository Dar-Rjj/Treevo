Thought: Develop novel, interpretable alpha factors from price and volume data for predicting future stock returns

  - Thought: Analyze trading patterns using open, high, low, close (OHLC) prices to infer future movements
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today's and yesterday's closing prices as a basic momentum indicator
      - Sub-Sub-Thought: Extend to calculate the rate of change over n-periods to measure trend strength
    - Sub-Thought: Measure the size of the trading range (high - low) to identify volatility
      - Sub-Sub-Thought: Apply a moving average to the daily range to smooth out short-term fluctuations in volatility
    - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the closing price relative to the daily range for a potential reversal or continuation signal
      - Sub-Sub-Thought: Introduce a 'range position' factor indicating where the close is within the high-low range
  
  - Thought: Incorporate volume information to assess market sentiment and liquidity
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) to understand average transaction pricing
      - Sub-Sub-Thought: Use VWAP deviations from the current price as a buying or selling signal
    - Sub-Thought: Investigate the relationship between volume spikes and significant price movements
      - Sub-Sub-Thought: Create a 'volume surge' factor that flags when volume exceeds a certain threshold over its moving average
    - Sub-Thought: Examine the direction of the market by comparing up-volume (volume on days the close is higher than the previous day) and down-volume (vice versa)
      - Sub-Sub-Thought: Formulate an 'accumulation/distribution' line to track institutional interest over time

  - Thought: Combine OHLC-derived factors with volume indicators to create hybrid alpha signals
    - Sub-Thought: Develop a 'momentum-volatility' factor by cross-multiplying the momentum indicator with the volatility factor
    - Sub-Thought: Generate a 'price-volume anomaly' factor that highlights discrepancies between price action and volume trends
      - Sub-Sub-Thought: This could involve identifying situations where prices move significantly without corresponding volume changes
    - Sub-Thought: Construct a 'liquidity adjusted return' factor that adjusts raw returns based on the level of liquidity (measured via volume)
      - Sub-Sub-Thought: Higher liquidity might suggest more confidence in the price movement, thereby adjusting the expected future return accordingly
