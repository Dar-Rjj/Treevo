Thought: Calculate Advanced Momentum Indicator as a Base Alpha Factor
- Sub-thought: Use the closing price of each day to calculate the momentum over N days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Define N as a parameter, e.g., 10, 20, or 30 days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the factor as (Close_t / Close_(t-N)) - 1 where t is today
- Sub-thought: Enhance the basic momentum with Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for N days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the VWAP for each day in the lookback period by summing up (price * volume) / total volume for each day
  - Sub-sub-thought: Utilize the VWAPs to compute a modified momentum: (VWAP_t / VWAP_(t-N)) - 1
- Sub-thought: Incorporate Range-based Volatility Measure
  - Sub-sub-thought: For the same N-day period, calculate the daily range (High - Low)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute an average true range (ATR) over N days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Adjust the momentum or VWAP momentum by dividing by the ATR
- Sub-thought: Introduce a Reversal Indicator based on Short-term Oversold/Overbought Conditions
  - Sub-sub-thought: Identify days when the closing price is at an extreme compared to the high and low over a short window, e.g., 5 days
  - Sub-sub-thought: Assign a reversal score, e.g., if close is near the 5-day low, consider it oversold; if near the 5-day high, overbought
  - Sub-sub-thought: Combine the reversal score with the momentum or VWAP momentum to refine the alpha factor
- Sub-thought: Investigate the Impact of Trading Volume Changes
  - Sub-sub-thought: Observe the change in trading volume over the last N days versus the previous M days
  - Sub-sub-thought: If the recent volume has increased significantly, possibly indicating stronger conviction in the move
  - Sub-sub-thought: Adjust the overall alpha factor by incorporating a volume change multiplier
  - Sub-sub-thought: Define thresholds for "significant" changes in volume, such as a 20% increase or decrease
- Sub-thought: Experiment with Different Time Frames for Each Component
  - Sub-sub-thought: Vary the lookback periods for momentum, VWAP, ATR, and volume analysis
  - Sub-sub-thought: Test combinations of different N and M values to find optimal parameters for various market conditions
- Sub-thought: Analyze Price Action Patterns
  - Sub-sub-thought: Identify common price action patterns such as hammer, doji, or engulfing patterns within the N-day period
  - Sub-sub-thought: Assign a score to each pattern based on its predictive power
  - Sub-sub-thought: Combine the pattern scores with the existing alpha factors
