Thought: Calculate the momentum factor based on the close price
    Sub-thought: Compute the 1-day return by (close_t - close_(t-1)) / close_(t-1)
        Sub-thought: Sum the 1-day return over the past 5 days to get a 5-day momentum
            Sub-thought: Use the 5-day momentum as an alpha factor

Thought: Develop a volatility factor using high and low prices
    Sub-thought: Calculate the daily range as (high_t - low_t) / close_t
        Sub-thought: Compute the 10-day moving average of the daily range
            Sub-thought: Use the 10-day moving average range as an alpha factor

Thought: Create a volume-based factor
    Sub-thought: Calculate the 1-day change in volume as (volume_t - volume_(t-1)) / volume_(t-1)
        Sub-thought: Compute the 20-day moving average of the 1-day change in volume
            Sub-thought: Use the 20-day moving average of the 1-day change in volume as an alpha factor

Thought: Incorporate the open and close prices for a gap factor
    Sub-thought: Calculate the gap as (open_t - close_(t-1)) / close_(t-1)
        Sub-thought: Compute the 30-day sum of the gap
            Sub-thought: Use the 30-day sum of the gap as an alpha factor
