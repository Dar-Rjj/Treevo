Crossover Alpha Factor: Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread and Price Momentum with Weighted Combined Momentum
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use Calculated High-Low Spread
│   └── Multiply by Volume
├── Calculate 10-Day Volume-Weighted Moving Average of Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use Last 10 Days' Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spreads
│   └── Weight each spread by its corresponding volume
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Daily Price Change
│   ├── Subtract Previous Close (t-1)
│   └── Use Close price (t)
│   └── Multiply by Volume
├── Calculate 10-Day Moving Average of Volume-Adjusted Daily Price Change
│   └── Use Last 10 Days' Volume-Adjusted Daily Price Changes
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute Short-Term Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Apply EMA with a span of 5 days
│   └── Compute Long-Term Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices
│       ├── Use Close price
│       └── Apply EMA with a span of 20 days
│   └── Subtract Short-Term EMA from Long-Term EMA
├── Combine Volume-Adjusted Metrics and Price Momentum
│   ├── Use 10-Day Volume-Weighted Moving Average of Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Add to 10-Day Moving Average of Volume-Adjusted Daily Price Change
│   └── Add to Price Momentum
├── Calculate Average Volume
│   ├── Set Lookback Window (N)
│   └── Sum Volumes Over N Days
│       └── Divide by N
├── Weighted Combined Momentum
│   ├── Multiply Combined Momentum by Average Volume
│   └── Result in Weighted Combined Momentum
└── Incorporate High-Low Range
    ├── Calculate Daily High-Low Spread
    │   ├── Use High price
    │   └── Use Low price
    ├── Multiply by Weighted Combined Momentum
    └── Result in Final Alpha Factor
