├── Enhanced Momentum Indicator
│   ├── Use the closing price of each day to calculate the momentum over N days
│   │   └── Define N as a parameter, e.g., 10, 20, or 30 days
│   │   └── Compute the factor as (Close_t / Close_(t-N)) - 1 where t is today
│   └── Enhance the basic momentum with Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for N days
│       ├── Calculate the VWAP for each day in the lookback period by summing up (price * volume) / total volume for each day
│       └── Utilize the VWAPs to compute a modified momentum: (VWAP_t / VWAP_(t-N)) - 1
├── Incorporate Range-based Volatility Measure
│   ├── For the same N-day period, calculate the daily range (High - Low)
│   ├── Compute an average true range (ATR) over N days
│   └── Adjust the momentum or VWAP momentum by dividing by the ATR
├── Introduce a Reversal Indicator based on Short-term Oversold/Overbought Conditions
│   ├── Identify days when the closing price is at an extreme compared to the high and low over a short window, e.g., 5 days
│   ├── Assign a reversal score, e.g., if close is near the 5-day low, consider it oversold; if near the 5-day high, overbought
│   └── Combine the reversal score with the momentum or VWAP momentum to refine the alpha factor
├── Investigate the Impact of Trading Volume Changes
│   ├── Observe the change in trading volume over the last N days versus the previous M days
│   ├── If the recent volume has increased significantly, possibly indicating stronger conviction in the move
│   └── Adjust the overall alpha factor by incorporating a volume change multiplier
│       └── Define thresholds for "significant" changes in volume, such as a 20% increase or decrease
├── Experiment with Different Time Frames for Each Component
│   ├── Vary the lookback periods for momentum, VWAP
