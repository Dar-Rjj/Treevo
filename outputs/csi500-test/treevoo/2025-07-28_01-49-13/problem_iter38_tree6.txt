    - Measure the Ratio of Today's Volume to the Average Volume Over the Past 20 Days
  - Sub-Thought: Examine Relationships Between Different Price Points
    - Calculate the Difference Between the Close and the Open (Day's Range)
    - Compute the Ratio of the Close to the High, and the Close to the Low
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Metrics
    - Intraday Range: High Price (t) - Low Price (t)
    - Intraday Midpoint: (High + Low) / 2 (t)
    - Intraday Midpoint to Open Ratio: Intraday Midpoint / Open Price (t)
    - Close-to-Open Return: Close Price (t) - Open Price (t)
    - Adjusted Close-to-Open Return: Close-to-Open Return / Intraday Range
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Use Amount and Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Close-to-Next Day Open Return over a Period
    - Use VWAP (day t) and Open Price (day t+1)
  - Sub-Thought: Combine and Adjust Factors
    - Multiply Intraday Midpoint to Open Ratio by Weighted Sum of Returns
    - Adjust by Max Close and Min Open over a period
    - Introduce Intraday Momentum Indicator
      - Difference between Intraday Midpoint and Previous Period's Intraday Midpoint
    - Introduce Intraday Range to Volume Ratio
      - Intraday Range / Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Final Adjustments
    - Combine Intraday Midpoint to Open Ratio and Close-to-Next Day Open Return
    - Adjust by Max Close and Min Open
  - Sub-Thought: Introduce Volatility Factor
    - Daily Volatility: High Price and Low Price
    - Smoothed Volatility: Exponential Moving Average
  - Sub-Thought: Combine Metrics
    - Weight Intraday Range by Volume-Weighted Momentum
    - Add Adjusted Close-to-Open Return to the weighted Intraday Range
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Price Change
    - Current Day's Close - Previous Day's Close
  - Sub-Thought: Compute Cumulative Price Change
    - Cumulative Sum on Daily Price Changes
  - Sub-Thought: Compute Cumulative Price Momentum
    - Exponential Moving Average on Daily Price Change
  - Sub-Thought: Final Factor Adjustment
    - Combine the adjusted intraday factor with the cumulative momentum factor
  - Sub-Thought: Incorporate Short-Term Momentum and Volume
    - Calculate the difference between today's closing price and the average of the previous 5 days' closing prices
    - Divide this difference by the standard deviation of the past 5 days' closing prices
    - Compute the ratio of today’s volume to the average volume over the past 5 days
    - Multiply the momentum factor by the volume ratio
    - Consider the directional movement by comparing today's high and low with yesterday's
    - Add a binary (1 or 0) based on the condition that today's high is higher than yesterday's high AND today's low is also higher
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate Combined Momentum and Volume Factor
    - Multiply the final adjusted intraday factor with the combined short-term momentum and volume factor
