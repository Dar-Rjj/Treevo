Thought: Develop Price Momentum Indicators
    Subthought: Calculate short-term (e.g., 5-day) and long-term (e.g., 20-day) moving averages of the closing prices.
        Subthought: Compute the percentage change in the moving averages to identify trends.
    Subthought: Evaluate the Rate of Change (ROC) using closing prices over different periods (e.g., 10, 20, 30 days).
        Subthought: Calculate the difference between the current ROC and its past value to detect acceleration or deceleration.
    Subthought: Implement a simple Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator without normalization.
        Subthought: Use the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages of the closing prices.
        Subthought: Track the 9-day exponential moving average of the MACD line (signal line).
        Subthought: Measure the difference between the MACD line and the signal line to indicate potential buy or sell signals.

Thought: Analyze Volume and Amount Patterns
    Subthought: Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for each day.
        Subthought: Monitor the deviation of the close price from the VWAP to gauge market sentiment.
    Subthought: Examine the relationship between trading volume and price changes.
        Subthought: Identify days where high volume coincides with significant price movements.
    Subthought: Investigate the cumulative amount traded over different time horizons.
        Subthought: Compare the cumulative amount with the cumulative volume to highlight periods of high-value trading activity.
    Subthought: Compute the ratio of the current day's volume to the previous day's volume.
        Subthought: Highlight sudden spikes or drops in volume to signal potential market events.

Thought: Explore Volatility and Range Indicators
    Subthought: Calculate the true range (highest high minus lowest low for the day) to measure daily volatility.
        Subthought: Sum the true ranges over a period (e.g., 14 days) to form an average true range (ATR).
        Subthought: Use the ATR to identify periods of high or low volatility.
    Subthought: Assess the high-low range as a percentage of the closing price.
        Subthought: Trend the percentage range over time to identify tightening or expanding volatility.
    Subthought: Calculate the Bollinger Bands around the closing price.
        Subthought: Set the bands at 2 standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average.
        Subthought: Track the distance between the upper and lower bands to infer market conditions.
        Subthought: Observe the position of the close price relative to the Bollinger Bands to anticipate reversals.

Thought: Integrate Multiple Factors into Composite Indicators
    Subthought: Combine the momentum, volume, and volatility factors into a composite score.
        Subthought: Assign weights to each factor based on their historical predictive power.
        Subthought: Sum the weighted factors to create a composite alpha factor.
    Subthought: Create a trend-following indicator that integrates the direction and strength of the momentum.
        Subthought: Use the composite score to generate a buy/sell signal when it crosses a threshold.
    Subthought: Develop a contrarian indicator by inverting the trend-following indicator.
        Subthought: Signal buy when the contrarian indicator is very negative and sell when it is very positive.
