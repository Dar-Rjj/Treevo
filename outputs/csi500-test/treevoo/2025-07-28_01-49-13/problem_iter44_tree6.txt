Generate novel and interpretable alpha factors by synthesizing price, volume, and market dynamics
- Calculate simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
  - Analyze the slope of SMA to identify trends
    - Formula: Slope(SMA(Close, short_window))
- Calculate exponential moving average (EMA) of close prices
  - Examine the rate of change in EMA for short-term momentum
    - Formula: RateOfChange(EMA(Close, short_term))
- Determine the difference between EMA and SMA
  - Analyze if the difference can indicate market momentum
    - Evaluate the duration and magnitude of the EMA-SMA difference
      - Formula: EMA(Close, short_term) - SMA(Close, long_window)
- Analyze the high-low spread (High - Low)
  - Assess volatility by comparing daily high-low spreads
    - Investigate the rolling mean of high-low spreads for trend analysis
      - Formula: Mean(High_t - Low_t, window)
- Evaluate the open-close price change
  - Investigate patterns in the opening and closing prices over time
    - Identify the frequency of consecutive up or down days
      - Formula: (Close_t - Open_t)
- Measure trading volume trends
  - Examine the relationship between volume changes and price movements
    - Analyze the ratio of current volume to the average volume over a period
      - Formula: Volume_t / Mean(Volume, window)
- Combine multiple indicators
  - Integrate price and volume signals for a composite factor
    - Use the combined indicator to potentially predict future returns
    - Incorporate the open-close price change and high-low spread into the composite factor
      - Evaluate the effectiveness of the composite factor in different market conditions
- Sub-Thought: Price Momentum and Volatility Analysis
  - Daily Price Momentum
    - Formula: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
  - Intraday Return Adjusted by High-Low Range
    - Formula: ((Close_t - Open_t) / (High_t - Low_t))
- Sub-Thought: Volume and Trading Activity Analysis
  - Volume Change
    - Formula: Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}
  - Dollar Volume
    - Formula: Amount_t * Close_t
  - Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Momentum
    - Formula: (VWAP_t - Open_t) / VWAP_t
- Sub-Thought: Technical Indicators and Signals
  - Moving Averages and Crossovers
    - Formula: SMA(Close, short_window) - SMA(Close, long_window)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Formula: RSI(Close, window)
  - MACD
    - Formula: MACD = EMA(Close, short_term) - EMA(Close, long_term)
- Sub-Thought: Market Sentiment Analysis
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Formula: OBV_t = OBV_{t-1} + (Volume_t * (Close_t > Close_{t-1}))
- Sub-Thought: Volume Spike and Reversal Detection
  - Intraday Reversal
    - Formula: (High_t - Open_t) / (High_t - Low_t)
  - Intraday Reversal Adjustment
    - Formula: If (Intraday Reversal > 0.5), reduce factor by 20%
- Final Alpha Factor Integration
  - Formula: Final Alpha Factor = (Daily Price Momentum * (Close_t - Open_t) * (SMA(Close, short_window) - SMA(Close, long_window)) * RSI(Close, window) * MACD * OBV * Intraday Reversal Adjustment)
