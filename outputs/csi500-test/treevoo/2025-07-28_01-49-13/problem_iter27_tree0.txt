- Constructing Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume Data
  - Exploring Price Movement Patterns
    - Calculating Daily Price Range: (High - Low)
      - Investigating the relationship between daily price range and next day's return
    - Analyzing Close to Open Returns: (Close(t) - Open(t)) / Open(t)
      - Studying the impact of close-to-open returns on future stock performance
  - Examining Volume-related Indicators
    - Determining Average Volume Over N Days: Mean(Volume, N)
      - Assessing the predictive power of average volume on upcoming price movements
    - Calculating Volume Price Trend (VPT): VPT(t) = VPT(t-1) + (Volume * ((Close - Close(t-1)) / Close(t-1)))
      - Evaluating VPT as a momentum indicator for predicting changes in stock prices
  - Incorporating Amount Data Insights
    - Calculating Daily Transaction Amount: Close * Volume
      - Linking transaction amount to stock price predictability
    - Analyzing Change in Transaction Amount: (Transaction Amount(t) - Transaction Amount(t-1)) / Transaction Amount(t-1)
      - Investigating how fluctuations in transaction amount correlate with future returns
  - Integrating Multiple Factors
    - Combining Price and Volume Signals: (Price Signal) * (Volume Signal)
      - Creating a composite alpha factor by multiplying selected price and volume signals
    - Evaluating the Composite Factor's Performance Over Different Time Horizons
