  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Rate of Change in Adjusted Closing Price
    - Over Last 5 Days
    - Over Last 20 Days
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate Exponential Moving Average Crossovers
    - Compare 5-day and 20-day Exponential Moving Averages
  - Sub-Thought: Assess Volatility-Adjusted Returns
    - Use Average True Range Over Past 20 Days as Volatility Measure
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze Volume-Based Indicators
    - Measure the Ratio of Today's Volume to the Exponential Moving Average Volume Over the Past 20 Days
  - Sub-Thought: Examine Relationships Between Different Price Points
    - Calculate the Difference Between the Close and the Open (Day's Range)
    - Compute the Ratio of the Close to the High, and the Close to the Low
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Metrics
    - Intraday Range: High Price (t) - Low Price (t)
    - Intraday Midpoint: (High + Low) / 2 (t)
    - Intraday Midpoint to Open Ratio: Intraday Midpoint / Open Price (t)
    - Close-to-Open Return: Close Price (t) - Open Price (t)
    - Adjusted Close-to-Open Return: Close-to-Open Return / Intraday Range
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Use Amount and Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate VWAP-to-Next Day Open Return over a Period
    - Use VWAP (day t) and Open Price (day t+1)
  - Sub-Thought: Combine and Adjust Factors
    - Multiply Intraday Midpoint to Open Ratio by Weighted Sum of Returns
    - Adjust by Max Close and Min Open over a period
    - Introduce Intraday Momentum Indicator
      - Difference between Intraday Midpoint and Previous Period's Intraday Midpoint
    - Introduce Intraday Range to Volume Ratio
      - Intraday Range / Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Final Adjustments
    - Combine Intraday Midpoint to Open Ratio and VWAP-to-Next Day Open Return
    - Adjust by Max Close and Min Open
  - Sub-Thought: Introduce Smoothed Volatility Factor
    - Daily Volatility: High Price and Low Price
    - Smoothed Volatility: Exponential Moving Average
  - Sub-Thought: Combine Metrics
    - Weight Intraday Range by Volume-Weighted Momentum
    - Add Adjusted Close-to-Open Return to the weighted Intraday Range
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Adjusted Price Change
    - Current Day's Close - Previous Day's Close
  - Sub-Thought: Compute Cumulative Adjusted Price Change
    - Cumulative Sum on Daily Adjusted Price Changes
  - Sub-Thought: Compute Cumulative Adjusted Price Momentum
    - Exponential Moving Average on Daily Adjusted Price Change
  - Sub-Thought: Final Factor Adjustment
    - Combine the adjusted intraday factor with the cumulative adjusted momentum factor
