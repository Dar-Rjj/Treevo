Thought: Synthesize momentum, volatility, and volume-based alpha factors
  Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today's closing price and the average of the previous 5 days' closing prices to capture short-term momentum
    Sub-Thought: To add depth, calculate the standard deviation of the past 5 days' closing prices and divide the above difference by this standard deviation. This adjusts for volatility, making the factor more robust
      Sub-Thought: Incorporate trading volume into the analysis by computing the ratio of today’s volume to the average volume over the past 5 days. Multiply this ratio by the previously calculated momentum factor to weigh the momentum signal by volume strength
        Sub-Thought: As a final layer, consider the directional movement by comparing today's high and low with yesterday's. If today's high is higher than yesterday's high AND today's low is also higher, it indicates a bullish trend. Add a binary (1 or 0) based on this condition to the overall factor to reinforce the momentum signal
  Sub-Thought: Develop multi-period momentum factors
    Sub-Thought: Short-term (2 days) price change
      Sub-Thought: Today's close minus the close from 2 days ago
    Sub-Thought: Medium-term (10 days) price change
      Sub-Thought: Today's close minus the close from 10 days ago
    Sub-Thought: Long-term (30 days) price change
      Sub-Thought: Today's close minus the close from 30 days ago
    Sub-Thought: Combine short, medium, and long-term price changes
      Sub-Thought: Weighted sum of short, medium, and long-term price changes
  Sub-Thought: Analyze moving average crossovers
    Sub-Thought: Short-term (7 days) and medium-term (25 days) moving averages
      Sub-Thought: 7-day SMA minus 25-day SMA
    Sub-Thought: Medium-term (25 days) and long-term (60 days) moving averages
      Sub-Thought: 25-day SMA minus 60-day SMA
    Sub-Thought: Short-term (7 days) and long-term (60 days) moving averages
      Sub-Thought: 7-day SMA minus 60-day SMA
  Sub-Thought: Explore volatility-based alpha factors
    Sub-Thought: Calculate historical volatility over different time periods
      Sub-Thought: Daily log returns
        Sub-Thought: Standard deviation of daily log returns over 30 days
    Sub-Thought: Analyze high-low range
      Sub-Thought: Average true range (ATR) over 21 days
        Sub-Thought: Calculate ATR using the high, low, and close prices
      Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of today's high-low range to the average high-low range
        Sub-Thought: (Today's High - Today's Low) / Average High-Low Range over 30 days
  Sub-Thought: Generate volume-based alpha factors
    Sub-Thought: Calculate on-balance volume (OBV)
      Sub-Thought: OBV increment if today's close is higher than yesterday's close
      Sub-Thought: OBV decrement if today's close is lower than yesterday's close
      Sub-Thought: OBV unchanged if today's close equals yesterday's close
    Sub-Thought: Calculate volume rate of change (VROC) over different periods
      Sub-Thought: 2-day VROC
        Sub-Thought: (Today's volume - Volume from 2 days ago) / Volume from 2 days ago
      Sub-Thought: 21-day VROC
        Sub-Thought: (Today's volume - Volume 21 days ago) / Volume 21 days ago
      Sub-Thought: 50-day VROC
        Sub-Thought: (Today's volume - Volume 50 days ago) / Volume 50 days ago
  Sub-Thought: Formulate pattern recognition alpha factors
    Sub-Thought: Identify common candlestick patterns
      Sub-Thought: Bullish engulfing pattern
        Sub-Thought: Today's open below yesterday's close, and today's close above yesterday's open
      Sub-Thought: Bearish engulfing pattern
        Sub-Thought: Today's open above yesterday's close, and today's close below yesterday's open
      Sub-Thought: Doji pattern
        Sub-Thought: Today's open and close are approximately equal
      Sub-Thought: Hammer pattern
        Sub-Thought: Today's close is above the midpoint of the high-low range, and today's low is significantly lower than the open
      Sub-Thought: Shooting star pattern
        Sub-Thought: Today's close is below the midpoint of the high-low range, and today's high is significantly higher than the close
