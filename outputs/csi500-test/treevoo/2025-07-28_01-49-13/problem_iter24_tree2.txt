Performing alpha mining to generate novel and interpretable factors for predicting future stock returns
    Using price data (open, high, low, close) and volume
        Calculate daily return as (close - open)/open
            Compute the sum of positive daily returns over the past 20 days
                Generate a factor by dividing this sum by the total number of days considered
            Compute the sum of negative daily returns over the past 20 days
                Generate a second factor by dividing this sum by the total number of days considered
        Calculate the average trading volume over the last 10 days
            Compare the current day's volume with the 10-day average
                If today's volume is higher, assign a positive score; otherwise, a negative score
                Generate a third factor based on this comparison
        Analyze the relationship between the highest and lowest prices over the past 5 days
            Calculate the ratio of the average high price to the average low price
                Use this ratio as a fourth factor
