Thought: Explore price patterns and trading volume dynamics to identify predictive alpha factors
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze the relationship between closing price momentum and future returns
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today's close and the close n days ago
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Determine if this momentum is positive or negative
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Observe if a positive momentum continues to yield positive returns in the short term
  - Sub-Thought: Investigate the impact of daily trading range on future performance
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Compute the true range (max(high-low, abs(high-close[t-1]), abs(low-close[t-1])))
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Assess if larger ranges predict higher volatility and potential for reversal or continuation
  - Sub-Thought: Examine the role of volume in price movements
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Measure the percentage change in volume from the previous day
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Consider if a significant increase in volume precedes a price trend
  - Sub-Thought: Study the effect of gaps (difference between open and close of adjacent days) on stock performance
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Identify upward and downward gaps
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Evaluate if gaps tend to be filled and how quickly
  - Sub-Thought: Look into the interaction between opening and closing prices
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate the number of times the close is higher than the open over the past n days
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Explore if a consistent pattern of closing above the open signals strength
  - Sub-Thought: Incorporate the effect of high and low prices within the trading day
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Check if the position of the close relative to the high and low hints at market sentiment
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: See if the frequency of close near the high/low over several days predicts a trend
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate information from multiple alpha factors
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Combine insights from momentum, range, volume, gaps, and intraday positions
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Use a weighted scoring system based on empirical evidence of each factor's predictiveness
