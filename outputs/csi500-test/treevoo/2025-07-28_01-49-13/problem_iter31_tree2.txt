Performing alpha mining by generating novel, interpretable alpha factors for predicting future stock returns
- Using price and volume data to create momentum and volatility indicators
  - Momentum Indicators
    - Calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the close price over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
    - Subtract this SMA from the current close price to indicate short-term momentum
  - Volatility Indicators
    - Calculate the True Range as max(high - low, abs(high - previous_close), abs(low - previous_close))
    - Sum the True Range over a period (e.g., 14 days) to get Average True Range (ATR), reflecting volatility
- Incorporating Volume for additional insights
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV) Calculation
    - If the close price is higher than the previous close, add today's volume; otherwise, subtract it
    - OBV can confirm the direction of the trend
- Combining Indicators for Enhanced Alpha Factors
  - Create a Momentum-Volatility Ratio
    - Divide the short-term momentum value by the ATR
    - This factor identifies high-momentum stocks with relatively lower volatility, indicating potential for more steady returns
  - OBV Trend Confirmation
    - Compare the trend of OBV with the trend of the closing prices
    - Positive or negative confirmation enhances the predictive power of the momentum and volatility factors
