Performing alpha mining by generating novel, interpretable alpha factors for predicting future stock returns using advanced price and volume data analysis
- Using price and volume data to create momentum, volatility, and intraday indicators
  - Momentum Indicators
    - Calculating the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the close price over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
    - Subtracting this EMA from the current close price to indicate short-term momentum
    - Calculate the rate of change over a defined period (Momentum)
    - Determine the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) using close prices
  - Volatility Indicators
    - Calculating the True Range as max(high - low, abs(high - previous_close), abs(low - previous_close))
    - Summing the True Range over a period (e.g., 14 days) to get Average True Range (ATR), reflecting volatility
    - Measure the standard deviation of price changes
  - Intraday Indicators
    - Calculate the intraday range (High - Low)
    - Measure the intraday price movement (Close - Open)
    - Determine the intraday midpoint ((High + Low) / 2)
    - Compute the intraday midpoint to open ratio (Intraday Midpoint / Open)
    - Adjust close-to-open return by intraday range
      - Calculate Close-to-Open Return (Close - Open)
      - Adjust by dividing by Intraday Range
- Incorporating Volume for additional insights
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV) Calculation
    - If the close price is higher than the previous close, add today's volume; otherwise, subtract it
    - OBV can be used to confirm the direction of the trend
  - Examine trading volume for insights
    - Assess the relationship between price and volume
      - Compute the volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
      - Calculate the volume-weighted volatility (Intraday Range / Sum of Volume)
      - Introduce intraday range to volume ratio (Intraday Range / Volume)
- Combining Indicators for Enhanced Alpha Factors
  - Creating a Momentum-Volatility Ratio
    - Divide the short-term momentum value by the ATR
    - This factor helps in identifying high-momentum stocks with relatively lower volatility, indicating potential for more steady returns
  - OBV Trend Confirmation
    - Comparing the trend of OBV with the trend of the closing prices
    - A positive or negative confirmation can enhance the predictive power of the momentum and volatility factors
  - Develop factors based on combined metrics
    - Weighted sum of Momentum, ATR, and Volume-Range Ratio
    - Incorporate adjusted close-to-open return by intraday range
    - Integrate volume-weighted volatility
  - Calculate close-to-next day open return over a period
    - Use VWAP (day t) and Open price (day t+1)
    - Weighted sum of returns by volume
  - Calculate close-to-open envelope
    - Find Max Close and Min Open over a period
    - Adjust by combining envelopes with intraday midpoint to open ratio
  - Final adjustments
    - Combine intraday midpoint to open ratio and close-to-next day open return
    - Adjust by combined envelopes
      - Use Max Close and Min Open
      - Use Max Adjusted Close-to-Open Return and Min Open
  - Incorporate new intraday volatility factor
    - Calculate the intraday volatility (Standard Deviation of intraday price changes over a period)
    - Adjust the combined alpha factors by incorporating intraday volatility
  - Introduce a new trading range factor
    - Calculate the trading range (High - Low) over a longer period (e.g., 20 days)
    - Use the trading range to normalize the combined alpha factors
