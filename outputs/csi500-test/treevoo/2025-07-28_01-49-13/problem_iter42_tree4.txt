Thought: Constructing alpha factors based on price and volume data
- Sub-thought: Utilize daily return as a base factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate daily log return
    - Sub-thought: Log(Close_t / Close_{t-1})
- Sub-thought: Incorporate information from high, low, and close prices
  - Sub-thought: Williams %R for momentum
    - Sub-thought: (Highest High - Close) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) over N days
  - Sub-thought: True Range and Average True Range (ATR) for volatility
    - Sub-thought: True Range = Max(High, Previous Close) - Min(Low, Previous Close)
    - Sub-thought: ATR = Moving average of True Ranges over N days
- Sub-thought: Use volume to identify trading activity
  - Sub-thought: Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
    - Sub-thought: VWMA = Sum(Volume * Close) / Sum(Volume) over N days
  - Sub-thought: Money Flow Index (MFI) for money flow
    - Sub-thought: Positive Money Flow = Sum(Positive Money Flow) over N days
    - Sub-thought: Negative Money Flow = Sum(Negative Money Flow) over N days
    - Sub-thought: MFI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Positive Money Flow / Negative Money Flow)))
- Sub-thought: Combine factors to create a composite alpha signal
  - Sub-thought: Create a weighted sum of selected factors
    - Sub-thought: Composite Alpha = w1 * Daily Log Return + w2 * Williams %R + w3 * ATR + w4 * MFI
  - Sub-thought: Introduce a threshold for trade signals
    - Sub-thought: Buy if Composite Alpha > Threshold
    - Sub-thought: Sell if Composite Alpha < -Threshold
