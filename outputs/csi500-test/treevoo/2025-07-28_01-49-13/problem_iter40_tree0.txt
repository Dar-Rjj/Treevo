Thought: Synthesize momentum, volatility, and volume-based alpha factors
  Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today's closing price and the average of the previous 5 days' closing prices to capture short-term momentum
    Sub-Thought: Adjust for volatility by dividing the above difference by the standard deviation of the past 5 days' closing prices
      Sub-Thought: Incorporate trading volume by computing the ratio of today’s volume to the average volume over the past 5 days. Multiply this ratio by the adjusted momentum factor
        Sub-Thought: Add a binary (1 or 0) based on if today's high is higher and low is higher than yesterday's, reinforcing the momentum signal
  Sub-Thought: Develop multi-period momentum factors
    Sub-Thought: Short-term (2 days) price change: Today's close minus the close from 2 days ago
    Sub-Thought: Medium-term (10 days) price change: Today's close minus the close from 10 days ago

    Sub-Thought: On-balance volume (OBV)
    Sub-Thought: Volume rate of change (VROC) over different periods
      Sub-Thought: 2-day VROC
      Sub-Thought: 21-day VROC
      Sub-Thought: 50-day VROC
  Sub-Thought: Formulate pattern recognition alpha factors
