Generate novel and interpretable alpha factors
- Calculate simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
  - Evaluate the SMA over different time periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days)
- Calculate exponential moving average (EMA) of close prices
  - Evaluate the EMA over different time periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days)
- Determine the difference between EMA and SMA
  - Analyze if the difference can indicate market momentum
  - Consider the rate of change in the difference
- Analyze the high-low spread (High - Low)
  - Assess volatility by comparing daily high-low spreads
  - Calculate the average high-low spread over a moving window
- Evaluate the open-close price change
  - Investigate patterns in the opening and closing prices over time
  - Calculate the percentage change between open and close prices
- Measure trading volume trends
  - Examine the relationship between volume changes and price movements
  - Calculate the volume moving average over different periods
- Combine multiple indicators
  - Integrate price and volume signals for a composite factor
  - Use the combined indicator to potentially predict future returns
  - Incorporate the high-low spread into the composite factor
- Explore the relationship between amount and volume
  - Calculate the average transaction size (amount / volume)
  - Analyze the trend in the average transaction size
