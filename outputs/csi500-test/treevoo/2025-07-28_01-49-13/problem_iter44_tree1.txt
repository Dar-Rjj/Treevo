Thought: Hybrid Alpha Factor Development Using Price, Volume, and Market Dynamics with Intraday Insights
- Sub-Thought: Price Momentum and Volatility Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: Daily Price Momentum
    - Formula: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
  - Sub-Thought: Daily Price Range
    - Formula: High_t - Low_t
  - Sub-Thought: Intraday Return Adjusted by High-Low Range
    - Formula: ((Close_t - Open_t) / (High_t - Low_t))
- Sub-Thought: Volume and Trading Activity Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: Volume Change
    - Formula: Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}
  - Sub-Thought: Dollar Volume
    - Formula: Amount_t * Close_t
  - Sub-Thought: Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Momentum
    - Formula: (VWAP_t - Open_t) / VWAP_t
- Sub-Thought: Technical Indicators and Signals
  - Sub-Thought: Moving Averages and Crossovers
    - Formula: SMA(Close, short_window) - SMA(Close, long_window)
  - Sub-Thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Formula: RSI(Close, window)
  - Sub-Thought: MACD
    - Formula: MACD = EMA(Close, short_term) - EMA(Close, long_term)
- Sub-Thought: Intraday Momentum with Envelopes
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Range
    - Use High price
    - Use Low price
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Midpoint to Open Ratio
    - Use (High + Low) / 2
    - Use Open price
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Close-to-Next Day Open Return
    - Use VWAP (day t)
    - Use Open price (day t+1)
  - Sub-Thought: Weighted Sum of Returns by Volume
    - Use Close-to-Next Day Open Return
    - Use Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Close-to-Open Envelope
    - Use Close price
      - Find Max Close over a period
    - Use Open price
      - Find Min Open over a period
  - Sub-Thought: Introduce Volatility Factor
    - Calculate Daily Volatility
      - Use High price
      - Use Low price
    - Smooth Volatility
      - Use Exponential Moving Average
- Sub-Thought: Market Sentiment Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Formula: OBV_t = OBV_{t-1} + (Volume_t * (Close_t > Close_{t-1}))
- Sub-Thought: Volume Spike and Reversal Detection
  - Sub-Thought: Intraday Reversal
    - Formula: (High_t - Open_t) / (High_t - Low_t)
  - Sub-Thought: Intraday Reversal Adjustment
    - Formula: If (Intraday Reversal > 0.5), reduce factor by 20%
- Sub-Thought: Final Alpha Factor Integration
  - Formula: Final Alpha Factor = (Daily Price Momentum * Daily Price Range * Intraday Return * Volume Change * Dollar Volume * VWAP Momentum * (SMA(Close, short_window) - SMA(Close, long_window)) * RSI(Close, window) * MACD * OBV * Intraday Midpoint to Open Ratio * Weighted Sum of Returns * Combined Envelopes * Volatility Factor * Intraday Reversal Adjustment)
