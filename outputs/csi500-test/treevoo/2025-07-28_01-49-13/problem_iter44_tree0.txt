Thought: Synthesize Comprehensive Alpha Factor Using Price, Volume, and Market Dynamics with Trend and Sentiment Analysis
- Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between close prices and moving averages
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
    - Formula: SMA(Close, 7)
  - Sub-thought: Compare the current close price with the 7-day SMA
    - Sub-thought: If Close_t > SMA(Close, 7), indicate a bullish trend
    - Sub-thought: If Close_t < SMA(Close, 7), indicate a bearish trend
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the direction of the 7-day SMA
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the 21-day SMA of close prices
    - Formula: SMA(Close, 21)
  - Sub-thought: Determine if the 7-day SMA is rising or falling compared to the 21-day SMA
    - Sub-thought: If SMA(Close, 7) > SMA(Close, 21), confirm a bullish trend
    - Sub-thought: If SMA(Close, 7) < SMA(Close, 21), confirm a bearish trend
- Sub-thought: Assess the relationship between volume and price changes
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume from the previous day
    - Formula: (Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}) / Volume_{t-1}
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in close price from the previous day
    - Formula: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
  - Sub-thought: Determine if high volume accompanies significant price changes
    - Sub-thought: If (Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}) > 0.2 * Volume_{t-1} and (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) > 0.05 * Close_{t-1}, indicate strong buying pressure
    - Sub-thought: If (Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}) > 0.2 * Volume_{t-1} and (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) < -0.05 * Close_{t-1}, indicate strong selling pressure
- Sub-thought: Analyze price gaps
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the current day's open price and the previous day's close price
    - Formula: Open_t - Close_{t-1}
  - Sub-thought: Categorize the gap as up, down, or no gap
    - Sub-thought: If (Open_t - Close_{t-1}) > 0.02 * Close_{t-1}, indicate an up gap
    - Sub-thought: If (Open_t - Close_{t-1}) < -0.02 * Close_{t-1}, indicate a down gap
    - Sub-thought: If |(Open_t - Close_{t-1})| < 0.02 * Close_{t-1}, indicate no gap
  - Sub-thought: Analyze the significance of the gap
    - Sub-thought: If an up gap occurs, indicate potential continuation of an uptrend
    - Sub-thought: If a down gap occurs, indicate potential continuation of a downtrend
- Sub-thought: Daily Price Momentum
  - Formula: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
- Sub-thought: Daily Price Range
  - Formula: High_t - Low_t
- Sub-thought: Intraday Return Adjusted by High-Low Range
  - Formula: (Close_t - Open_t) / (High_t - Low_t)
- Sub-thought: Volume Change
  - Formula: Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}
- Sub-thought: Dollar Volume
  - Formula: Amount_t * Close_t
- Sub-thought: Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Momentum
  - Formula: (VWAP_t - Open_t) / VWAP_t
- Sub-thought: Moving Averages and Crossovers
  - Formula: SMA(Close, 7) - SMA(Close, 21)
- Sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
  - Formula: OBV_t = OBV_{t-1} + (Volume_t * (Close_t > Close_{t-1}))
- Sub-thought: Intraday Reversal
  - Formula: (High_t - Open_t) / (High_t - Low_t)
- Sub-thought: Intraday Reversal Adjustment
  - Formula: If (Intraday Reversal > 0.5), reduce factor by 20%
- Sub-thought: Final
