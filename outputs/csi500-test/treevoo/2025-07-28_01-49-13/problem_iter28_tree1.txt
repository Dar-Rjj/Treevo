Thought: Explore Price-Based Alpha Factors
- Sub-thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover
    - Sub-thought: Short-term SMA (e.g., 5-day) crossing above long-term SMA (e.g., 20-day)
  - Sub-thought: Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate ROC for close prices over a period (e.g., 14 days)
- Sub-thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Sub-thought: True Range
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the true range as the maximum of (high - low), (high - previous close), (previous close - low)
  - Sub-thought: Average True Range (ATR)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ATR over a period (e.g., 14 days)
- Sub-thought: Volume-Based Alpha Factors
  - Sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate OBV by adding volume on up days and subtracting volume on down days
  - Sub-thought: Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate CMF by summing the money flow multiplier over a period (e.g., 20 days)
- Sub-thought: Support and Resistance Levels
  - Sub-thought: Identify recent high and low as potential support and resistance levels
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the distance between the current price and these levels
- Sub-thought: Gap Analysis
  - Sub-thought: Detect gaps in price movement
    - Sub-thought: Positive gap (today's open is higher than yesterday's high)
    - Sub-thought: Negative gap (today's open is lower than yesterday's low)
- Sub-thought: Intraday Price Movement
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change between open and close
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the intraday range as (high - low)
- Sub-thought: Trend Following
  - Sub-thought: Directional Movement Indicator (DMI)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the positive and negative directional indicators (+DI, -DI)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference (+DI - -DI) to determine trend strength
