- Integrative Analysis of Historical Price and Volume Data for Alpha Generation
  - Analyzing Price Movements and Trends
    - Calculating Daily Return: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
      - Evaluating the Momentum Factor: Sum(daily return over a 30-day window)
      - Evaluating the Mean Reversion Factor: (Close_t - Average(Close over a 30-day window)) / Standard Deviation(Close over a 30-day window)
      - Assessing the Risk-Adjusted Return: Sum(daily return over a 30-day window) / Standard Deviation(daily returns over a 30-day window)
    - Exploring Daily Price Range: (High - Low)
      - Investigating the Relationship Between Daily Price Range and Next Day's Return
    - Analyzing Close to Open Returns: (Close(t) - Open(t)) / Open(t)
      - Studying the Impact of Close-to-Open Returns on Future Stock Performance
  - Examining Volume and Trading Activity
    - Determining Average Volume Over N Days: Mean(Volume, N)
