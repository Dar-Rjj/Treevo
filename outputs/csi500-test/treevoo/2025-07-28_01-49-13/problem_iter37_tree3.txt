Thought: Calculate the difference between today's closing price and the average of the previous 5 days' closing prices to capture short-term momentum.
    Sub-Thought: To adjust for volatility, calculate the standard deviation of the past 5 days' closing prices and divide the above difference by this standard deviation.
    Sub-Thought: Incorporate trading volume into the analysis by computing the ratio of today’s volume to the average volume over the past 5 days. Multiply this ratio by the previously calculated momentum factor to weigh the momentum signal by volume strength.
    Sub-Thought: Consider the directional movement by comparing today's high and low with yesterday's. If today's high is higher than yesterday's high AND today's low is also higher, it indicates a bullish trend. Add a binary (1 or 0) based on this condition to the overall factor to reinforce the momentum signal.
