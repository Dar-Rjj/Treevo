Thought: Explore Momentum and Reversion Factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate simple moving average (SMA) based features
  - Sub-sub-thought: SMA for closing prices over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 days)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compare current close price with the SMAs to determine momentum or reversion signals
- Sub-thought: Develop price rate of change (ROC) indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute ROC for multiple time frames (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 days)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Use ROC to identify accelerating or decelerating trends in stock prices
- Sub-thought: Analyze trading volume patterns
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create a volume-based ROC by calculating the percentage change in daily volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Investigate the relationship between volume ROC and price changes
- Sub-thought: Incorporate open, high, low, and close prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Utilize candlestick patterns (e.g., Doji, Bullish Engulfing, Bearish Engulfing) as short-term trend indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the ratio between the difference of high and low, and the previous close, to gauge volatility
- Sub-thought: Examine amount and volume interaction
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the average transaction size (Amount / Volume) over various lookback periods
  - Sub-sub-thought: Evaluate if shifts in the average transaction size precede significant price movements
