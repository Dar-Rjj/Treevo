Thought: Analyze Price and Volume Patterns for Trend Identification
- Sub-thought: Examine the relationship between close prices and moving averages
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
  - Sub-thought: Compare the current close price with the 7-day SMA
    - Sub-thought: If the close price is above the 7-day SMA, indicate a bullish trend
    - Sub-thought: If the close price is below the 7-day SMA, indicate a bearish trend
- Sub-thought: Investigate the direction of the 7-day SMA
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the 21-day SMA of close prices
  - Sub-thought: Determine if the 7-day SMA is rising or falling compared to the 21-day SMA
    - Sub-thought: If the 7-day SMA is rising, confirm a bullish trend
    - Sub-thought: If the 7-day SMA is falling, confirm a bearish trend

- Sub-thought: Evaluate the relationship between volume and price changes
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume from the previous day
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in close price from the previous day
  - Sub-thought: Determine if high volume accompanies significant price changes
    - Sub-thought: If high volume accompanies a large positive price change, indicate strong buying pressure
    - Sub-thought: If high volume accompanies a large negative price change, indicate strong selling pressure

- Sub-thought: Identify Price Gaps
  - Sub-thought: Detect gaps between consecutive days' prices
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the current day's open price and the previous day's close price
    - Sub-thought: Categorize the gap as up, down, or no gap
      - Sub-thought: If the current open price is significantly higher than the previous close price, indicate an up gap
      - Sub-thought: If the current open price is significantly lower than the previous close price, indicate a down gap
      - Sub-thought: If there is no significant difference, indicate no gap
  - Sub-thought: Analyze the significance of the gap
    - Sub-thought: If an up gap occurs, indicate potential continuation of an uptrend
    - Sub-thought: If a down gap occurs, indicate potential continuation of a downtrend

- Sub-thought: Examine High and Low Prices for Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the range (high - low) for the current day
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the average range over the past 7 days
  - Sub-thought: Compare the current day's range with the average range
    - Sub-thought: If the current day's range is significantly higher than the average range, indicate increased volatility
    - Sub-thought: If the current day's range is significantly lower than the average range, indicate decreased volatility

- Sub-thought: Analyze the Direction of the Close Price Relative to Open
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the close price and the open price
  - Sub-thought: Categorize the day as up, down, or flat
    - Sub-thought: If the close price is higher than the open price, indicate an up day
    - Sub-thought: If the close price is lower than the open price, indicate a down day
    - Sub-thought: If the close price is equal to the open price, indicate a flat day

- Sub-thought: Evaluate the Consistency of Price Movement
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the number of consecutive up or down days
  - Sub-thought: Determine if the market is trending or consolidating
    - Sub-thought: If there are several consecutive up or down days, indicate a trending market
    - Sub-thought: If there are alternating up and down days, indicate a consolidating market
