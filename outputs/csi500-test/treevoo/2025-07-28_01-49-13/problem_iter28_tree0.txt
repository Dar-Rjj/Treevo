- Explore historical price and volume data for unique patterns
  - Analyze open, high, low, close prices for trends
    - Calculate daily return: (close_t - close_{t-1}) / close_{t-1}
      - Evaluate the momentum factor: sum(daily return over a 30-day window)
      - Evaluate the mean reversion factor: (close_t - average(close over a 30-day window)) / standard_deviation(close over a 30-day window)
    - Identify volatility: standard deviation of daily returns over a 30-day window
      - Assess the risk-adjusted return: (sum(daily return over a 30-day window)) / (standard deviation of daily returns over a 30-day window)
  - Examine volume for trading activity
    - Calculate daily volume change: (volume_t - volume_{t-1})
      - Identify significant volume spikes: if (volume_t > 2 * average(volume over a 30-day window))
        - Determine the impact on price: (close_t - close_{t-1}) / close_{t-1} when significant volume spike occurs
