Thought: Synthesize Momentum and Volatility Adjusted by Open-Close Spread and High-Low Range with Volume Weighting
├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Subtract Close price from Open price to get Spread
├── Experiment with Rolling Window Sums of Open-Close Spread
│   └── Create a rolling window sum over the past N days (e.g., 5, 10, 20) to capture short-term trend
├── Calculate Percentage Change in Closing Price
│   ├── Use the percentage change as a measure of daily return
│   └── Create a rolling window standard deviation of daily returns over the past M days (e.g., 10, 30, 60) to assess volatility
├── Analyze Volume-Price Interaction
│   └── Compute the ratio of volume to price change (volume / (close - open)) for each day
│       └── Determine the average of this ratio over the last K days (e.g., 5, 14, 28) to identify patterns in trading activity
├── Investigate Intraday Volatility
│   └── Calculate the average intraday range (high - low) over L days (e.g., 7, 14, 30)
├── Combine Close-Open Difference, Daily Volume, and Interactions
│   └── Formulate a factor that combines the close-open difference, daily volume, and their interaction
│       └── Use a linear or multiplicative combination to see which better captures the market sentiment
├── Evaluate Cumulative Positive vs. Negative Returns
│   └── Count the number of positive and negative returns over the last P days (e.g., 5, 10, 21)
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Momentum
│   ├── Determine Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Compute difference between current close and average close over the lookback period
│       └── Multiply Momentum by the absolute value of the Open-Close Spread
│           └── Divide Adjusted Momentum by the High-Low Range
│               └── Multiply the final adjusted momentum by the daily volume
│                   └── Sum the weighted adjusted momentum over the lookback period
│                       └── Divide the sum by the total volume over the lookback period
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── High-Low Difference (High - Low)
│   ├── Average True Range (ATR) over a lookback period
│   │   ├── Calculate True Range for each day
│   │   └── Sum True Range and divide by lookback period
│   └── Weight Intraday Volatility by Volume
│       ├── Multiply Intraday Volatility by Volume
│       └── Sum the weighted intraday volatility over the lookback period
├── Final Alpha Factor Component 1
│   └── Divide the sum of weighted momentum by the total volume over the lookback period
├── Final Alpha Factor Component 2
│   └── Divide the sum of weighted intraday volatility by the total volume over the lookback period
├── Calculate Price Movement Consistency
│   ├── Determine Lookback Period (e.g., 20 days)
│   ├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices
│   └── Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns
└── Final Alpha Factor Component 3
    └── Divide the standard deviation of daily returns by the EMA of close prices
└── Combine Final Alpha Factors
    └── Add Final Alpha Factor Component 1, Final Alpha Factor Component 2, and Final Alpha Factor Component 3
```
