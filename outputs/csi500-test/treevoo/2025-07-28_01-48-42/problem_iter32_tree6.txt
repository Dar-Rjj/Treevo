│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   ├── Subtract Open from Close to get Spread
├── Calculate Price Change
│   ├── Subtract Close price of previous day from Close price of current day
├── Compute 5-Day Momentum
│   ├── Use Price Change
│   └── Sum over the last 5 days
├── Adjust for Volume and Amount
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Range by Volume
│   └── Multiply High-Low Range by Square Root of Amount
│       ├── Add the two results (Volume-Adjusted and Amount-Adjusted)
├── Adjust Momentum by Open-Close Spread
│   ├── Use calculated 5-Day Momentum
│   └── Multiply by the absolute value of the Daily Open-Close Price Spread
├── Combine Momentum and Volume-Amount-Adjusted Range
│   ├── Divide 5-Day Momentum by the sum of Volume-Adjusted and Amount-Adjusted Range
├── Enhance Combined Signal with Smoothing
│   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the combined signal
│   └── Choose a suitable EMA span, e.g., 5 days for short-term signals
├── Calculate Weighted Price Change
│   ├── Use Price Change
│   └── Multiply by Volume and Square Root of Amount
├── Combine Adjusted Range with Weighted Price Change
│   ├── Add Enhanced Combined Signal to Weighted Price Change
├── Compute Intraday Reversal Score
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Return using High and Low prices
│   └── Invert Intraday Return for Reversal
├── Consider Close-to-Open Price Change
│   ├── Calculate Close-to-Open Difference
│   └── Integrate into Final Factor
│       └── Multiply Volume-Adjusted Reversal with C-O Diff
├── Adjust Momentum by Open-Close Spread (Intraday Reversal)
│   ├── Multiply Weighted Momentum by absolute value of Open-Close Spread
├── Integrate Volume-Amount-Adjusted Range with Weighted Price Change
│   ├── Add to Combined Momentum and Intraday Reversal
├── Calculate Daily Volatility
│   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices
│   └── Use the formula: sqrt((High - Low)^2 / 4 + (Close - Open)^2 / 4)
├── Adjust Intraday Reversal Score by Daily Volatility
│   ├── Multiply Intraday Reversal Score by Daily Volatility
├── Adjust Momentum by Daily Volatility
│   ├── Multiply 5-Day Momentum by Daily Volatility
├── Calculate Daily Return
│   ├── (Close - Open) / Open
├── Calculate Daily Log Return
│   ├── log(Close / Open)
├── Calculate 5-Day Moving Average of Daily Return
│   ├── Use Daily Return
│   └── Calculate 5-Day Moving Average
├── Measure Acceleration of Returns
│   ├── Calculate the difference between the current day's return and its 5-day moving average
│   └── Create a factor that measures the acceleration of returns by computing the difference in the 5-day moving average over consecutive days
├── Calculate Recent Volatility
│   ├── Compute the standard deviation of the past 10 days' daily returns
│   └── Calculate the ratio of the current day's return to the recent volatility
├── Evaluate Volume-Return Relationship
│   ├── Ratio of today’s volume over the average volume of the last 10 days, multiplied by the daily return
│   └── Introduce a threshold for the volume ratio to create a binary indicator when the volume is significantly higher than the average
├── Incorporate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Compute the percentage range as (high - low) / close
│   └── Combine the percentage range with the daily return to form a new factor
│       └── Create a factor that considers the interaction between the percentage range and the 5-day moving average of the daily return
├── Investigate Large Trades
│   ├── Identify days where the volume is above the 90th percentile of the past 30 days
│   └── For those days, flag them and create a binary factor
│       └── Enhance the binary factor by incorporating the direction of the daily return on these flagged days
├── Analyze Opening and Closing Gaps
│   ├── Determine if there is a gap up or down (open - previous close)
│   └── Create a factor based on the magnitude and direction of these gaps, combined with the next day's return
