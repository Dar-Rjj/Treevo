    └── Incorporate Ratio-Based Price Factors
        ├── Calculate the ratio of high to low prices
        │   └── Compute the (high - low) / open as a measure of intraday volatility
        ├── Use (close - open) / (high - low) as an indicator of trend strength
        ├── Calculate the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume over the past 10 days
        │   └── If the ratio is greater than 1, flag it as a high volume day
        │       └── When a high volume day occurs, use (close - open) * (volume / avg_volume) to emphasize significant price movements
        ├── Use the product of the daily return and the relative volume as an indicator of price movement intensity
        ├── Explore Momentum Factors
        │   ├── Consider the difference between the current close and the moving average of closes over the last 20 days
        │   ├── Introduce a factor that calculates the sum of positive and negative returns over the last 50 days separately
        │   │   └── Divide the sum of positive returns by the absolute value of the sum of negative returns for a measure of bullishness
        ├── Analyze Consecutive Days with Similar Price Movements
        │   ├── Count the number of consecutive days where the close was higher than the open
        │   │   └── If the count exceeds a threshold, interpret it as a sign of a potential uptrend
        │   ├── Similarly, count the number of consecutive days where the close was lower than the open
        │   │   └── A high count could indicate a potential downtrend, aiding in reversal or continuation strategy
        ├── Incorporate the Concept of Gaps
        │   ├── Identify if today's open is significantly different from yesterday's close
        │   │   ├── When a gap up occurs (open > previous close), compute the magnitude of the gap and use it as a signal for further price movement
        │   │   └── For a gap down (open < previous close), similarly calculate the gap
