Crossover-Enhanced High-Low Momentum with Volume-Weighted Adjustments and Intraday Reversal
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   └── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Subtract Open price from Close price
├── Calculate Price Change
│   └── Subtract Close price of previous day from Close price of current day
├── Compute 5-Day Momentum
│   └── Sum Price Change over the last 5 days
├── Adjust for Volume and Amount
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Range by Volume
│   └── Multiply High-Low Range by Cube Root of Amount
│       └── Add the two results (Volume-Adjusted and Amount-Adjusted)
├── Adjust 5-Day Momentum by Open-Close Spread
│   └── Multiply 5-Day Momentum by the absolute value of the Daily Open-Close Price Spread
├── Combine Momentum and Volume-Amount-Adjusted Range
│   └── Divide 5-Day Momentum by the sum of Volume-Adjusted and Amount-Adjusted Range
├── Enhance Combined Signal with Smoothing
│   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the combined signal
├── Calculate Weighted Price Change
│   └── Multiply Price Change by Volume and Cube Root of Amount
├── Combine Adjusted Range with Weighted Price Change
│   └── Add Enhanced Combined Signal to Weighted Price Change
├── Compute Intraday Reversal Score
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Return (High price - Low price)
│   └── Invert Intraday Return for Reversal
├── Consider Close-to-Open Price Change
│   └── Calculate Close-to-Open Difference (Close price - Open price)
├── Integrate Volume-Adjusted Reversal with C-O Diff
│   └── Multiply Volume-Adjusted Reversal by C-O Diff
├── Integrate Volume-Amount-Adjusted Range with Weighted Price Change
│   └── Add to Combined Momentum and Intraday Reversal
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average to Daily Close Price Returns (Period: 12 Days)
├── Calculate Volume Spike Factor
│   ├── Calculate Day-to-Day Volume Change
│   │   └── Use Volume (t) and Volume (t-1)
│   └── Indicate Significant Volume Increase
│       ├── If Volume Change > 2 * Median Absolute Deviation of Last 20 Days Volume
│       └── Assign Value: 1 for Increase, 0 for No Increase
├── Final Alpha Factor
│   ├── Multiply Enhanced Combined Signal by Smoothened Momentum
│   ├── Multiply by Volume Spike Factor
│   └── Add to Close-to-Open Price Change
└── Interpretation
    └── Stronger indicator of future return when there is a significant volume spike and high momentum
