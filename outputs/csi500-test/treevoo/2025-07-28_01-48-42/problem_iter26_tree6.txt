Thought: Generate alpha factors using raw OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices, volume, and amount for predicting future stock returns.
    Subthought: Calculate price patterns based on the relationship between Open, High, Low, and Close.
        Subthought: Create a factor measuring the strength of the upward or downward trend using the difference between Close and Open.
            Subthought: If Close > Open, return (Close - Open). If Open > Close, return -(Open - Close).
        Subthought: Identify the presence of a long wick (shadow) by comparing the High-Low range to the body (Close-Open or Open-Close).
            Subthought: If (High - Low) / (Close - Open) > 2, indicate a long upper shadow. If (High - Low) / (Open - Close) > 2, indicate a long lower shadow.
    Subthought: Use trading volume in conjunction with price changes to identify momentum.
        Subthought: Compute a factor that measures the ratio of volume change to price change.
            Subthought: If Volume[t] > Volume[t-1], and (Close[t] - Close[t-1]) > 0, then return (Volume[t] / Volume[t-1]) * (Close[t] - Close[t-1]).
            Subthought: If Volume[t] < Volume[t-1], and (Close[t] - Close[t-1]) < 0, then return (Volume[t] / Volume[t-1]) * (Close[t] - Close[t-1]).
    Subthought: Examine high and low prices for volatility.
        Subthought: Calculate the range (High - Low) as a measure of daily volatility.
            Subthought: Use the range as a factor.
        Subthought: True Range: max(high - low, abs(high - previous close), abs(low - previous close)).
            Subthought: Average True Range (ATR): Moving average of the true range.
                Subthought: 10-day ATR.
                Subthought: 20-day ATR.
    Subthought: Consider the relationship between current and historical volumes.
        Subthought: Develop a factor that compares the current day's volume to the moving average of past volumes.
            Subthought: Moving Average Volume (MAV) = (Sum of Volumes for the last n days) / n.
            Subthought: Volume Momentum Factor = (Volume[t] - MAV) / MAV.
        Subthought: Volume change: (current volume - previous volume) / previous volume.
            Subthought: 5-day moving sum of volume change.
            Subthought: 10-day moving sum of volume change.
    Subthought: Integrate the amount traded as a factor.
        Subthought: Calculate the average amount traded over a period.
            Subthought: Average Amount Traded (AAT) = (Sum of Amounts for the last n days) / n.
        Subthought: Create a factor that measures the deviation of the current day's amount from the average.
            Subthought: Amount Deviation Factor = (Amount[t] - AAT) / AAT.
        Subthought: Calculate the ratio of amount to price (Amount to Price Ratio).
            Subthought: Use the Amount to Price Ratio as a factor.
    Subthought: Analyze the momentum of the stock.
        Subthought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price over a fixed period (e.g., 5 days).
            Subthought: Use the percentage change as a factor.
        Subthought: Explore momentum indicators.
            Subthought: Relative Strength Index (RSI).
                Subthought: 14-day RSI without normalization.
                Subthought: 7-day RSI for short-term trend.
    Subthought: Incorporate the trend of the stock.
        Subthought: Calculate the moving average of the closing price over a short period (e.g., 10 days).
        Subthought: Calculate the moving average of the closing price over a long period (e.g., 50 days).
        Subthought: Determine the difference between the short-term and long-term moving averages (Trend Factor).
            Subthought: Use the Trend Factor as an alpha factor.
    Subthought: Combine factors.
        Subthought: Composite alpha factor: weighted sum of selected individual factors.
            Subthought: Example: 0.5 * 20-day average daily return + 0.3 * 10-day ATR + 0.2 * 14-day RSI.
    Subthought: Backtest and refine.
        Subthought: Evaluate performance of composite alpha factor.
        Subthought: Adjust weights and components based on backtest results.
    Subthought: Examine candlestick patterns.
        Subthought: Doji pattern.
        Subthought: Bullish and Bearish Engulfing.
        Subthought: Hammer and Hanging Man.
    Subthought: Evaluate market sentiment.
        Subthought: High-Low
