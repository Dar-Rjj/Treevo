Thought: Begin by defining basic indicators from the given (open, high, low, close) prices, amount, and volume.
- Sub-thought: Calculate daily return as (close - open) / open
  - Sub-sub-thought: Define a factor for daily log return as log(close / open)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Create a factor that calculates the cumulative log return over the past 5 days
- Sub-thought: Introduce a concept of price momentum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the 10-day moving average of the daily return
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the current day's return and its 10-day moving average
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Create a factor that measures the acceleration of returns by computing the difference in the 10-day moving average over consecutive days
- Sub-thought: Explore the volatility of the stock
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the standard deviation of the past 20 days' daily returns to measure recent volatility
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of the current day's return to the recent volatility
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Introduce a factor that measures the rolling correlation between the daily return and the recent volatility
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the relationship between the closing price and the volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create a factor as the ratio of today’s volume over the average volume of the last 20 days, multiplied by the daily return
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Introduce a threshold for the volume ratio to create a binary indicator when the volume is significantly higher than the average
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Enhance the binary factor by incorporating the direction and magnitude of the daily return on these high-volume days
- Sub-thought: Incorporate the high-low spread into the factor creation
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the percentage range as (high - low) / close
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Combine the percentage range with the daily return to form a new factor
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Create a factor that considers the interaction between the percentage range and the 10-day moving average of the daily return
        - Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Introduce a factor that measures the ratio of the percentage range to the 10-day moving average of the percentage range
- Sub-thought: Investigate the effect of large trades on stock movement
  - Sub-sub-thought: Identify days where the volume is above the 95th percentile of the past 30 days
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: For those days, flag them and create a binary factor
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Enhance the binary factor by incorporating the direction of the daily return on these flagged days
- Sub-thought: Analyze the pattern of the opening and closing gaps
  - Sub-sub-thought: Determine if there is a gap up or down (open - previous close)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Create a factor based on the magnitude and direction of these gaps, combined with the next day's return
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Extend the factor to include the impact of consecutive gaps over a 10-day period
        - Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Introduce a factor that measures the frequency and magnitude of gaps over the past 30 days
