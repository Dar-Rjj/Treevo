Thought: Generate alpha factors using raw OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices and volume for predicting future stock returns.
    Subthought: Calculate price patterns based on the relationship between Open, High, Low, and Close.
        Subthought: Create a factor measuring the strength of the upward or downward trend using the difference between Close and Open.
            Subthought: If Close > Open, return (Close - Open). If Open > Close, return -(Open - Close).
        Subthought: Identify the presence of a long wick (shadow) by comparing the High-Low range to the body (Close-Open or Open-Close).
            Subthought: If (High - Low) / (Close - Open) > 2, indicate a long upper shadow. If (High - Low) / (Open - Close) > 2, indicate a long lower shadow.
    Subthought: Use trading volume in conjunction with price changes to identify momentum.
        Subthought: Compute a factor that measures the ratio of volume change to price change.
            Subthought: If Volume[t] > Volume[t-1], and (Close[t] - Close[t-1]) > 0, then return (Volume[t] / Volume[t-1]) * (Close[t] - Close[t-1]).
            Subthought: If Volume[t] < Volume[t-1], and (Close[t] - Close[t-1]) < 0, then return (Volume[t] / Volume[t-1]) * (Close[t] - Close[t-1]).
    Subthought: Incorporate the concept of volatility into the alpha factor.
        Subthought: Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) over a specified period without normalization.
            Subthought: ATR = (Sum of (High - Low) for n periods) / n.
        Subthought: Use ATR to create a factor that adjusts the impact of price changes based on recent volatility.
            Subthought: Adjusted Price Change Factor = (Close[t] - Close[t-1]) / ATR.
    Subthought: Consider the relationship between current and historical volumes.
        Subthought: Develop a factor that compares the current day's volume to the moving average of past volumes.
            Subthought: Moving Average Volume (MAV) = (Sum of Volumes for the last n days) / n.
            Subthought: Volume Momentum Factor = (Volume[t] - MAV) / MAV.
    Subthought: Integrate the amount traded as a factor.
        Subthought: Calculate the average amount traded over a period.
            Subthought: Average Amount Traded (AAT) = (Sum of Amounts for the last n days) / n.
        Subthought: Create a factor that measures the deviation of the current day's amount from the average.
            Subthought: Amount Deviation Factor = (Amount[t] - AAT) / AAT.
