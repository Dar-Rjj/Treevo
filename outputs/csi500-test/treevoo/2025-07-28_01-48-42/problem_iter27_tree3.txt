Thought: Explore basic price action factors
    Sub-thought: Calculate daily returns
        Sub-thought: Use closing prices to calculate simple returns (close[t] / close[t-1] - 1)
    Sub-thought: Examine high-low range
        Sub-thought: Calculate the daily range (high[t] - low[t])
        Sub-thought: Investigate the ratio of daily range to closing price ( (high[t] - low[t]) / close[t] )
    Sub-thought: Analyze opening and closing gap
        Sub-thought: Measure the gap between open and previous close (open[t] - close[t-1])
        Sub-thought: Investigate the ratio of gap to previous close ( (open[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1] )

Thought: Investigate volume-based factors
    Sub-thought: Calculate daily volume changes
        Sub-thought: Measure the change in volume (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
        Sub-thought: Examine the ratio of volume change to previous volume ( (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) / volume[t-1] )
    Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between volume and price
        Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of volume to daily range (volume[t] / (high[t] - low[t]))
        Sub-thought: Investigate the ratio of volume to absolute return (volume[t] / abs(close[t] / close[t-1] - 1))

Thought: Explore moving average-based factors
    Sub-thought: Calculate simple moving averages
        Sub-thought: Compute 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day simple moving averages of closing prices
        Sub-thought: Investigate the difference between short-term and long-term moving averages (SMA_5[t] - SMA_20[t])
    Sub-thought: Analyze moving average crossovers
        Sub-thought: Identify when a short-term moving average crosses above or below a long-term moving average
        Sub-thought: Measure the distance of the closing price from the moving average (close[t] - SMA_20[t])

Thought: Investigate momentum and trend factors
    Sub-thought: Calculate rate of change
        Sub-thought: Compute the rate of change over various periods (e.g., ROC_5 = (close[t] / close[t-5]) - 1)
        Sub-thought: Compare ROCs over different periods (ROC_5[t] - ROC_10[t])
    Sub-thought: Analyze directional movement
        Sub-thought: Determine the number of up days and down days in a given period
        Sub-thought: Calculate the net difference between up days and down days

Thought: Explore relative strength factors
    Sub-thought: Calculate relative strength against a benchmark
        Sub-thought: Define a benchmark index and compute the relative strength (RS) of the stock compared to the benchmark
        Sub-thought: Investigate the ratio of the stock's return to the benchmark's return (return_stock[t] / return_benchmark[t])
    Sub-thought: Analyze the consistency of outperformance
        Sub-thought: Count the number of days the stock outperformed the benchmark in a given period
        Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage of outperforming days in the period
