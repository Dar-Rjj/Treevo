Thought: Analyze price patterns for predictive signals
- Sub-thought: Calculate the average of (open, high, low, close) over a 5-day window to identify trend direction
- Sub-thought: Compute daily price change (close - open) as a measure of intraday volatility
  - Sub-sub-thought: Sum the daily price changes over a 10-day window to capture short-term momentum
- Sub-thought: Determine the ratio of high to low prices to gauge market sentiment
  - Sub-sub-thought: Track the moving average of the high-to-low ratio over 20 days to smooth out noise and highlight sustained trends
- Sub-thought: Use the volume to detect significant trading activity
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume from the previous day to identify sudden interest or disinterest in the stock
- Sub-thought: Examine the relationship between amount and volume to assess the strength of the transaction
  - Sub-sub-thought: Measure the difference between the current day's amount and the 5-day moving average of amounts to spot unusual activity
- Sub-thought: Investigate the impact of gaps (difference between today's open and yesterday's close) on future returns
  - Sub-sub-thought: Categorize days into positive, negative, or no gap and analyze their respective effects on the next day's close
  - Sub-sub-thought: Integrate the gap size with the 10-day price change to refine the signal
- Sub-thought: Combine the high-to-low ratio with the 5-day moving average of the price to formulate a composite indicator
  - Sub-sub-thought: Adjust the composite by multiplying it with the 20-day smoothed high-to-low ratio for a more nuanced view
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the consistency of the 5-day and 10-day price change indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Develop a score based on the number of matching signs (positive or negative) between the two measures over the past 30 days
- Sub-thought: Utilize the interaction between daily price change and volume to predict price movements
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create a joint indicator that weighs the daily price change by the volume percentage change
  - Sub-sub-thought: Apply a simple threshold to the joint indicator to generate a buy/sell signal
