- Begin with base financial data: open, high, low, close, amount, and volume
  - Calculate daily price changes
    - Daily return: (close - open) / open
      - Consider average daily return over a window
        - 5-day average daily return
        - 10-day average daily return
        - 20-day average daily return
      - Explore momentum indicators
        - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
          - 14-day RSI without normalization
          - 7-day RSI for short-term trend
  - Analyze daily volatility
    - True Range: max(high - low, abs(high - previous close), abs(low - previous close))
      - Average True Range (ATR): Moving average of the true range
        - 10-day ATR
        - 20-day ATR
  - Consider volume-based factors
    - Volume change: (current volume - previous volume) / previous volume
      - 5-day moving sum of volume change
      - 10-day moving sum of volume change
    - Volume weighted average price (VWAP)
      - Daily VWAP: (volume * (high + low + close) / 3) / total_volume
  - Investigate money flow and accumulation/distribution
    - Money Flow Index (MFI)
      - 14-day MFI without normalization
  - Examine candlestick patterns
    - Doji pattern
    - Bullish and Bearish Engulfing
    - Hammer and Hanging Man
  - Evaluate market sentiment
    - High-Low difference
      - 5-day moving average of high-low difference
      - 10-day moving average of high-low difference
  - Combine factors
    - Composite alpha factor: weighted sum of selected individual factors
      - Example: 0.5 * 20-day average daily return + 0.3 * 10-day ATR + 0.2 * 14-day RSI
  - Backtest and refine
    - Evaluate performance of composite alpha factor
    - Adjust weights and components based on backtest results
