Volume-Weighted Average Momentum Adjusted by Open-Close Spread and Volume Volatility
├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Subtract Close price from Open price to get Spread
├── Calculate Momentum
│   ├── Determine Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Compute difference between current and average close
├── Adjust Momentum by Absolute Daily Open-Close Spread
│   └── Multiply Momentum by the ratio of Absolute Daily Open-Close Spread to its mean over lookback period
├── Calculate Volume Volatility
│   ├── Determine Lookback Period (e.g., 30 days)
│   └── Compute standard deviation of volume over lookback period
├── Adjust Adjusted Momentum by Volume Volatility
│   └── Divide Adjusted Momentum by Volume Volatility
└── Weight Final Adjusted Momentum by Volume
