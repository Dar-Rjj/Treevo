├── Enhance Combined Signal with Smoothing
│   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the combined signal
│   └── Choose a suitable EMA span, e.g., 5 days for short-term signals
├── Calculate Weighted Price Change
│   ├── Use Price Change
│   └── Multiply by Volume and Square Root of Amount
├── Combine Adjusted Range with Weighted Price Change

├── Integrate Volume-Adjusted Reversal with C-O Diff
│   ├── Calculate Close-to-Open Difference
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Use Open price
│   └── Multiply Volume-Adjusted Reversal with C-O Diff
├── Generate Factor Value
│   ├── Multiply 10-Day High-Low Price Momentum by 10-Day Volume Moving Average
│   └── Divide by Close price
├── Apply a Smoothing Filter to the Combined Signal
│   ├── Use Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the result
│   │   └── E.g., 5 days for short-term signals
├── Introduce a New Volatility Component
│   ├── Calculate Daily Volatility
│   │   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices
│   │   └── Use the formula: sqrt((High - Low)^2 / 4 + (Close - Open)^2 / 4)
│   └── Integrate Volatility into the Final Factor
│       └── Multiply the final factor by the daily volatility
├── Apply a Second Smoothing Layer
│   ├── Use a Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the result
│   │   └── E.g., 10 days for medium-term signals
├── Combine All Factors
