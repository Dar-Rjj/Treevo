    - Thought: OBV = OBV_(t-1) + 
                 (if Close_t > Close_(t-1), then Volume_t,
                  if Close_t < Close_(t-1), then -Volume_t,
                  otherwise, 0)
- Sub-thought: Generate pattern-based indicators

  - Thought: Inside bar pattern
    - Thought: (High_t < High_(t-1) and Low_t > Low_(t-1))
  - Thought: Price and volume confirmation
    - Thought: If (Close_t > Close_(t-1) and Volume_t > Volume_(t-1)), then 1, else 0
