Thought: Analyze price and volume data to generate alpha factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate price-based indicators
  - Sub-thought: Use moving averages
    - Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) over 20 days
    - Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over 10 days
  - Sub-thought: Use price differences
    - Thought: Daily price change (Close_t - Close_(t-1))
    - Thought: High-Low spread (High_t - Low_t)
  - Sub-thought: Use price ratios
    - Thought: Close/Open ratio (Close_t / Open_t)
    - Thought: Close/Previous Close ratio (Close_t / Close_(t-1))
- Sub-thought: Calculate volume-based indicators
  - Thought: Volume trend
    - Thought: Volume change (Volume_t - Volume_(t-1))
  - Thought: Volume-to-price relationship
    - Thought: Volume-weighted close (Sum(Close_i * Volume_i) / Sum(Volume_i) for i in range(t-9, t+1))
- Sub-thought: Combine price and volume indicators
  - Thought: Price-Volume Trend (PVT)
    - Thought: PVT = PVT_(t-1) + (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) * Volume_t
  - Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Thought: OBV = OBV_(t-1) + 
                 (if Close_t > Close_(t-1), then Volume_t,
                  if Close_t < Close_(t-1), then -Volume_t,
                  otherwise, 0)
- Sub-thought: Generate pattern-based indicators
  - Thought: Three-day price pattern
    - Thought: (Close_t - Open_t) + (Close_(t-1) - Open_(t-1)) + (Close_(t-2) - Open_(t-2))
  - Thought: Inside bar pattern
    - Thought: (High_t < High_(t-1) and Low_t > Low_(t-1))
- Sub-thought: Incorporate additional price and volume relationships
  - Thought: Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL)
    - Thought: ADL = ADL_(t-1) + ((Close_t - Low_t) - (High_t - Close_t)) / (High_t - Low_t) * Volume_t
  - Thought: Chaikin Oscillator
    - Thought: Chaikin Oscillator = 3-day EMA of ADL - 10-day EMA of ADL
- Sub-thought: Enhance with more complex patterns
  - Thought: Bullish Engulfing Pattern
    - Thought: (Close_t > Open_t and Close_(t-1) < Open_(t-1) and Close_t > Open_(t-1) and Open_t < Close_(t-1))
  - Thought: Bearish Engulfing Pattern
    - Thought: (Close_t < Open_t and Close_(t-1) > Open_(t-1) and Close_t < Open_(t-1) and Open_t > Close_(t-1))
- Sub-thought: Evaluate momentum and volatility
  - Thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI) over 14 days
    - Thought: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Average Gain / Average Loss)))
  - Thought: Bollinger Bands
    - Thought: Middle Band = SMA(Close, 20)
    - Thought: Upper Band = Middle Band + 2 * StdDev(Close, 20)
    - Thought: Lower Band = Middle Band - 2 * StdDev(Close, 20)
- Sub-thought: Integrate trading signals
  - Thought: Buy signal
    - Thought: RSI < 30 and Close_t crosses above the SMA(20)
  - Thought: Sell signal
    - Thought: RSI > 70 and Close_t crosses below the SMA(20)
