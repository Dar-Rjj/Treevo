Thought: Exploring Price Patterns for Alpha Generation
- Sub-thought: Analyzing the relationship between open and close prices
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between open and close prices (OC_diff)
    - Sub-thought: Compute the moving average of OC_diff over N days (MA_OC_diff)
  - Sub-thought: Investigate the trend of high and low prices
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the range of daily price movement (High - Low)
      - Sub-thought: Compute the moving average of the range over M days (MA_range)
- Sub-thought: Volume Analysis
  - Sub-thought: Examine the relationship between volume and price changes
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of volume to price change (Volume / (Close - Open))
      - Sub-thought: Compute the moving average of this ratio over K days (MA_vol_price_ratio)
  - Sub-thought: Identify significant volume spikes
    - Sub-thought: Determine the percentage increase in volume compared to the previous day
      - Sub-thought: Create a binary indicator for significant volume spikes (1 if spike, 0 otherwise)
- Sub-thought: Incorporating Amount Data
  - Sub-thought: Explore the relationship between amount and price changes
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of amount to price change (Amount / (Close - Open))
      - Sub-thought: Compute the moving average of this ratio over L days (MA_amt_price_ratio)
  - Sub-thought: Analyze the consistency of amount
    - Sub-thought: Compute the standard deviation of the amount over P days (Std_Amount)

- Sub-thought: Interpreting Moving Averages
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average of closing prices over U days (SMA_close_U)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the exponential moving average of closing prices over V days (EMA_close_V)
    - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between EMA_close_V and SMA_close_U (EMA_SMA_diff)
- Sub-thought: Combining Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Create a composite score by combining multiple indicators
    - Sub-thought: Assign weights to each indicator based on historical performance
