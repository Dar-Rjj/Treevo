Thought: Calculate the difference between closing price and opening price for potential momentum signal
  - Sub-Thought: Use the difference to create a rolling window sum over the past N days to capture short-term trend
    - Sub-Thought: Experiment with different values of N (e.g., 5, 10, 20) to find the most effective period
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price from the previous day as a measure of daily return
    - Sub-Thought: Create a rolling window standard deviation of daily returns over the past M days to assess volatility
      - Sub-Thought: Adjust M (e.g., 10, 30, 60) to understand the impact of different time horizons on volatility
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze the relationship between volume and price changes
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the ratio of volume to price change (volume / (close - open)) for each day
      - Sub-Thought: Determine the average of this ratio over the last K days to identify patterns in trading activity
        - Sub-Thought: Vary K (e.g., 5, 14, 28) to explore short, medium, and long-term trends
  - Sub-Thought: Investigate the gap between high and low prices as a measure of intraday volatility
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the average intraday range (high - low) over L days
      - Sub-Thought: Test different lengths of L (e.g., 7, 14, 30) to gauge the persistence of intraday volatility
  - Sub-Thought: Consider the interaction between closing and opening prices and volume
    - Sub-Thought: Formulate a factor that combines the close-open difference, daily volume, and their interaction
      - Sub-Thought: Use a linear or multiplicative combination to see which better captures the market sentiment
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the cumulative effect of positive versus negative daily returns
    - Sub-Thought: Count the number of positive and negative returns over the last P days
      - Sub-Thought: Set different values for P (e.g., 5, 10, 21) to observe if the market is trending up or down
