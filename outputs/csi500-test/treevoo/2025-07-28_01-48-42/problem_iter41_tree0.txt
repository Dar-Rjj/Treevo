Thought: Develop Alpha Factors Based on Historical Price and Volume Data
- Sub-Thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    - Calculate the 50-day and 200-day SMA of closing prices.
    - Generate alpha factor: (SMA_50 - SMA_200) / SMA_200
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Calculate the RSI based on the last 14 days of closing prices.
    - Generate alpha factor: RSI
- Sub-Thought: Volume-Based Indicators
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Calculate the OBV using daily volume and closing prices.
    - Generate alpha factor: OBV
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Calculate the CMF over a 20-day period.
    - Generate alpha factor: CMF
- Sub-Thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Average True Range (ATR)
    - Calculate the ATR over a 14-day period using high, low, and close prices.
    - Generate alpha factor: ATR
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Bollinger Bands
    - Calculate the 20-day SMA and 2 standard deviations of the closing prices.
    - Generate alpha factor: (Close - Lower_Bollinger_Band) / (Upper_Bollinger_Band - Lower_Bollinger_Band)
- Sub-Thought: Price Pattern Indicators
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Engulfing Patterns
    - Identify bullish and bearish engulfing patterns in the candlestick chart.
    - Generate alpha factor: Indicator of whether an engulfing pattern is present
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Doji Patterns
    - Identify doji patterns in the candlestick chart.
    - Generate alpha factor: Indicator of whether a doji pattern is present
- Sub-Thought: Combined Indicators
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Momentum and Volume
    - Combine the momentum (SMA crossover) and volume (OBV) factors.
    - Generate alpha factor: (SMA_50 - SMA_200) / SMA_200 * OBV
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Volatility and Price Patterns
    - Combine the volatility (ATR) and price pattern (engulfing patterns) factors.
    - Generate alpha factor: ATR * Indicator_of_engulfing_pattern
