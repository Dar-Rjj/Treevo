Volume-Weighted Momentum Adjusted by Open-Close Spread and Daily Returns
├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Subtract Close price from Open price to get Spread (open[t] - close[t])
├── Calculate Momentum
│   ├── Determine Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Compute difference between current and average close (close[t] - mean(close[t-lookback:t-1]))
├── Adjust Momentum by Absolute Daily Open-Close Spread
│   └── Multiply Momentum by the inverse of the absolute Open-Close Spread (Momentum * (1 / abs(open[t] - close[t])))
├── Weight Adjusted Momentum by Volume
│   └── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Volume (Adjusted Momentum * volume[t])
├── Calculate daily returns and volume changes
│   ├── Use closing prices to calculate simple returns (return[t] = close[t] / close[t-1] - 1)
│   ├── Measure the change in volume (volume_change[t] = volume[t] - volume[t-1])
│   └── Examine the ratio of volume change to previous volume (volume_ratio[t] = (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) / volume[t-1])
├── Analyze high-low range and intraday volatility
│   ├── Calculate the daily range (daily_range[t] = high[t] - low[t])
│   ├── Investigate the ratio of daily range to closing price (range_to_close_ratio[t] = (high[t] - low[t]) / close[t])
│   ├── Calculate True Range for each day
│   │   └── Max(|high[t] - low[t]|, |high[t] - close[t-1]|, |low[t] - close[t-1]|)
│   └── Sum True Range and divide by lookback period to get Average True Range (ATR) (sum(True_Range[t-lookback:t]) / lookback)
├── Examine opening and closing gaps
│   ├── Measure the gap between open and previous close (gap_open_close[t] = open[t] - close[t-1])
│   ├── Investigate the ratio of gap to previous close (gap_ratio[t] = (open[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1])
│   └── Calculate the closing gap (gap_close_open[t] = close[t] - open[t])
├── Analyze moving averages and trend-following indicators
│   ├── Compute 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day simple moving averages of closing prices
│   │   └── SMA_5[t] = mean(close[t-4:t]), SMA_10[t] = mean(close[t-9:t]), SMA_20[t] = mean(close[t-19:t])
│   ├── Investigate the difference between short-term and long-term moving averages (SMA_diff[t] = SMA_5[t] - SMA_20[t])
│   └── Identify when a short-term moving average crosses above or below a long-term moving average
├── Explore momentum and rate of change
│   ├── Compute the rate of change over various periods (e.g., ROC_5 = (close[t] / close[t-5]) - 1)
│   ├── Compare ROCs over different periods (ROC_difference[t] = ROC_5[t] - ROC_10[t])
│   └── Sum daily returns over the lookback period to get cumulative return (cumulative_return[t] = sum(return[t-lookback:t]))
├── Investigate relative strength and outperformance
│   ├── Define a benchmark index and compute the relative strength (RS) of the stock compared to the benchmark
│   └── Investigate the ratio of the stock's return to the benchmark's return (relative_strength[t] = return_stock[t] / return_benchmark[t])
└── Analyze the relationship between volume and price
    ├── Calculate the ratio of volume to daily range (volume_to_range_ratio[t] = volume[t] / (high[t] - low[t]))
    └── Investigate the ratio of volume to absolute return (volume_to_return_ratio[t] = volume[t] / abs(close[t] / close[t-1] - 1))
