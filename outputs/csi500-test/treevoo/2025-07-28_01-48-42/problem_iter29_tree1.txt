Thought: Crossover of Volume-Weighted Momentum Adjusted by Open-Close Spread and Comprehensive Indicator Analysis
├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Subtract Close price from Open price to get Spread
├── Calculate Momentum
│   ├── Determine Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Compute difference between current and average close
├── Adjust Momentum by Absolute Daily Open-Close Spread
├── Weight Adjusted Momentum by Volume
├── Calculate daily return as (close - open) / open
│   └── Define a factor for daily log return as log(close / open)
├── Introduce a concept of price momentum
│   └── Compute the 5-day moving average of the daily return
│       └── Calculate the difference between the current day's return and its 5-day moving average
├── Explore the volatility of the stock
│   └── Compute the standard deviation of the past 10 days' daily returns to measure recent volatility
├── Evaluate the relationship between the closing price and the volume
│   └── Create a factor as the ratio of today’s volume over the average volume of the last 10 days, multiplied by the daily return
├── Incorporate the high-low spread into the factor creation
│   └── Compute the percentage range as (high - low) / close
│       └── Combine the percentage range with the daily return to form a new factor
├── Investigate the effect of large trades on stock movement
│   └── Identify days where the volume is above the 90th percentile of the past 30 days
│       └── For those days, flag them and create a binary factor
└── Analyze the pattern of the opening and closing gaps
    └── Determine if there is a gap up or down (open - previous close)
        └── Create a factor based on the magnitude and direction of these gaps, combined with the next day's return
```
