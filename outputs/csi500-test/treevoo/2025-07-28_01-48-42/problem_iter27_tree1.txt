Thought: Constructing Alpha Factors Based on Volume and Price Movements
- Thought: Utilize Volume for Market Sentiment
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of closing price to average volume over the past n days
    - Detail: (close / mean(volume, n_days))
  - Sub-thought: Measure the change in volume compared to the previous day
    - Detail: (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
- Thought: Analyze Price Dynamics
  - Sub-thought: Compute the percentage change in closing price from the previous day
    - Detail: ((close[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1]) * 100
  - Sub-thought: Determine the upper shadow length as an indicator of resistance
    - Detail: (high - max(open, close))
  - Sub-thought: Determine the lower shadow length as an indicator of support
    - Detail: (min(open, close) - low)
- Thought: Incorporate High and Low Prices
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the high and low prices
    - Detail: (high - low)
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the true range, which is the maximum of three values
    - Detail: max(high - low, abs(high - close[t-1]), abs(low - close[t-1]))
- Thought: Integrate Multiple Price and Volume Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Create a composite factor by combining the daily return with the volume change
    - Detail: (((close[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1]) * 100) + (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
  - Sub-thought: Formulate a new factor using the upper shadow, lower shadow, and volume
    - Detail: (upper_shadow + lower_shadow) / volume
- Thought: Explore Momentum and Reversal Signals
  - Sub-thought: Develop a momentum factor based on the average of the past m days' returns
    - Detail: mean(((close - close.shift(1)) / close.shift(1)) * 100, m_days)
  - Sub-thought: Design a reversal signal by identifying days where the stock closes below its opening
    - Detail: (open - close) > 0 ? 1 : 0
