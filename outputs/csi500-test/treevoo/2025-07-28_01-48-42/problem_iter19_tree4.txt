Thought: Calculate the daily return and its relationship with trading volume
- Subthought: Compute the daily return as (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t
  - Subthought: Investigate the sign of the daily return to assess market sentiment
- Subthought: Analyze the trading volume relative to the average past N days' volumes
  - Subthought: Compare today's volume to the simple moving average volume over the last N days
    - Subthought: If today's volume is above the SMA, it may indicate a strong market action in the direction of the return

Thought: Explore the relationship between high/low prices and close/open prices
- Subthought: Calculate the intraday range as High_t - Low_t
  - Subthought: Consider the ratio of the closing price to the intraday range for insight into where the stock closed within the day's range
    - Subthought: Higher ratios suggest the stock closed near the day's high, potentially indicating positive momentum
- Subthought: Calculate the gap between the open and previous close
  - Subthought: Positive gaps (Open_t - Close_{t-1}) might signal bullishness, while negative gaps could be bearish

Thought: Examine patterns in the sequence of daily highs and lows
- Subthought: Track the number of consecutive days where the high exceeds the previous day's high
  - Subthought: A streak of increasing highs could be a sign of an uptrend
- Subthought: Similarly, count the number of days where the low is below the prior day's low
  - Subthought: A sequence of lower lows can indicate a downtrend

Thought: Develop alpha factors based on price and volume trend consistency
- Subthought: Measure the slope of a linear fit to the close prices over the recent M days
  - Subthought: Use the slope as a measure of the strength and direction of the trend
- Subthought: Evaluate the correlation between the last L days' returns and their respective volumes
  - Subthought: Positive correlation may suggest that volume is confirming the trend, while a negative correlation could indicate divergence
