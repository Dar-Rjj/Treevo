Performing alpha mining to generate novel, interpretable factors for predicting future stock returns
- Utilize price and volume data
  - Calculate momentum indicators
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA) ratio: Short-term SMA / Long-term SMA of closing prices
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) ratio: Short-term EMA / Long-term EMA of closing prices
    - Rate of Change (ROC) of closing prices
  - Calculate trend indicators
    - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
      - MACD line: 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA of closing prices
      - Signal line: 9-period EMA of MACD line
      - MACD histogram: MACD line - Signal line
    - Directional Movement Index (ADX)
      - ADX: 14-period EMA of DX
        - DX: 100 * |+DI - -DI| / (+DI + -DI)
        - +DI: 14-period EMA of the difference between current high and previous high
        - -DI: 14-period EMA of the difference between previous low and current low
  - Calculate volatility indicators
    - Average True Range (ATR): 14-period EMA of TR
      - TR: max(current high - current low, abs(current high - previous close), abs(current low - previous close))
  - Calculate volume-based indicators
    - On-Balance Volume (OBV): Adjusted by the relationship between the current close and the previous close
    - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF): 20-period sum of (close - low) - (high - close) / (high - low) * volume / 20-period sum of volume
  - Integrate multiple indicators
    - Composite Momentum Indicator (CMI): Combination of SMA ratio, EMA ratio, and ROC
    - Composite Trend Indicator (CTI): Combination of MACD and ADX
    - Composite Volatility Indicator (CVI): ATR
    - Composite Volume Indicator (CVoI): Combination of OBV and CMF
  - Generate final alpha factor
    - Final Alpha Factor (FAF): Weighted sum of CMI, CTI, CVI, and CVoI
