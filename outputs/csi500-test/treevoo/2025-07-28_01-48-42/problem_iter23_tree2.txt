Develop Price and Volume Based Alpha Factors
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Compute (High - Low) / Open as a measure of intraday volatility
│   └── Use (Close - Open) / (High - Low) as an indicator of trend strength
├── Adjust for Volume
│   ├── Calculate the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume over the past 10 days
│   │   └── If the ratio is greater than 1, flag it as a high volume day
│   │       └── When a high volume day occurs, use (Close - Open) * (Volume / Avg_Volume) to emphasize significant price movements
│   └── Use the product of the daily return and the relative volume as an indicator of price movement intensity
├── Explore Momentum Factors
│   ├── Consider the difference between the current close and the moving average of closes over the last 20 days
│   └── Introduce a factor that calculates the sum of positive and negative returns over the last 50 days separately
│       └── Divide the sum of positive returns by the absolute value of the sum of negative returns for a measure of bullishness
├── Analyze Consecutive Price Movements
│   ├── Count the number of consecutive days where the close was higher than the open
│   │   └── If the count exceeds a threshold, interpret it as a sign of a potential uptrend
│   └── Similarly, count the number of consecutive days where the close was lower than the open
│       └── A high count could indicate a potential downtrend, aiding in reversal or continuation strategy
├── Incorporate Gaps
│   ├── Identify if today's open is significantly different from yesterday's close
│   │   ├── When a gap up occurs (Open > Previous Close), compute the magnitude of the gap
│   │   └── For a gap down (Open < Previous Close), similarly calculate the gap size for a downward momentum signal
├── Utilize Price-Volume Relationship
│   ├── Examine whether high volume days are associated with large price changes
│   └── Create a factor that measures the consistency of this relationship, perhaps by calculating the correlation between percentage change in price and volume
├── Investigate Market Breadth
│   ├── Measure the proportion of days within a period where the stock outperforms the index
│   └── This can be used as a factor to identify stocks showing strength relative to the broader market
├── Synthesize Volume-Weighted Intraday Reversal and Momentum
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Range using High and Low prices
│   ├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   │   └── Subtract Close price from Open price to get Spread
│   ├── Adjust Momentum by Absolute Daily Open-Close Spread
│   │   ├── Determine Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   │   └── Compute difference between current and average close
│   │   └── Multiply by absolute value of Open-Close Spread
│   ├── Weight Adjusted Momentum by Volume
│   │   └── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Volume
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Return Volatility
│   │   ├── Compute Intraday Returns using High and Low prices
│   │   └── Compute Standard Deviation over past 10 days
│   ├── Compute Intraday Reversal Score
│   │   ├── Calculate Intraday Return using High and Low prices
│   │   └── Invert Intraday Return for Reversal
│   ├── Adjust for Volume
│   │   └── Multiply by High-Low Range
│   ├── Combine Momentum, Intraday Reversal, and Volume-Adjusted Range
│   │   ├── Compute the difference between current and previous High-Low Ranges
│   │   └── Combine with Intraday Reversal Score
│   │   └── Multiply by Intraday Reversal Score
│   │   └── Add to Combined Momentum and Intraday Reversal
│   ├── Consider Close-to-Open Price Change
│   │   ├── Calculate Close-to-Open Difference
│   │   └── Integrate into Final Factor
│   │   └── Multiply Volume-Adjusted Reversal with C-O Diff
│   ├── Generate Factor Value
│   │   ├── Multiply 10-Day High-Low Price Momentum by 10-Day Volume Moving Average
│   │   └── Divide by Close price
│   ├── Enhance Combined Signal with Smoothing
│   │   └── Apply EMA with span 5 days
│   └── Combine All Factors
│       ├── Weighted Sum
