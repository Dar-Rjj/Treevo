Volume-Weighted Momentum and Intraday Volatility Adjusted by Open-Close Spread and High-Low Range
├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Subtract Close price from Open price to get Spread
├── Calculate Momentum
│   ├── Determine Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Compute difference between current close and average close over the lookback period
├── Adjust Momentum by Absolute Daily Open-Close Spread
│   └── Multiply Momentum by the absolute value of the Open-Close Spread
├── Calculate Daily High-Low Range
│   └── Subtract Low price from High price to get Range
├── Further Adjust Momentum by High-Low Range
│   └── Divide Adjusted Momentum by the High-Low Range
├── Weight Final Adjusted Momentum by Volume
│   └── Multiply the final adjusted momentum by the daily volume
├── Final Alpha Factor Component 1
│   └── Sum the weighted adjusted momentum over the lookback period
│       └── Divide the sum by the total volume over the lookback period
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── High-Low Difference (High - Low)
│   ├── Average True Range (ATR) over a lookback period
│   │   ├── Calculate True Range for each day
│   │   └── Sum True Range and divide by lookback period
│   └── Weight Intraday Volatility by Volume
│       ├── Multiply Intraday Volatility by Volume
│       └── Sum the weighted intraday volatility over the lookback period
├── Final Alpha Factor Component 2
│   └── Divide the sum of weighted intraday volatility by the total volume over the lookback period
├── Calculate Price Movement Consistency
│   ├── Determine Lookback Period (e.g., 20 days)
│   ├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices
│   └── Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns
├── Final Alpha Factor Component 3
│   └── Divide the standard deviation of daily returns by the EMA of close prices
└── Combine Final Alpha Factors
    └── Add Final Alpha Factor Component 1, Final Alpha Factor Component 2, and Final Alpha Factor Component 3
