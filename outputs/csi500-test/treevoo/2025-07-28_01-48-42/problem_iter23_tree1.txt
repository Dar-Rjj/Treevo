Thought: Synthesize price patterns and financial data analysis for alpha factor generation
- Sub-thought: Calculate intraday movement and daily return
  - Sub-thought: Use the difference between close and open prices as a factor (Intraday Movement)
  - Sub-thought: Daily return: (close - open) / open
    - Sub-thought: 5-day average daily return
    - Sub-thought: 10-day average daily return
    - Sub-thought: 20-day average daily return
- Sub-thought: Examine high and low prices for volatility
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the range (High - Low) as a measure of daily volatility
    - Sub-thought: Use the range as a factor
  - Sub-thought: True Range: max(high - low, abs(high - previous close), abs(low - previous close))
    - Sub-thought: 10-day Average True Range (ATR)
    - Sub-thought: 20-day Average True Range (ATR)
- Sub-thought: Consider the relationship between volume and price movement
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of volume to price change (Volume to Price Ratio)
    - Sub-thought: Use the Volume to Price Ratio as a factor
  - Sub-thought: Volume change: (current volume - previous volume) / previous volume
    - Sub-thought: 5-day moving sum of volume change
    - Sub-thought: 10-day moving sum of volume change
- Sub-thought: Investigate the interaction between amount and price
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of amount to price (Amount to Price Ratio)
    - Sub-thought: Use the Amount to Price Ratio as a factor
  - Sub-thought: Volume weighted average price (VWAP)
    - Sub-thought: Daily VWAP: (volume * (high + low + close) / 3) / total_volume
- Sub-thought: Analyze momentum and trend
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price over a fixed period (e.g., 5 days)
    - Sub-thought: Use the percentage change as a factor
  - Sub-thought: Explore momentum indicators
    - Sub-thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
      - Sub-thought: 14-day RSI without normalization
      - Sub-thought: 7-day RSI for short-term trend
  - Sub-thought: Incorporate the trend of the stock
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the moving average of the closing price over a short period (e.g., 10 days)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the moving average of the closing price over a long period (e.g., 50 days)
    - Sub-thought: Determine the difference between the short-term and long-term moving averages (Trend Factor)
      - Sub-thought: Use the Trend Factor as an alpha factor
- Sub-thought: Examine candlestick patterns
  - Sub-thought: Doji pattern
  - Sub-thought: Bullish and Bearish Engulfing
  - Sub-thought: Hammer and Hanging Man
- Sub-thought: Evaluate market sentiment
  - Sub-thought: High-Low difference
    - Sub-thought: 5-day moving average of high-low difference
    - Sub-thought: 10-day moving average of high-low difference
- Sub-thought: Combine factors
  - Sub-thought: Composite alpha factor: weighted sum of selected individual factors
    - Sub-thought: Example: 0.5 * 20-day average daily return + 0.3 * 10-day ATR + 0.2 * 14-day RSI
- Sub-thought: Backtest and refine
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate performance of composite alpha factor
  - Sub-thought: Adjust weights and components based on backtest results
