Thought: Explore price and volume patterns
- Sub-thought: Analyze price movement
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate price change over different time horizons
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute daily price change (close[t] - close[t-1])
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute weekly price change (close[t] - close[t-7])
  - Sub-sub-thought: Identify trend direction
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Determine if the price is in an uptrend or downtrend
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Use moving averages to identify trends
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Calculate 50-day moving average
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Calculate 200-day moving average
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Determine if 50-day MA > 200-day MA
- Sub-thought: Analyze trading volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate volume changes over different time horizons
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute daily volume change (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute weekly volume change (volume[t] - volume[t-7])
  - Sub-sub-thought: Identify volume spikes
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Detect if volume on day t is significantly higher than average volume
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Calculate average volume over the past 30 days
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Compare day t volume with the 30-day average
- Sub-thought: Combine price and volume information
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create a price-volume momentum factor
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Multiply daily price change by daily volume change
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Sum the product over a rolling window
  - Sub-sub-thought: Develop a price-volume breakout signal
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Identify days where both price and volume exceed a threshold
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Define a price threshold (e.g., 2% increase)
      - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Define a volume threshold (e.g., 1.5 times the 30-day average)
- Sub-thought: Incorporate high and low prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate range-related factors
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute the daily price range (high[t] - low[t])
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute the average true range (ATR) over a rolling window
  - Sub-sub-thought: Analyze gaps
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Identify up gaps (open[t] > close[t-1])
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Identify down gaps (open[t] < close[t-1])
- Sub-thought: Consider transaction amount
  - Sub-sub-thought: Analyze transaction amount changes
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute daily amount change (amount[t] - amount[t-1])
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute weekly amount change (amount[t] - amount[t-7])
  - Sub-sub-thought: Develop a transaction amount-based factor
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Create a ratio of daily amount change to daily volume change
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Use this ratio to identify days with significant amount changes
- Sub-thought: Evaluate market sentiment
  - Sub-sub-thought: Use open, close, high, and low prices to gauge sentiment
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute the ratio of close to open (close[t] / open[t])
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Compute the ratio of high to low (high[t] / low[t])
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create a sentiment score
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Assign positive scores for close > open and high > low
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Assign negative scores for close < open and low > high
- Sub-thought: Integrate factors into a composite alpha
  - Sub-sub-thought: Weight individual factors
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Assign weights based on historical performance
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Combine weighted factors into a single alpha score
  - Sub-sub-thought: Test the composite alpha
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Backtest the alpha score against future returns
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Evaluate the statistical significance of the results
