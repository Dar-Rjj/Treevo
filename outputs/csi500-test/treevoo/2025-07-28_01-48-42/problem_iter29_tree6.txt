Thought: Synthesize price and volume-based alpha factors
    Sub-thought: Calculate daily returns and volume changes
        Sub-thought: Use closing prices to calculate simple returns (close[t] / close[t-1] - 1)
        Sub-thought: Measure the change in volume (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
        Sub-thought: Examine the ratio of volume change to previous volume ( (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) / volume[t-1] )
    Sub-thought: Analyze high-low range and intraday volatility
        Sub-thought: Calculate the daily range (high[t] - low[t])
        Sub-thought: Investigate the ratio of daily range to closing price ( (high[t] - low[t]) / close[t] )
        Sub-thought: Calculate True Range for each day
        Sub-thought: Sum True Range and divide by lookback period to get Average True Range (ATR)
    Sub-thought: Examine opening and closing gaps
        Sub-thought: Measure the gap between open and previous close (open[t] - close[t-1])
        Sub-thought: Investigate the ratio of gap to previous close ( (open[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1] )
        Sub-thought: Calculate the closing gap (close[t] - open[t])
    Sub-thought: Analyze moving averages and trend-following indicators
        Sub-thought: Compute 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day simple moving averages of closing prices
        Sub-thought: Investigate the difference between short-term and long-term moving averages (SMA_5[t] - SMA_20[t])
        Sub-thought: Identify when a short-term moving average crosses above or below a long-term moving average
        Sub-thought: Calculate 12-day EMA and 26-day EMA
        Sub-thought: MACD Line (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA)
        Sub-thought: Signal Line (9-day EMA of MACD Line)
        Sub-thought: MACD Histogram (MACD Line - Signal Line)
    Sub-thought: Explore momentum and rate of change
        Sub-thought: Compute the rate of change over various periods (e.g., ROC_5 = (close[t] / close[t-5]) - 1)
        Sub-thought: Compare ROCs over different periods (ROC_5[t] - ROC_10[t])
        Sub-thought: Calculate the cumulative return over a lookback period
            Sub-thought: Calculate daily returns (Close_t / Close_(t-1) - 1)
            Sub-thought: Sum daily returns over the lookback period
    Sub-thought: Investigate relative strength and outperformance
        Sub-thought: Define a benchmark index and compute the relative strength (RS) of the stock compared to the benchmark
        Sub-thought: Investigate the ratio of the stock's return to the benchmark's return (return_stock[t] / return_benchmark[t])
        Sub-thought: Count the number of days the stock outperformed the benchmark in a given period
        Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage of outperforming days in the period
    Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between volume and price
        Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of volume to daily range (volume[t] / (high[t] - low[t]))
        Sub-thought: Investigate the ratio of volume to absolute return (volume[t] / abs(close[t] / close[t-1] - 1))
