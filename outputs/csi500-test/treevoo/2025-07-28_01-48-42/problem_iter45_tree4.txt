Volume-Weighted Adjusted Momentum with Enhanced Price and Volume Trend Sensitivity
├── Compute Open-Close Spread
│   └── Subtract Close from Open
├── Calculate Raw Momentum
│   ├── Set Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Find difference between current and past average close
├── Adjust Momentum by Spread
│   └── Multiply Raw Momentum by absolute value of Open-Close Spread
├── Apply Volume Weighting
│   └── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by daily volume
