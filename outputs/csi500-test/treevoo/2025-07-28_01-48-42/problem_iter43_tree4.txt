Crossover-Enhanced Synthesized High-Low Momentum, Intraday Reversal, and Price-Volume Dynamics with Smoothing
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   └── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Subtract Open from Close to get Spread
├── Calculate Price Change
│   └── Subtract Close price of previous day from Close price of current day
├── Compute 5-Day Momentum
│   └── Sum Price Changes over the last 5 days
├── Adjust for Volume and Amount
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Range by Volume
│   └── Add the result to (High-Low Range * Square Root of Amount)
├── Adjust Momentum by Open-Close Spread
│   └── Multiply 5-Day Momentum by absolute value of Daily Open-Close Price Spread
├── Combine Momentum and Volume-Amount-Adjusted Range
│   └── Divide 5-Day Momentum by the sum of Volume-Adjusted and Amount-Adjusted Range
├── Enhance Combined Signal with Smoothing
│   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the combined signal
│       └── Choose a suitable EMA span, e.g., 5 days for short-term signals
├── Calculate Weighted Price Change
│   └── Multiply Price Change by (Volume + Square Root of Amount)
├── Combine Adjusted Range with Weighted Price Change
│   └── Add Enhanced Combined Signal to Weighted Price Change
├── Compute Intraday Return
│   ├── Subtract Open from High
│   └── Subtract Open from Low
├── Compute Intraday Reversal Score
│   └── Invert Intraday Return for Reversal
├── Integrate Momentum and Reversal
│   └── Multiply difference between current and previous High-Low Ranges by Intraday Reversal Score
├── Generate Factor Value
│   └── Multiply 10-Day High-Low Price Momentum by 10-Day Volume Moving Average
│       └── Divide by Close price
├── Introduce a New Volatility Component
│   └── Calculate Daily Volatility
│       └── Use formula: sqrt((High - Low)^2 / 4 + (Close - Open)^2 / 4)
│           └── Multiply final factor by the daily volatility
├── Combine All Factors
│   ├── Weighted Sum
│   │   ├── Intraday Return * 0.3
│   │   ├── Factor Value * 0.4
│   │   ├── Enhanced Combined Signal * 0.2
│   │   └── Generated Factor Value * 0.1
├── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply Combined Factors by Smoothened Momentum
    ├── Multiply by Volume Spike Factor
    │   └── Calculate Day-to-Day Volume Change
    │       └── Assign: 1 for Increase, 0 for No Increase
    ├── Multiply by Trend Strength
    │   └── Calculate Long-Term Momentum
    │       └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (Period: 20 Days)
    ├── Multiply by Intraday Volatility
    └── Add to Close-to-Open Price Change
└── Apply Volume Weighting
    └── Multiply Final Alpha Factor by daily volume
