Thought: Develop price-based alpha factors
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of high to low prices
    - Sub-thought: Compute the (high - low) / open as a measure of intraday volatility
    - Sub-thought: Use (close - open) / (high - low) as an indicator of trend strength
  - Sub-thought: Incorporate amount and volume into the factor calculation
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume over the past 10 days
      - Sub-thought: If the ratio is greater than 1, flag it as a high volume day
        - Sub-thought: When a high volume day occurs, use (close - open) * (volume / avg_volume) to emphasize significant price movements
    - Sub-thought: Use the product of the daily return and the relative volume as an indicator of price movement intensity
  - Sub-thought: Explore momentum factors using historical data
    - Sub-thought: Consider the difference between the current close and the moving average of closes over the last 20 days
    - Sub-thought: Introduce a factor that calculates the sum of positive and negative returns over the last 50 days separately
      - Sub-thought: Divide the sum of positive returns by the absolute value of the sum of negative returns for a measure of bullishness
  - Sub-thought: Analyze the effect of consecutive days with similar price movements
    - Sub-thought: Count the number of consecutive days where the close was higher than the open
      - Sub-thought: If the count exceeds a threshold, interpret it as a sign of a potential uptrend
    - Sub-thought: Similarly, count the number of consecutive days where the close was lower than the open
      - Sub-thought: A high count could indicate a potential downtrend, aiding in reversal or continuation strategy
  - Sub-thought: Incorporate the concept of gaps
    - Sub-thought: Identify if today's open is significantly different from yesterday's close
      - Sub-thought: When a gap up occurs (open > previous close), compute the magnitude of the gap and use it as a signal for further price movement
      - Sub-thought: For a gap down (open < previous close), similarly calculate the gap size for a downward momentum signal
  - Sub-thought: Utilize the relationship between price and volume
    - Sub-thought: Examine whether high volume days are associated with large price changes
      - Sub-thought: Create a factor that measures the consistency of this relationship, perhaps by calculating the correlation between percentage change in price and volume
  - Sub-thought: Investigate the impact of market breadth
    - Sub-thought: Measure the proportion of days within a period where the stock outperforms the index
      - Sub-thought: This can be used as a factor to identify stocks showing strength relative to the broader market
