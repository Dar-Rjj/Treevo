Crossover-Enhanced High-Low Momentum with Volume-Weighted Adjustments and Intraday Reversal
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   └── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Compute Intraday Reversal Score
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Use Low price
│   └── Invert Intraday Return for Reversal
├── Adjust for Volume and Amount
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Range by Volume
│   └── Multiply High-Low Range by Square Root of Amount
│       └── Add the two results (Volume-Adjusted and Amount-Adjusted)
├── Combine Momentum and Volume-Amount-Adjusted Range
│   ├── Calculate Price Change
│   │   └── Subtract Close price of previous day from Close price of current day
│   ├── Compute 5-Day Momentum
│   │   └── Sum Price Change over the last 5 days
│   ├── Adjust 5-Day Momentum by Open-Close Spread
│   │   ├── Use calculated 5-Day Momentum
│   │   └── Multiply by the absolute value of the Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Divide 5-Day Momentum by the sum of Volume-Adjusted and Amount-Adjusted Range
├── Enhance Combined Signal with Smoothing
│   ├── Apply a Smoothing Filter
│   │   ├── Use Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the combined signal
│   │   └── Choose a suitable EMA span
│   │       └── E.g., 5 days for short-term signals
├── Integrate Intraday Reversal into Final Factor
│   ├── Consider Close-to-Open Price Change
│   │   ├── Calculate Close-to-Open Difference
│   │   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   │   └── Use Open price
│   │   └── Integrate into Final Factor
│   │       └── Multiply Volume-Adjusted Reversal with C-O Diff
│   └── Adjust 5-Day Momentum by Open-Close Spread (Intraday Reversal)
│       ├── Use calculated 5-Day Momentum
│       └── Multiply by the absolute value of the Daily Open-Close Price Spread
├── Introduce a New Volatility Component
│   ├── Calculate Daily Volatility
│   │   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices
│   │   └── Use the formula: sqrt((High - Low)^2 / 4 + (Close - Open)^2 / 4)
│   └── Integrate Volatility into the Final Factor
│       └── Multiply the final factor by the daily volatility
├── Enhance with Trend Confirmation
│   ├── Calculate Long-Term Momentum
│   │   ├── Use Close price (t) minus Close price (t-20)
│   └── Integrate Long-Term Momentum into the Final Factor
│       └── Multiply the final factor by the long-term momentum
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply Enhanced Combined Signal by Smoothened Momentum
    ├── Multiply by Integrated Intraday Reversal
    ├── Multiply by New Volatility Component
    ├── Multiply by Long-Term Momentum
    └── Add to Close-to-Open Price Change
