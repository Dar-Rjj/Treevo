Crossover-Enhanced High-Low Momentum with Volume-Weighted Adjustments and Intraday Reversal
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   └── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Subtract Open from Close to get Spread
├── Calculate Price Change
│   └── Subtract Close price of previous day from Close price of current day
├── Compute 5-Day Momentum
│   └── Sum Price Change over the last 5 days
├── Adjust for Volume and Amount
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Range by Volume
│   └── Add the result to (High-Low Range * Square Root of Amount)
├── Adjust 5-Day Momentum by Open-Close Spread
│   └── Multiply by the absolute value of the Daily Open-Close Price Spread
├── Combine Momentum and Volume-Amount-Adjusted Range
│   └── Divide 5-Day Momentum by the sum of Volume-Adjusted and Amount-Adjusted Range
├── Enhance Combined Signal with Smoothing
│   ├── Apply a Smoothing Filter
│   │   ├── Use Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the combined signal
│   │   └── E.g., 5 days for short-term signals
├── Calculate Weighted Price Change
│   └── Multiply Price Change by (Volume + Square Root of Amount)
├── Combine Adjusted Range with Weighted Price Change
│   └── Add Enhanced Combined Signal to Weighted Price Change
├── Compute Intraday Reversal Score
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   │   └── Subtract Low price from High price
│   └── Invert Intraday Return for Reversal
├── Consider Close-to-Open Price Change
│   ├── Calculate Close-to-Open Difference
│   │   └── Subtract Open price from Close price
│   └── Integrate into Final Factor
│       └── Multiply Intraday Reversal with C-O Diff
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Daily Close Price Return
│   │   └── Divide Close price (t) by Close price (t-1)
│   └── Smoothed Momentum
│       ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average to Daily Close Price Returns
│       └── Period: 12 Days
├── Calculate Volume Spike Factor
│   ├── Calculate Day-to-Day Volume Change
│   │   └── Subtract Volume (t-1) from Volume (t)
│   └── Indicate Significant Volume Increase
│       └── If Volume Change > 2 * Standard Deviation of Last 20 Days Volume, assign 1; else, 0
├── Final Alpha Factor
│   ├── Multiply Enhanced Combined Signal by Smoothened Momentum
│   ├── Multiply by Volume Spike Factor
│   └── Add to Close-to-Open Price Change
└── Interpretation
    └── Stronger indicator of future return when there is a significant volume spike and high momentum
