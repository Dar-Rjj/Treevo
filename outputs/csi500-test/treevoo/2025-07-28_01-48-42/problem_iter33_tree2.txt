Volume-Weighted Adjusted Momentum with Price Trend Sensitivity
├── Compute Open-Close Spread
│   └── Subtract Close from Open to find daily spread
├── Calculate Raw Momentum
│   ├── Set Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Find difference between current and past average close
├── Adjust Momentum by Spread
│   └── Multiply Raw Momentum by absolute value of Open-Close Spread
├── Apply Volume Weighting
│   └── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by daily volume
└── Incorporate Price Trend Sensitivity
    ├── Calculate High-Low Range
    │   └── Subtract Low from High for each day in the lookback period
    ├── Determine Trend Direction
    │   └── If Close > Open, trend is positive; else, negative
    └── Modify Momentum based on Trend
        └── If trend is positive, multiply Volume-Weighted Adjusted Momentum 
             by (1 + ratio of High-Low range to Open price); if negative,
             multiply by (1 - ratio of High-Low range to Open price)
