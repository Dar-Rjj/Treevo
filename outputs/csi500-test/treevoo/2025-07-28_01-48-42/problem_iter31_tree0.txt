Volume-Weighted Momentum Adjusted by Open-Close Spread
├── Compute Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Subtract Close from Open to get Spread
├── Calculate Momentum
│   ├── Set Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Find Difference Between Current and Average Close
├── Adjust Momentum with Absolute Daily Open-Close Spread
│   ├── Take Absolute Value of Daily Open-Close Spread
│   └── Divide Momentum by This Absolute Value
├── Volume-Weight the Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Volume
│   └── Aggregate the Weighted Adjusted Momentum Over Lookback
└── Determine Final Alpha Factor
    └── Divide Aggregated Weighted Adjusted Momentum by Total Volume Over Lookback
