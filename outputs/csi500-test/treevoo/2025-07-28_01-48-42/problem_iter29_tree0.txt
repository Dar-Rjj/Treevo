Thought: Volume-Weighted Momentum Adjusted by Open-Close Spread and Intraday Volatility
├── Calculate Daily Open-Close Price Spread
│   └── Subtract Close price from Open price to get Spread
├── Calculate Momentum
│   ├── Determine Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Compute difference between current and average close
├── Adjust Momentum by Absolute Daily Open-Close Spread
│   ├── Calculate Absolute Value of Daily Open-Close Spread
│   └── Divide Momentum by Absolute Value of Daily Open-Close Spread
├── Weight Adjusted Momentum by Volume
│   ├── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Volume
│   └── Sum the weighted adjusted momentum over the lookback period
├── Final Alpha Factor Component 1
│   └── Divide the sum of weighted adjusted momentum by the total volume over the lookback period
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── High-Low Difference (High - Low)
│   ├── Average True Range (ATR) over a lookback period
│   │   ├── Calculate True Range for each day
│   │   └── Sum True Range and divide by lookback period
│   └── Weight Intraday Volatility by Volume
│       ├── Multiply Intraday Volatility by Volume
│       └── Sum the weighted intraday volatility over the lookback period
└── Final Alpha Factor Component 2
    └── Divide the sum of weighted intraday volatility by the total volume over the lookback period
├── Combine Final Alpha Factors
│   └── Add Final Alpha Factor Component 1 and Final Alpha Factor Component 2
└── Final Alpha Factor
    └── Normalize the combined alpha factor
