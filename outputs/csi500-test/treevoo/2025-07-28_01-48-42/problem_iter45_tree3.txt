Volume-Weighted Enhanced Momentum with Price Trend and Volatility Sensitivity
├── Compute Open-Close Spread
│   └── Subtract Close from Open
├── Calculate Raw Momentum
│   ├── Set Lookback Period (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Find difference between current and past average close
├── Adjust Momentum by Spread
│   └── Multiply Raw Momentum by absolute value of Open-Close Spread
├── Apply Volume Weighting
│   └── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by daily volume
├── Incorporate Enhanced Price Trend Sensitivity
│   ├── Determine Trend Direction
│   │   └── If Close > Open, trend is positive; else, negative
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   │   └── Subtract Low from High
│   ├── Modify Momentum based on Trend
│   │   └── If trend is positive, multiply by (1 + ratio of (High-Low) to Open);
│   │        if negative, multiply by (1 - ratio of (High-Low) to Open)
├── Incorporate Opening Price Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Opening Price Volatility
│   │   ├── Set Lookback Period (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   └── Compute standard deviation of open prices
│   └── Further Adjust Momentum
│       └── If trend is positive, multiply by (1 + ratio of Opening Price Volatility to Open);
│            if negative, multiply by (1 - ratio of Opening Price Volatility to Open)
├── Incorporate Trading Volume Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Volume Volatility
│   │   ├── Set Lookback Period (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   └── Compute standard deviation of daily volumes
│   └── Final Adjust Momentum
│       └── If trend is positive, multiply by (1 + ratio of Volume Volatility to average volume);
│            if negative, multiply by (1 - ratio of Volume Volatility to average volume)
└── Incorporate Amount-Driven Volatility
    ├── Calculate Amount-Driven Volatility
    │   ├── Set Lookback Period (e.g., 5 days)
    │   └── Compute standard deviation of daily amounts
    └── Finalize Momentum
        └── If trend is positive, multiply by (1 + ratio of Amount-Driven Volatility to average amount);
             if negative, multiply by (1 - ratio of Amount-Driven Volatility to average amount)
