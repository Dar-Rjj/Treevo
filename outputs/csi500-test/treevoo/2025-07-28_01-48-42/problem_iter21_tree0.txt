Thought: Analyze basic price patterns to identify potential alpha factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate the price change from open to close (Intraday Movement)
  - Sub-thought: Use the difference between close and open prices as a factor
- Sub-thought: Examine high and low prices for volatility
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the range (High - Low) as a measure of daily volatility
    - Sub-thought: Use the range as a factor
- Sub-thought: Consider the relationship between volume and price movement
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of volume to price change (Volume to Price Ratio)
    - Sub-thought: Use the Volume to Price Ratio as a factor
- Sub-thought: Investigate the interaction between amount and price
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of amount to price (Amount to Price Ratio)
    - Sub-thought: Use the Amount to Price Ratio as a factor
- Sub-thought: Analyze the momentum of the stock
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price over a fixed period (e.g., 5 days)
    - Sub-thought: Use the percentage change as a factor
- Sub-thought: Incorporate the trend of the stock
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the moving average of the closing price over a short period (e.g., 10 days)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the moving average of the closing price over a long period (e.g., 50 days)
  - Sub-thought: Determine the difference between the short-term and long-term moving averages (Trend Factor)
    - Sub-thought: Use the Trend Factor as an alpha factor
