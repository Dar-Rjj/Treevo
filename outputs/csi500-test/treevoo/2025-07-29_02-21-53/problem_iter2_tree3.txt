Combined Price and High-Low Range Momentum with Volume-Weighted Factor
├── Calculate 5-Day Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate Difference between Today's Close and 5 Days Ago Close
├── Calculate Daily High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Smooth High-Low Range
│   └── Apply Moving Average (e.g., 20-day)
├── Calculate Long-Term High-Low Range
│   └── Use High and Low prices over a longer period (e.g., 50-day)
├── Compute Momentum of High-Low Ranges
│   ├── Subtract Short-Term Smoothed Range from Long-Term Range
│   └── This gives an indication of the trend in volatility
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply Momentum by Volume
└── Combine All Factors
    ├── Use 5-Day Price Momentum
    ├── Use Weighted Momentum of High-Low Ranges
    └── Sum the Two Factors
