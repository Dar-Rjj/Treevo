High-Low Range and Volume Momentum Indicator
├── Calculate Daily High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Smooth High-Low Range
│   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (e.g., 20-day)
├── Calculate Long-Term High-Low Range
│   └── Use High and Low prices over a longer period (e.g., 50-day)
├── Compute Momentum of High-Low Ranges
│   ├── Subtract Short-Term Smoothed Range from Long-Term Range
│   └── This gives an indication of the trend in volatility
├── Weight by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply Momentum by Volume

    ├── Combine with High-Low Range Momentum
    │   └── Add Smoothed Price Change to High-Low Range Momentum
    └── Final Factor
        └── Resulting factor combines price movement and volatility trends
