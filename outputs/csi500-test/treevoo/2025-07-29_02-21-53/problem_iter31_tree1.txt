Thought: Calculate the difference between the close price and open price to gauge stock performance within a day.
    Sub-thought: Consider the absolute value of the daily return (close - open) as an alpha factor, reflecting the stock's intra-day strength or weakness.
        Sub-thought: Extend this by comparing today's absolute return against the average absolute return over the past N days to identify unusually strong or weak performance.
            Sub-thought: Additionally, incorporate the direction of the daily return (positive or negative) into the factor, distinguishing between up and down days.
                Sub-thought: Further refine by including the ratio of the current day's high to low range over the same average range of the past N days, to capture volatility and potential breakout scenarios.
                    Sub-thought: Finally, integrate the percentage change in trading volume compared to its N-day average, alongside the aforementioned factors, for a comprehensive assessment of the day's activity and market sentiment.

Thought: Use the daily close price to compute a moving average trend, identifying potential momentum or reversal setups.
    Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over M days and compare it with the current day's close to determine if the stock is trending above or below its recent average.
        Sub-thought: Expand this concept by introducing a short-term SMA (e.g., 5 days) and a long-term SMA (e.g., 20 days) to form a dual moving average crossover system, indicating buy or sell signals.
            Sub-thought: Enhance the factor by calculating the rate of change (ROC) of the short-term SMA relative to the long-term SMA, to quantify the strength of the trend.
                Sub-thought: Also, incorporate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for the last M days, and compare it with the current day's close to assess alignment or divergence from the average expected price level considering volume.
                    Sub-thought: Lastly, consider the ratio of the current day's VWAP to the M-day SMA, as a measure to identify undervalued or overvalued conditions based on both price and volume.
