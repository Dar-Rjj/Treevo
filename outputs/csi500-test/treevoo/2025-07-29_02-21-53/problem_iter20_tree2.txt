Thought: Synthesize Price, Volume, and Trend Analysis for Enhanced Predictive Insights
- Sub-Thought: Use Moving Averages to Identify Trends
  - Action: Calculate 5-Day, 10-Day, and 20-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) of Close Prices
  - Action: Compute the difference between 10-Day SMA and 20-Day SMA as a Momentum Indicator
- Sub-Thought: Detect Breakout Events from Historical Highs/Lows
  - Action: Identify Days Where Close Price Exceeds Highest High or Lowest Low over Last 30 Days
  - Action: Assign a Score Based on Number of Consecutive Days of Breakout
- Sub-Thought: Explore Volume Changes Around Significant Price Movements
  - Action: Calculate the Percentage Change in Volume from Previous Day
  - Action: Mark Days with Large Volume Increase (>10%) and Associated Price Movement (>2%)
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate Open and Close Prices for Daily Price Behavior
  - Action: Determine if the Stock Opened Higher but Closed Lower (Bearish Signal)
  - Action: Determine if the Stock Opened Lower but Closed Higher (Bullish Signal)
- Sub-Thought: Investigate the Relationship Between Amount and Volume
  - Action: Calculate the Ratio of Amount to Volume (Price Weighted Volume)
  - Action: Observe Trends in this Ratio Over Time to Indicate Accumulation or Distribution
- Sub-Thought: Consider the Impact of Gap Openings
  - Action: Measure the Difference Between Today’s Open and Yesterday’s Close
  - Action: Categorize Gaps as Up-Gap (Open > Yesterday's Close) or Down-Gap (Open < Yesterday's Close)
- Sub-Thought: Leverage High and Low Prices for Volatility Measures
  - Action: Compute the Range (High - Low) for Each Day
  - Action: Track Moving Average of Daily Ranges to Assess Volatility Trends
- Sub-Thought: Combine High-Low Range and Volume Momentum
  - Action: Calculate Daily High-Low Range
    - Use High price
    - Use Low price
  - Action: Smooth High-Low Range
    - Apply Exponential Moving Average (e.g., 20-day)
  - Action: Compute Momentum of High-Low Ranges
    - Subtract Short-Term Smoothed Range from Long-Term Range
  - Action: Weight by Volume
    - Use Volume
    - Multiply Momentum by Volume
- Sub-Thought: Integrate Price Change
  - Action: Calculate Daily Price Change
    - Use Close price
    - Use Open price
  - Action: Smooth Price Change
    - Apply Exponential Moving Average (e.g., 20-day)
  - Action: Combine with High-Low Range Momentum
    - Add Smoothed Price Change to High-Low Range Momentum
- Sub-Thought: Integrate Price Trend
  - Action: Calculate Long-Term Price Trend
    - Use Close price over a longer period (e.g., 100-day)
  - Action: Smooth Long-Term Price Trend
    - Apply Exponential Moving Average (e.g., 100-day)
  - Action: Compute Price Trend Momentum
    - Subtract Short-Term Smoothed Price Change from Long-Term Price Trend
  - Action: Combine with High-Low Range and Volume Momentum
    - Add Price Trend Momentum to the combined factor
- Final Factor
  - Resulting factor combines price movement, volatility trends, and long-term price trend
