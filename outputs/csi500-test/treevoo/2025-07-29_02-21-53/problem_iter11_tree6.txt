Crossover Enhanced Intraday Price and Volume Momentum with High-Low Range
├── Compute Averages
│   ├── 10-day Close Price Average
│   └── 30-day Close Price Average
├── Determine Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract 30-day from 10-day Average
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Range and True Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   ├── Use Low price
│   └── Use Previous Close price
│       ├── Compute Maximum of Differences for True Range
│           ├── High - Low
│           ├── High - Previous Close
│           └── Previous Close - Low
├── Adjust for Volume Impact on Price
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply High-Low Range by Volume
├── Detect Volume Spike
│   ├── 5-day Volume Average
│   └── If current volume > 2 * 5-day average, mark spike
├── Adjust Momentum Based on Spike
│   ├── If Spike Detected: Multiply momentum by 0.8
│   └── No Spike: Keep Original Momentum
├── Aggregate Price Movements and Smooth High-Low Ranges
│   ├── Sum of High-Low Differences over a Period
│   │   ├── Aggregate Daily High-Low Differences
│   └── Sum of Close-Open Differences over a Period
│       ├── Aggregate Daily Close-Open Differences
│   ├── Smooth High-Low Range
│   │   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (e.g., 20-day)
│   └── Calculate Long-Term High-Low Range
│       └── Use High and Low prices over a longer period (e.g., 50-day)
├── Calculate Combined Price and High-Low Range Momentum
│   ├── Compare Aggregate Price Movements and High-Low Ranges
│   │   ├── High-Low Difference
│   │   ├── Close-Open Difference
│   │   ├── Subtract Short-Term Smoothed Range from Long-Term Range
│   └── Weight by Recent Price Volatility
│       ├── Calculate Standard Deviation of Close Prices
│       └── Assign More Weight to Higher Volatility Days
├── Evaluate Volume Activity
│   ├── Compute Average Volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Calculate Exponential Moving Average
│   └── Identify Days with High Volume
│       ├── Compare Each Day's Volume to Average
│       └── Mark Days Above a Threshold as High Volume
├── Integrate Price, High-Low Range, and Volume Activity
│   ├── Multiply Combined Momentum Score by High Volume Indicator
│   │   ├── Apply Weight Based on Volume Activity
│   │   └── Adjust for High Volume Days
│   │       ├── Increase Factor Value on High Volume Days
│   └── Generate Final Alpha Factor
│       ├── Combine Price, High-Low Range, and Volume Effects
│       └── Include Interaction Term
│           ├── Multiply High-Low Range Momentum by Close-Open Difference
│           └── Add Interaction Term to Final Alpha Factor
└── Dynamic Momentum Indicator
    ├── Incorporate Previous Day's Indicator
    │   ├── Use Yesterday's Crossover Enhanced Alpha Factor
    │   └── Use Today's Crossover Enhanced Alpha Factor
    └── Assess Trend Continuity and Reversal Potential
        ├── Determine Direction of Momentum Change
        └── Factor in Volatility for Smoothing
            ├── Use Standard Deviation of Recent Daily Returns
            └── Apply to Identify Robust Trends
