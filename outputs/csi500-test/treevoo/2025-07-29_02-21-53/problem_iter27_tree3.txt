Thought: Explore trend and momentum signals from historical prices to generate alpha factors.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the price change from open to close, aiming to capture intraday market sentiment.
    - Sub-thought: Compute daily return as (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t for each day t.
    - Sub-thought: Sum of returns over a lookback window of N days to identify short-term trends.
      - Sub-thought: Use the sum of N-day returns to create a rolling trend factor, reflecting the overall direction of the stock.
        - Sub-thought: Incorporate a weighted sum where more recent returns have higher weights.
  - Sub-thought: Utilize high and low prices in conjunction with close to understand price volatility and direction.
    - Sub-thout: Determine the true range (max(High_t, Close_{t-1}) - min(Low_t, Close_{t-1})) for measuring daily volatility.
    - Sub-thought: Calculate average true range (ATR) over M days to gauge overall volatility.
      - Sub-thought: Develop a relative ATR by comparing the current ATR to the ATR over a longer period (e.g., 2M days), to identify changes in volatility.
        - Sub-thought: Introduce a directional ATR that considers the sign of the daily return, adjusting the ATR based on whether the market is bullish or bearish.
  - Sub-thought: Analyze volume and amount data to infer trading activity strength.
    - Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of today's volume to the average volume of the last L days, indicating relative trading intensity.
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the sum of money flow (Volume_t * (2*Close_t - High_t - Low_t)) over P days to reflect buying or selling pressure.
      - Sub-thought: Enhance the money flow factor by incorporating the sign of the daily return, giving more weight to positive or negative money flow based on the return direction.
        - Sub-thought: Incorporate a cumulative money flow factor that tracks the running total of money flow over a longer period.
  - Sub-thought: Combine multiple metrics to create more sophisticated alpha factors.
    - Sub-thought: Develop a composite factor by combining the N-day return, ATR, and volume intensity into a single score.
      - Sub-thought: Assign weights to each component based on their perceived importance or past performance.
        - Sub-thought: Introduce a dynamic weighting scheme that adjusts the weights based on the recent performance of each individual factor.
        - Sub-thought: Include a cross-validation step to optimize the weights of the composite factor.
