Crossover Enhanced Intraday Price and Volume Momentum with High-Low Range Analysis
├── Calculate True Range and Adjust by Volume
│   ├── Compute True Range using High, Low, and Previous Close
│   └── Multiply True Range by Volume
├── Aggregate and Smooth High-Low Ranges
│   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average (20-day) to Daily High-Low Differences
├── Integrate Price and High-Low Range with Volume
│   ├── Combine Volume-Adjusted True Range and Smoothed High-Low Ranges
│   └── Generate Final Alpha Factor
│       ├── Multiply Combined Measures by High Volume Indicator
│       └── Add Interaction Term (Smoothed High-Low Range * High-Low Difference)
└── Incorporate Price Momentum
    ├── Calculate 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages of Close Prices
    ├── Compute the Difference between 5-day and 20-day Moving Averages
    ├── Multiply the Price Momentum Difference by the Volume
    └── Integrate into Final Alpha Factor
        ├── Add the Price Momentum Measure to the Final Alpha Factor
        └── Ensure the Final Factor is Coherent and Interpretable
