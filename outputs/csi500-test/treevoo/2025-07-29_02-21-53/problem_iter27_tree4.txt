Thought: Explore trend and momentum signals from historical prices to generate alpha factors.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the price change from open to close, aiming to capture intraday market sentiment.
    - Sub-thought: Compute daily return as (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t for each day t.
    - Sub-thought: Sum of returns over a lookback window of N days to identify short-term trends.
      - Sub-thought: Use the sum of N-day returns to create a rolling trend factor, reflecting the overall direction of the stock.
  - Sub-thought: Utilize high and low prices in conjunction with close to understand price volatility and direction.
    - Sub-thought: Determine the true range (max(High_t, Close_{t-1}) - min(Low_t, Close_{t-1})) for measuring daily volatility.
    - Sub-thought: Calculate average true range (ATR) over M days to gauge overall volatility.
      - Sub-thought: Develop a relative ATR by comparing the current ATR to the ATR over a longer period (e.g., 2M days), to identify changes in volatility.
  - Sub-thought: Analyze volume and amount data to infer trading activity strength.
    - Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of today's volume to the average volume of the last L days, indicating relative trading intensity.
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the sum of money flow (Volume_t * (2*Close_t - High_t - Low_t)) over P days to reflect buying or selling pressure.
      - Sub-thought: Enhance the money flow factor by incorporating the sign of the daily return, giving more weight to positive or negative money flow based on the return direction.
  - Sub-thought: Combine multiple metrics to create more sophisticated alpha factors.
    - Sub-thought: Develop a composite factor by combining the N-day return, ATR, and volume intensity into a single score.
      - Sub-thought: Assign weights to each component based on their perceived importance or past performance.
        - Sub-thought: Introduce a dynamic weighting scheme that adjusts the weights based on the recent performance of each individual factor.
    - Sub-thought: Incorporate the relationship between high and low prices to the closing price to measure the strength of the trend.
      - Sub-thought: Calculate the cumulative difference between daily high and close prices over a lookback window of Q days.
      - Sub-thought: Calculate the cumulative difference between daily low and close prices over a lookback window of Q days.
      - Sub-thought: Develop a trend strength factor by subtracting the cumulative low-close difference from the cumulative high-close difference.
  - Sub-thought: Investigate the interaction between price and volume to detect potential reversal points.
    - Sub-thought: Compute the percentage change in volume from the previous day.
    - Sub-thought: Identify days where the price and volume move in opposite directions.
      - Sub-thought: Create a divergence factor by summing the magnitude of these divergences over a lookback window of R days.
    - Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between the divergence factor and the N-day return to identify potential turning points.
  - Sub-thought: Examine the impact of large price movements on future returns.
    - Sub-thought: Identify days where the absolute value of the daily return exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 5%).
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the average return in the days following such large moves over a lookback window of S days.
    - Sub-thought: Use this average return as an indicator of the likelihood of a continuation or reversal after a large price movement.
