Crossover of Enhanced Intraday Price and Volume Momentum with High-Low Range Analysis and Intraday Price Momentum and Volume Synchronized Oscillator
├── Calculate True Range and Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Compute True Range using High, Low, and Previous Close
│   └── Compute Intraday Price Movement using High, Low, Open, and Close
├── Smooth True Ranges
│   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (20-day) to True Range
├── Calculate Long-Term True Range
│   └── Use High and Low prices over a longer period (e.g., 50-day)
├── Compute Momentum of True Ranges
│   ├── Subtract Short-Term Smoothed Range from Long-Term Range
│   └── This gives an indication of the trend in volatility
├── Adjust for Volume Impact on Price
│   ├── Multiply True Range by Volume
│   └── Multiply Intraday Price Movement by Volume
├── Aggregate and Smooth High-Low Ranges and Price Movements
│   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average (20-day) to Sum of Daily High-Low Differences
│   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (20-day) to Sum of Daily Close-Open Differences
├── Integrate Intraday Price Movements
│   ├── Calculate Daily High-Low Difference
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Use Low price
│   └── Calculate Daily Close-Open Difference
│       ├── Use Close price
│       └── Use Open price
├── Aggregate and Smooth Aggregated Intraday Price Movements
│   ├── Sum of High-Low Differences over a Period
│   │   ├── Aggregate Daily High-Low Differences
│   └── Sum of Close-Open Differences over a Period
│       ├── Aggregate Daily Close-Open Differences
│   ├── Smooth Aggregated High-Low Differences
│   │   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (20-day)
│   └── Smooth Aggregated Close-Open Differences
│       └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (20-day)
├── Combine True Range and Intraday Price Movements
│   ├── Add Smoothed True Range Momentum to Aggregated Price Movements
│   └── Generate Combined Factor
├── Evaluate Volume Activity
│   ├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average of Volume (20-day)
│   └── Identify High Volume Days
│       ├── Compare Each Day's Volume to Average
│       └── Mark Days Above a Threshold as High Volume
├── Integrate Combined Factors
│   ├── Combine True Range, Intraday Price Movements, and Volume
│   │   ├── Multiply Combined Measures by High Volume Indicator
│   │   └── Add Interaction Term (High-Low Range Momentum * Close-Open Difference)
│   └── Adjust for Volume Impact
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine True Range, Intraday Price Movements, and Volume Effects
    └── Smooth Oscillation with Exponential Moving Average
        ├── Take the result of the final alpha factor
        └── Apply an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over 14 days
