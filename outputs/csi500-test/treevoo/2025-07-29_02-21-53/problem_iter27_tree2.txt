Crossover Enhanced Intraday Price and Volume Momentum with High-Low Range Analysis
├── Calculate True Range and Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Compute True Range using High, Low, and Previous Close
│   └── Compute Intraday Price Movement using High, Low, Open, and Close
├── Adjust for Volume Impact on Price
│   ├── Multiply True Range by Volume
│   └── Multiply Intraday Price Movement by Volume
├── Smooth High-Low Ranges and Price Movements
│   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average (20-day) to Daily High-Low Differences
│   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (10-day) to Daily Close-Open Differences
├── Calculate Combined Price and High-Low Range Momentum
│   └── Subtract 10-day from 20-day Smoothed Ranges
├── Evaluate Volume Activity
│   ├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average of Volume (20-day)
│   └── Identify High Volume Days
├── Integrate Price, High-Low Range, and Volume Activity
│   ├── Combine Volume-Adjusted Measures
│   └── Assess Trend Continuity and Reversal Potential
│       ├── Introduce a Short-Term Momentum Indicator
│       │   └── Calculate 5-day EMA of Intraday Price Movement
│       └── Integrate Short-Term Momentum with Long-Term Indicators
│           └── Subtract 5-day EMA from 20-day EMA of Intraday Price Movement
└── Generate Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply Combined Measures by High Volume Indicator
    └── Add Interaction Term (High-Low Range Momentum * Close-Open Difference * Volume * Short-Term Momentum)
