Integrated and Enhanced Alpha Factor Combining Intraday Dynamics, Momentum, and Volume-Based Indicators with Price Level Adjustment and Volume Trend
├── Calculate Adjusted Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
│   └── Divide by (Current Day's Open - Previous Day's Close)
├── Calculate 5-Day Average High-Low Spread
│   ├── Sum of (High - Low) over 5 days
│   └── Divide by 5
├── Calculate 5-Day Momentum
│   ├── Subtract Close price of 5 days ago from today's Close
│   └── Divide the result by Close price of 5 days ago
├── Multiply High-Low Spread and Momentum
│   ├── Use 5-Day Average High-Low Spread
│   └── Use 5-Day Momentum
├── Weight by Volume and Close Difference

│   └── Multiply Both with Volume-Weighted Return
├── Final Factor Calculation
    ├── Combine Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum
    │   ├── Add (Weight of 0.3 * IntradayMomentumScore) to (Weight of 0.3 * Intraday Volatility) and (Weight of 0.4 * Adjusted Momentum)
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── Use Combined Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum
        ├── Use Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
        └── Combine Combined Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum, and Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
            └── Formula: (Combined Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum * 0.5) + (Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal * 0.5)
├── Apply Price Level Adjustment
    ├── Calculate Price Level Ratio
    │   ├── Use Close price
