Crossover Alpha Mining Integrating Intraday Dynamics, Momentum, and Volume-Based Indicators
├── Calculate Adjusted Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
│   └── Divide by (Current Day's Open - Previous Day's Close)
├── Weight by Volume and Close Difference
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Calculate Close Difference (Close - Previous Day's Close)
│   └── Multiply Adjusted Intraday Price Movement by (Volume * Close Difference)
├── Integrate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Compute Daily Range (High - Low)
│   └── Compute 20-day Exponential Moving Average of Daily Ranges
├── Incorporate Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
│   ├── Formula: (Close - Open) / Open
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Return
│   ├── Multiply Volume by Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
├── Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
│   ├── Intraday Return Weight: Amount
│   └── Reversal Signal Weight: Volume
│   └── Formula: (Amount * Adjusted Intraday Return) + (Volume * Reversal Signal)
├── Combine Enhanced Factors
│   ├── Use Weighted Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Use Intraday Volatility
│   └── Add Both to Volume-Weighted Return
├── Adjust by Relative Volume
│   ├── Calculate 20-day Exponential Moving Average of Volume
│   └── Divide Combined Factor by Relative Volume (Current Day's Volume / 20-day EMA of Volume)
├── Incorporate Close Price Momentum
│   ├── Calculate 10-day Simple Moving Average of Close price
├── Adjust Momentum by Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Divide Momentum by Intraday Volatility
├── Construct Momentum Factor
│   ├── Calculate the percentage change in closing price over different time periods (e.g., 5, 20, 60 days)
├── Design Volatility Measures
│   ├── Compute the standard deviation of daily log-returns over different windows (e.g., 5, 20, 60 days)
├── Incorporate Volume-Based Indicators
│   ├── Calculate the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume over a certain period (e.g., 20 days)
├── Explore Price Action Patterns
│   ├── Identify bullish or bearish candlestick patterns over the last n days (e.g., engulfing, doji)
│   └── Quantify the pattern by assigning a score based on its strength and frequency
├── Develop Trend-Following Signals
│   ├── Determine the difference between the current close and a moving average (e.g., 20-day SMA)
│   └── Assign a score based on the position of the close relative to the moving average (above: positive, below: negative)
├── Create Liquidity-Related Factors
│   ├── Measure the spread between high and low prices as an indicator of intraday volatility
│   └── Analyze the relationship between trade volume and this spread
├── Integrate Intraday and High-Low Spread Momentum
│   ├── 5-Day Momentum
│   │   ├── (Close price - Close price 5 days ago) / Close price 5 days ago
│   │   └── Multiply 5-Day Average High-Low Spread by 5-Day Momentum
│   │       └── Label as HighLowSpreadMomentum
│   └── Combine Intraday and High-Low Spread Momentum
│       ├── Add IntradayMomentumScore to HighLowSpreadMomentum
│       └── Label as IntegratedMomentumFactor
├── Introduce Volume Trend
