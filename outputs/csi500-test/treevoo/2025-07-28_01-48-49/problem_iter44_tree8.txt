  - Sub-sub-Thought: Average true range over the last 14 days
- Sub-Thought: Analyze Price Gaps
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Difference between current day's open and previous day's close

  - Sub-sub-Thought: Calculate 30-day Moving Average of Close price
- Sub-Thought: Adjust Momentum by Intraday Volatility
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Multiply Momentum by Intraday Volatility
- Sub-Thought: Final Factor Calculation
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Add (0.6 * Adjusted Intraday Price Movement) + (0.2 * Intraday Volatility) + (0.2 * Adjusted Momentum)
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Final Alpha Factor
    - Sub-sub-sub-Thought: (Combined Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum * 0.8) + (Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal * 0.2)
