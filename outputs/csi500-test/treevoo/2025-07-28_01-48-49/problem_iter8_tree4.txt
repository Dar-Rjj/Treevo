│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   └── Formula: (High - Low) / Low
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
│   └── Formula: (Close - Open) / Open
├── Combine Intraday and Reversal Signals
│   ├── Intraday Return Weight: Use Amount
│   └── Reversal Signal Weight: Use Volume
│   └── Formula: (Intraday Return * Intraday Return Weight) + (Reversal Signal * Reversal Signal Weight)
├── Calculate High-Low Momentum
│   └── Compute Sum of High-Low Returns over a window (e.g., 10 days)
├── Calculate 5-Day Average High-Low Spread
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Subtract Low price
│   └── Divide by 5
├── Calculate 10-Day EMA of High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High-Low Spread
│   └── Apply EMA with a 10-day span
├── Calculate Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price of today
│   ├── Use Close price of 5 days ago
│   └── Subtract and divide by Close price of 5 days ago
├── Multiply 5-Day Average High-Low Spread by Momentum
│   ├── Use 5-Day Average High-Low Spread
│   └── Use Momentum
├── Calculate Volume Weight
│   └── Compute Sum of Volumes over a window (e.g., 10 days)
└── Final Alpha Construction
    └── Formula: (Combined Intraday and Reversal Signals) + (High-Low Momentum * Volume Weight) + (Multiply 5-Day Average High-Low Spread by Momentum) + 10-Day EMA of High-Low Spread
