Alpha Mining: Generate Novel and Interpretable Alpha Factors for Predicting Future Stock Returns
- Price-Based Indicators
  - Moving Averages
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices over 20 days
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices over 12 days
  - Momentum Indicators
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI) using 14-day period
    - Rate of Change (ROC) using 9-day period
  - Volume Weighted Indicators
    - Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) calculated on a daily basis
    - Volume Oscillator, difference between 30-day and 10-day SMA of Volume
- Volatility Indicators
  - Historical Volatility (HV) computed with close prices over the past 20 days
  - Bollinger Bands (BB) around 20-day SMA, with 2 standard deviations
- Trend Following Indicators
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) using 12, 26, and 9 day periods
  - Average Directional Index (ADX) to measure trend strength, using 14-day period
- Pattern Recognition in Prices
  - Candlestick Patterns
    - Bullish/Bearish Engulfing patterns identification
    - Doji patterns detection
  - Support and Resistance Levels
    - Identification of key support and resistance levels based on historical price data
- Custom Combined Indicators
  - Combination of EMA and RSI
    - When EMA(12) > EMA(26) and RSI < 30, signal potential undervaluation
  - Integration of VWAP and ROC
    - If stock price is above VWAP and ROC indicates positive momentum, consider it as a bullish signal
- Advanced Technical Indicators
  - Ichimoku Cloud
    - Components: Conversion Line (9), Base Line (26), Leading Span A and B (52)
  - Keltner Channel
    - Central line: 20-period EMA; upper and lower bands: 2x ATR
- Machine Learning Based Approach
  - Decision Trees
    - Train a decision tree model to classify next day's return as up or down using features like SMA, RSI, etc.
  - Random Forest
    - Ensemble method to predict future returns, combining multiple decision trees' predictions
- Unusual Activity Detection
  - Large Volume Spikes
    - Detect and flag occurrences when volume spikes compared to recent average
  - Extreme Price Movements
    - Identify instances where daily price change is more than two standard deviations from the mean
- Sentiment Analysis
  - News Articles
    - Analyze sentiment of news articles related to the company and correlate with stock performance
