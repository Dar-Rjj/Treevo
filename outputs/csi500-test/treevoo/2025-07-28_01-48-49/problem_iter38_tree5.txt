- Sub-Thought: Calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices over a 50-day period
- Sub-Thought: Introduce Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) based on closing prices over a 14-day period
- Sub-Thought: Evaluate the difference between the current day's close and the previous day's close to identify daily price movement
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Aggregate daily price movements into a cumulative sum over the past 20 days
- Sub-Thought: Measure the ratio of the current day's volume to the SMA of volume over a 20-day period for assessing recent trading activity
- Sub-Thought: Investigate the relationship between high and low prices to calculate a volatility measure
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Compute the true range (the maximum of the absolute value of today’s high minus today’s low, the absolute value of today’s high minus yesterday’s close, and the absolute value of today’s low minus yesterday’s close)
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Average the true range over the last 14 days to gauge short-term volatility
- Sub-Thought: Analyze price gaps by calculating the difference between the current day's open and the previous day's close
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Tally the number of up-gaps (positive differences) and down-gaps (negative differences) in the past month
- Sub-Thought: Examine the impact of volume spikes by identifying days where the volume is more than two standard deviations above the 30-day SMA of volume
- Sub-Thought: Explore momentum by looking at the rate of change (ROC) between the current close and the close from 10 days ago
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate the accumulation/distribution line to track buying and selling pressure
