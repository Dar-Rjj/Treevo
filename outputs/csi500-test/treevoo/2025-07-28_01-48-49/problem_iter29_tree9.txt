- Calculate daily return factors
  - Compute daily returns as (close_t - close_{t-1}) / close_{t-1}
- Explore price-based alpha factors
  - Calculate the difference between high and low prices as high - low
  - Compute the ratio of close to open prices as close / open
- Analyze trading activity with volume
  - Calculate the change in volume from the previous day as volume_t - volume_{t-1}
  - Compute the ratio of volume to close price as volume / close
- Investigate momentum and trend following
  - Calculate the moving average of closing prices over a short period (e.g., 5 days) and subtract it from the current close
  - Compute the moving average of closing prices over a long period (e.g., 20 days) and subtract it from the current close
- Examine volatility and risk
  - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a certain period (e.g., 10 days)
- Consider breakout and reversal patterns
  - Identify if the close price is above the high of the previous n days (e.g., 5 days)
  - Determine if the close price is below the low of the previous n days (e.g., 5 days)
- Evaluate the relationship between amount and volume
  - Calculate the ratio of amount to volume as amount / volume
  - Compute the change in this ratio from the previous day
- Analyze the impact of gaps
  - Determine if there is an up-gap by checking if open_t > close_{t-1}
  - Determine if there is a down-gap by checking if open_t < close_{t-1}
- Adjusted Intraday Price Movement
  - (High - Low) / (Open - Prev_Open)
- Weight by Volume and Close Difference
  - (Volume * (Close - Prev_Close))
  - (Adjusted Intraday Price Movement * (Volume * (Close - Prev_Close)))
- Intraday Volatility
  - Moving Average of (High - Low) over 20 days
- Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
  - (Close - Open) / Open
- Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
  - (Amount * Adjusted Intraday Price Movement) + (Volume * Close-to-Open Reversal Signal)
- Combine Enhanced Factors
  - (Weighted Intraday Price Movement * Volume-Weighted Return) + (Intraday Volatility * Volume-Weighted Return)
- Adjusted Momentum
  - (Close - 10-day Moving Average of Close) * Intraday Volatility
- Final Alpha Factor
  - (0.3 * Adjusted Intraday Price Movement) + (0.3 * Intraday Volatility) + (0.4 * Adjusted Momentum) * 0.5
  - (Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal * 0.5)
