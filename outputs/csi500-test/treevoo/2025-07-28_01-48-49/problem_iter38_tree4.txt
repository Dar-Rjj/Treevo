Thought: Synthesize Momentum, Volume, and Volatility for Enhanced Alpha Factors with Intraday Adjustments
- Sub-thought: Calculate Simple Moving Averages
  - Leaf: SMA(5) = Average of the last 5 days' closing prices
  - Leaf: SMA(20) = Average of the last 20 days' closing prices
- Sub-thought: Compare Short-term and Long-term Momentum
  - Leaf: Momentum Difference = SMA(5) - SMA(20)
  - Leaf: Momentum Direction = 1 if (SMA(5) > SMA(20)), -1 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Recent Price Changes
  - Leaf: Price Change = Close(t) - Open(t)
  - Leaf: Percentage Change = (Close(t) - Open(t)) / Open(t)
- Sub-thought: Analyze Volume Patterns
  - Leaf: Volume Ratio = Volume(t) / Average Volume of the last 20 days
  - Leaf: Volume Trend = 1 if (Volume(t) > Volume(t-1)), -1 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Combine Volume and Price Data
  - Leaf: Volume Adjusted Price Change = Price Change * Volume Ratio
  - Leaf: Volume Adjusted Momentum = Momentum Difference * Volume Ratio
- Sub-thought: Calculate Intraday Volatility
  - Leaf: Daily Range = High(t) - Low(t)
  - Leaf: Relative Range = Daily Range / Close(t)
- Sub-thought: Assess Historical Volatility
  - Leaf: Average Daily Range = Average of the last 20 days' daily ranges
  - Leaf: Volatility Spike = 1 if (Daily Range > 1.5 * Average Daily Range), 0 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Combine Momentum, Volume, and Volatility
  - Leaf: Momentum-Volatility Score = Momentum Difference * (1 + Volatility Spike)
  - Leaf: Comprehensive Alpha Factor = (Momentum Direction * Volume Adjusted Price Change) + (Relative Range * Volume Ratio)
- Sub-thought: Create a Hybrid Factor Based on Multiple Indicators
  - Leaf: Multi-Indicator Alpha = (Momentum Difference * Volume Ratio * Volatility Spike) + (Price Change * Volume Trend)
- Sub-thought: Incorporate High and Low Prices into Momentum and Volume
  - Leaf: High-Low Momentum = (High(t) - Low(t)) * Momentum Direction
  - Leaf: Volume Adjusted High-Low Momentum = High-Low Momentum * Volume Ratio
- Sub-thought: Generate a Compound Alpha Factor
  - Leaf: Compound Alpha = (Momentum-Volatility Score * Volume Adjusted High-Low Momentum) + (Comprehensive Alpha Factor * Multi-Indicator Alpha)
- Sub-thought: Refine Alpha Factors with Price and Volume Interaction
  - Leaf: Volume-Weighted Momentum = (SMA(5) - SMA(20)) * Volume Ratio
  - Leaf: Dynamic Alpha Factor = (Volume-Weighted Momentum * Momentum Direction) + (Relative Range * Volume Adjusted Price Change)
- Sub-thought: Calculate Intraday Price Movement
  - Leaf: Intraday Price Movement = (High(t) - Low(t)) / (Open(t) - Close(t-1))
- Sub-thought: Weight by Volume and Close Difference
  - Leaf: Close Difference = Close(t) - Close(t-1)
  - Leaf: Volume-Weighted Intraday Price Movement = Intraday Price Movement * (Volume(t) * Close Difference)
- Sub-thought: Integrate Intraday Volatility
  - Leaf: 20-day Moving Average of Daily Ranges
- Sub-thought: Incorporate Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
  - Leaf: Reversal Signal = (Close(t) - Open(t)) / Open(t)
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume-Weighted Return
  - Leaf: Volume-Weighted Return = Volume(t) * Reversal Signal
- Sub-thought: Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
  - Leaf: Intraday Return Weight = Volume(t)
  - Leaf: Reversal Signal Weight = Amount(t)
  - Leaf: Weighted Intraday and Reversal = (Intraday Return Weight * Intraday Return) + (Reversal Signal Weight * Reversal Signal)
- Sub-thought: Combine Enhanced Factors
  - Leaf: Combined Enhanced Factor = (Volume-Weighted Intraday Price Movement * 20-day Moving Average of Daily Ranges) * Volume-Weighted Return
- Sub-thought: Adjust by Average Volume
  - Leaf: 40-day Moving Average of Volume
  - Leaf: Adjusted Enhanced Factor = Combined Enhanced Factor / 40-day Moving Average of Volume
- Sub-thought: Incorporate Close
