Thought: Explore Momentum and Volatility Factors for Predictive Power
- Thought: Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossovers
  - Sub-Thought: SMA_50 Day Crossing SMA_200 Day
    - Action: If SMA(50, close) > SMA(200, close), then positive signal; else negative signal.
  - Sub-Thought: SMA_10 Day Crossing SMA_30 Day
    - Action: If SMA(10, close) > SMA(30, close), then positive signal; else negative signal.
- Thought: Integrate Price Movement and Volume Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: Identify High Volume Breakouts
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Above Resistance Level
      - Action: If (close > previous_high AND volume > avg(volume, 20)), then positive signal.
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Below Support Level
      - Action: If (close < previous_low AND volume > avg(volume, 20)), then negative signal.
  - Sub-Thought: Examine Relative Strength Index (RSI) with Volume Adjustments
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: RSI on Close Prices
      - Action: Calculate RSI(14, close). If RSI > 70, overbought condition; if RSI < 30, oversold condition.
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Volume-Adjusted RSI
      - Action: Calculate RSI(14, close * (volume / mean(volume, 20))). Use same thresholds as above.
- Thought: Investigate Intraday Trading Patterns
  - Sub-Thought: Detect Reversal Patterns
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Bullish Engulfing
      - Action: If (day t: low > day t-1: close AND day t: high < day t-1: open AND day t: close > day t: open), then bullish signal.
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Bearish Engulfing
      - Action: If (day t: high < day t-1: close AND day t: low > day t-1: open AND day t: close < day t: open), then bearish signal.
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze Candlestick Doji Patterns
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Long-Legged Doji Indicating Market Uncertainty
      - Action: If (day t: close ≈ day t: open AND (day t: high - day t: low) is large), then neutral but cautious signal.
- Thought: Consider ATR and ADX for Trend Strength and Direction
  - Sub-Thought: Apply Average True Range (ATR) for Volatility
    - Action: Calculate ATR(14, [high, low, close]). Higher ATR indicates higher volatility, which can precede trend continuation or reversal.
  - Sub-Thought: Use ADX for Trend Confirmation
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: ADX Line Increasing
      - Action: If ADX(14, [high, low, close]) is increasing, trend is strengthening.
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: DI+ and DI- Crossover
      - Action: If DI+ crosses above DI-, bullish trend; if DI- crosses above DI+, bearish trend.
