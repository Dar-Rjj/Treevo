Performing alpha mining to generate novel and interpretable alpha factors for predicting future stock returns
- Construct momentum factor
  - Calculate the percentage change in closing price over different time periods (e.g., 5, 20, 60 days)
- Design volatility measures
  - Compute the standard deviation of daily log-returns over different windows (e.g., 5, 20, 60 days)
- Incorporate volume-based indicators
  - Calculate the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume over a certain period (e.g., 20 days)
- Explore price action patterns
  - Identify bullish or bearish candlestick patterns over the last n days (e.g., engulfing, doji)
  - Quantify the pattern by assigning a score based on its strength and frequency
- Develop trend-following signals
  - Determine the difference between the current close and a moving average (e.g., 20-day SMA)
  - Assign a score based on the position of the close relative to the moving average (above: positive, below: negative)
- Create liquidity-related factors
  - Measure the spread between high and low prices as an indicator of intraday volatility
  - Analyze the relationship between trade volume and this spread
- Examine market sentiment
  - Calculate the cumulative sum of up and down days over a defined period (e.g., last 20 trading days)
  - Derive a sentiment score by comparing the number of up days to down days
