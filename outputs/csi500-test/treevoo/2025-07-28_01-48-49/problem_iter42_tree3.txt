Synthesized Alpha Factor with Enhanced Intraday Dynamics and Momentum Adjustments
├── Calculate Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
│   └── Divide by (Current Day's Open - Previous Day's Close)
├── Weight by Volume and Close Difference
│   ├── Calculate Close Difference (Close - Previous Day's Close)
│   └── Multiply Intraday Price Movement by (Volume * Close Difference)
├── Integrate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Compute Daily Range (High - Low)
│   └── Compute 20-day Moving Average of Daily Ranges
├── Incorporate Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
│   ├── Formula: (Close - Open) / Open
├── Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
│   ├── Intraday Return Weight: Amount
│   └── Reversal Signal Weight: Volume
│   └── Formula: (Amount * Intraday Price Movement) + (Volume * Reversal Signal)
├── Combine Enhanced Factors
│   ├── Use Weighted Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Use Intraday Volatility
│   └── Multiply Both with Volume-Weighted Return
├── Adjust by Average Volume
│   ├── Calculate 30-day Moving Average of Volume
│   └── Divide Combined Factor by Average Volume
├── Incorporate Close Price Momentum
│   ├── Calculate 30-day Moving Average of Close price
├── Adjust Momentum by Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Multiply Momentum by Intraday Volatility
├── Final Factor Calculation
    ├── Add (0.6 * Adjusted Intraday Price Movement) + (0.2 * Intraday Volatility) + (0.2 * Adjusted Momentum)
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── (Combined Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum * 0.8) + (Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal * 0.2)
