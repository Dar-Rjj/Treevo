├── Calculate Adjusted Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
│   └── Divide by Opening Price Difference
│       ├── Use Current Day's Open price
│       └── Subtract from Previous Day's Open price
├── Weight by Volume and Close Difference
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Calculate Close Difference
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Subtract from Previous Day's Close price
│   └── Multiply Adjusted Intraday Price Movement by (Volume * Close Difference)
├── Integrate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Compute Daily Range (High - Low)
│   └── Compute Moving Average of Daily Ranges
│       └── Define Lookback Period (e.g., 20 days)
├── Incorporate Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
│   ├── Use Open Price
│   ├── Use Close Price
│   └── Formula: (Close - Open) / Open
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Return
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
├── Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
│   ├── Intraday Return Weight
│   │   └── Use Amount
│   └── Reversal Signal Weight
│       └── Use Volume
│   └── Formula: (Weighted Intraday Return * Intraday Return) + (Reversal Weight * Reversal Signal)
├── Combine Enhanced Factors
│   ├── Use Weighted Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Use Intraday Volatility
│   └── Multiply Both with Volume-Weighted Return
├── Explore the Relationship Between Price Patterns and Future Returns
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Range
│   │   └── Use Intraday Range as a Direct Measure of Volatility
│   └── Analyze Open-to-Close Price Movement
│       └── Calculate Daily Momentum: (Close - Open) / Open
├── Investigate the Impact of Volume on Price Movements
│   ├── Measure the Ratio of Closing Price to Average Volume
│   │   └── Compute the Ratio of the Closing Price to the Sum of Volumes over a Short Period (e.g., 5 or 10 days)
│   └── Examine the Change in Volume Compared to Previous Periods
│       └── Calculate the Percentage Change in Volume from the Previous Day
├── Consider Multi-Day Price and Volume Trends
│   ├── Develop a Moving Sum of Daily Returns Over a Given Period
│   │   └── Sum the Daily Returns Over a 20-Day Period to Identify Medium-Term Performance
│   └── Evaluate the Trend of Volume Over a Series of Days
│       └── Compute the Moving Average of Volume Over a Specific Period (e.g., 10 days)
├── Combine Different Factors to Form a Composite Alpha Factor
│   ├── Weight the Individual Factors Based on Their Historical Correlation with Future Returns
│   │   └── Assign Weights to the Intraday Range, Daily Momentum, and Volume-Based Factors
│   └── Aggregate the Weighted Factors into a Single Composite Score
│       └── Sum the Weighted Factors to Create a Final Alpha Factor
└── Final Factor Calculation
    ├── Combine Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum
    │   ├── Add (Weight of 0.3 * Adjusted Intraday Price Movement) to (Weight of 0.3 * Intraday Volatility) and (Weight of 0.4 * Adjusted Momentum)
    └── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── Use Combined Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum
        ├── Use Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
        └── Combine Combined Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum, and Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
            └── Formula: (Combined Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum * 0.5) + (Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal * 0.5)
