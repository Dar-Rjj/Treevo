Synthesized Alpha Factor Combining Intraday Dynamics, Volume-Adjusted Range, and Hybrid Momentum-Reversal
├── Calculate Adjusted Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
│   └── Divide by (Current Day's Open - Previous Day's Open)
├── Weight by Volume and Close Difference
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Calculate Close Difference (Close - Previous Day's Close)
│   └── Multiply Adjusted Intraday Price Movement by (Volume * Close Difference)
├── Integrate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Compute Daily Range (High - Low)
│   └── Compute 20-day Moving Average of Daily Ranges
├── Incorporate Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
│   ├── Formula: (Close - Open) / Open
├── Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
│   ├── Intraday Return Weight: Amount
│   └── Reversal Signal Weight: Volume
│   └── Formula: (Amount * Adjusted Intraday Price Movement) + (Volume * Reversal Signal)
├── Combine Enhanced Factors
│   ├── Add Weighted Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Add Intraday Volatility
│   └── Multiply Both with Volume-Weighted Return
├── Final Factor Calculation
    ├── Combine (Combined Enhanced Factors * 0.6) + (Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal * 0.4)
