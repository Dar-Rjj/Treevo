Synthesized Alpha Factor from Price and Volume Dynamics
├── Calculate Dynamic Price Differences
│   ├── Use High and Low Prices to Identify Intraday Movement
│   │   ├── Subtract Low price from High price to get Daily Range
│   │   └── Consider High price as the peak and Low price as the trough
│   └── Calculate Open-to-Open Difference
│       ├── Use Open price of the current day
│       └── Use Open price of the previous day
├── Aggregate Price Difference with Volume
│   ├── Apply Weight by Volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume of the current day
│   │   └── Multiply Volume by the Open-to-Open Difference
│   └── Calculate Sum of Weighted Differences
│       ├── Sum the volume-weighted Open-to-Open differences
│       └── Consider a Rolling Window to Capture Trend (e.g., 5 days)
├── Enhance with Smoothed Moving Average Filter
│   ├── Calculate Simple Moving Average of Weighted Sums
│   │   ├── Use the Sum of Weighted Differences
│   │   └── Define a Smoothing Factor (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Finalize Alpha Factor
│       ├── Use the SMA of Weighted Sums
│       └── Adjust for Volatility Impact
│           ├── Use Average True Range as a Proxy for Volatility
│           │   ├── Calculate ATR over a defined period (e.g., 14 days)
│           │   └── Compute the average of the True Ranges
│           └── Divide the Alpha Factor by ATR
└── Combine with High-to-Low Movement Relative to Open
    ├── Calculate High-to-Low Movement
    │   ├── Use High price
    │   └── Use Low price
    ├── Calculate Open Adjustment Factor
    │   ├── Use Open price
    │   └── Calculate Opening Price Difference
    │       ├── Use Previous Day's Open price
    │       └── Subtract from Current Open price
    ├── Adjust High-to-Low Movement by Open Adjustment
    │   ├── Use High-to-Low Movement
    │   └── Divide by Opening Price Difference
    └── Weight by Volume and Close Difference
        ├── Use Volume
        ├── Calculate Close Difference
        │   ├── Use Close price
        │   └── Subtract from Previous Day's Close price
        └── Multiply Adjusted High-to-Low Movement by (Volume * Close Difference)
└── Final Composite Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine the Enhanced Alpha Factor with the High-to-Low Movement Component
    ├── Add the two factors together
    └── Ensure the result is interpretable and coherent
