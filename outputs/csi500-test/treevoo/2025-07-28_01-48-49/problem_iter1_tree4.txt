Advanced Volume-Weighted Price Trend Indicator
├── Calculate Dynamic Price Difference
│   ├── Use High and Low Prices to Identify Intraday Movement
│   │   ├── Subtract Low price from High price to get Daily Range
│   │   └── Consider High price as the peak and Low price as the trough
│   └── Calculate Close-to-Open Difference
│       ├── Use Close price of the current day
│       └── Use Open price of the next day
├── Aggregate Price Difference with Volume
│   ├── Apply Weight by Volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume of the current day
│   │   └── Multiply Volume by the Close-to-Open Difference
│   └── Calculate Sum of Weighted Differences
│       ├── Sum the volume-weighted Close-to-Open differences
│       └── Consider a Rolling Window to Capture Trend (e.g., 5 days)
└── Enhance with Smoothed Moving Average Filter
    ├── Calculate Simple Moving Average of Weighted Sums
    │   ├── Use the Sum of Weighted Differences
    │   └── Define a Smoothing Factor (e.g., 10 days)
    └── Finalize Alpha Factor
        ├── Use the SMA of Weighted Sums
        └── Adjust for Volatility Impact
            ├── Use Average True Range as a Proxy for Volatility
            │   ├── Calculate ATR over a defined period (e.g., 14 days)
            │   └── Compute the average of the True Ranges
            └── Normalize the Alpha Factor by Dividing by ATR
                └── This step helps in adjusting the factor's sensitivity to market volatility
