Thought: Develop Momentum-based Alpha Factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate Simple Moving Averages
  - Leaf: SMA(5) = Average of the last 5 days' closing prices
  - Leaf: SMA(20) = Average of the last 20 days' closing prices
- Sub-thought: Compare Short-term and Long-term Momentum
  - Leaf: Momentum Difference = SMA(5) - SMA(20)
  - Leaf: Momentum Direction = 1 if (SMA(5) > SMA(20)), -1 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Recent Price Changes
  - Leaf: Price Change = Close(t) - Open(t)
  - Leaf: Percentage Change = (Close(t) - Open(t)) / Open(t)

Thought: Incorporate Volume into Alpha Factors
- Sub-thought: Analyze Volume Patterns
  - Leaf: Volume Ratio = Volume(t) / Average Volume of the last 20 days
  - Leaf: Volume Trend = 1 if (Volume(t) > Volume(t-1)), -1 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Combine Volume and Price Data
  - Leaf: Volume Adjusted Price Change = Price Change * Volume Ratio
  - Leaf: Volume Adjusted Momentum = Momentum Difference * Volume Ratio

Thought: Utilize High and Low Prices for Volatility Measures
- Sub-thought: Calculate Intraday Volatility
  - Leaf: Daily Range = High(t) - Low(t)
  - Leaf: Relative Range = Daily Range / Close(t)
- Sub-thought: Assess Historical Volatility
  - Leaf: Average Daily Range = Average of the last 20 days' daily ranges
  - Leaf: Volatility Spike = 1 if (Daily Range > 1.5 * Average Daily Range), 0 otherwise

Thought: Generate Complex Alpha Factors from Basic Components
- Sub-thought: Combine Momentum, Volume, and Volatility
  - Leaf: Momentum-Volatility Score = Momentum Difference * (1 + Volatility Spike)
  - Leaf: Comprehensive Alpha Factor = (Momentum Direction * Volume Adjusted Price Change) + (Relative Range * Volume Ratio)
- Sub-thought: Create a Hybrid Factor Based on Multiple Indicators
  - Leaf: Multi-Indicator Alpha = (Momentum Difference * Volume Ratio * Volatility Spike) + (Price Change * Volume Trend)
