- Calculate price changes
  - Calculate daily price change: (close_t - close_{t-1}) / close_{t-1}
  - Calculate high-low range: high_t - low_t
  - Calculate open-close range: close_t - open_t
- Analyze volume and amount
  - Calculate daily volume change: (volume_t - volume_{t-1}) / volume_{t-1}
  - Calculate daily amount change: (amount_t - amount_{t-1}) / amount_{t-1}
  - Calculate volume-to-amount ratio: volume_t / amount_t
- Identify price patterns
  - Calculate moving average crossover: MA(close, short_window) - MA(close, long_window)
  - Calculate relative strength index (RSI): RSI(close, window)
  - Calculate Bollinger Bands: (close_t - MA(close, window)) / (2 * stddev(close, window))
- Analyze volatility
  - Calculate simple volatility: stddev(close, window)
  - Calculate average true range (ATR): ATR(high, low, close, window)
  - Calculate historical volatility: log(close_t / close_{t-1})
- Evaluate market sentiment
  - Calculate money flow index (MFI): MFI(high, low, close, volume, window)
  - Calculate Chaikin Oscillator: (MA(acumulation_distribution, short_window) - MA(acumulation_distribution, long_window))
- Combine factors
  - Combine multiple alpha factors using weighted sum: w1 * factor1 + w2 * factor2 + ... + wn * factorn
  - Use linear regression to combine factors: reg(factor1, factor2, ..., factorn)
  - Apply machine learning models to combine factors: model.fit(factor1, factor2, ..., factorn)
