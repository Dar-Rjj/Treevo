- Constructing Alpha Factors from Price and Volume Data
  - Momentum-based Factors
    - Simple Moving Average Crossover: Use the crossing of short-term (e.g., 5 days) and long-term (e.g., 20 days) simple moving averages as a signal for trend direction.
      - Calculate short-term SMA using close prices
      - Calculate long-term SMA using close prices
      - Generate a buy/sell signal based on the crossover of these two SMAs
    - Rate of Change (ROC): Measure the percentage change in price over a certain period, indicating the strength of a trend.
      - Calculate ROC using close prices over a specific lookback period
      - Use ROC to gauge the momentum or speed of the price movement
  - Volatility-based Factors
    - True Range: Assess the volatility of a stock by measuring the true range, which is the greatest of the following: current high less the current low, the absolute value of the current high less the previous close, and the absolute value of the current low less the previous close.
      - Compute the true range for each day
      - Use the average true range over a specific period to represent the level of market volatility
    - Average True Range (ATR): A smoothed version of the true range, providing a more stable measure of volatility.
      - Calculate ATR by averaging the true range over a longer period
      - Use ATR to set dynamic stop loss levels or to identify potential breakout opportunities
  - Volume-based Factors
    - On-Balance Volume (OBV): Relates changes in volume to price movements. It's used to confirm trends in the share price.
      - If the close price is higher than the previous close, add the current volume to OBV
      - If the close price is lower than the previous close, subtract the current volume from OBV
      - Flat if the close price equals the previous close
    - Volume Price Trend (VPT): Measures the cumulative sum of volume times the relative price change, indicating the balance between buying and selling pressure.
      - Calculate the daily ratio of the close price to the previous close
      - Multiply this ratio by the volume
      - Accumulate this product over time to form the VPT
  - Combined Factors
    - Price-Volume Divergence: Identify when price and an indicator like OBV or VPT are moving in opposite directions, potentially signaling a reversal.
      - Monitor the relationship between price and OBV/VPT
      - Generate signals when there is a divergence between the two
    - Bollinger Bands with Volume: Combine Bollinger Bands (a volatility channel based on standard deviations around a moving average) with volume to identify potential price reversals or continuation patterns.
      - Calculate the 20-day moving average of the close price
      - Calculate the upper and lower Bollinger Bands at 2 standard deviations from the moving average
      - Analyze the position of the close price relative to the Bollinger Bands and consider volume spikes to generate signals
