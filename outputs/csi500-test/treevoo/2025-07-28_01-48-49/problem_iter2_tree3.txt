Crossover of Advanced Volume-Weighted Price Trend Indicator and High Low Spread Momentum
├── Calculate Dynamic Price Difference and High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High and Low Prices to Identify Intraday Movement
│   │   ├── Subtract Low price from High price to get Daily Range
│   │   └── Consider High price as the peak and Low price as the trough
│   └── Calculate Close-to-Open Difference
│       ├── Use Close price of the current day
│       └── Use Open price of the next day
├── Aggregate Price Differences and High-Low Spreads with Volume
│   ├── Apply Weight by Volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume of the current day
│   │   └── Multiply Volume by the Close-to-Open Difference
│   └── Calculate Sum of Weighted Differences
│       ├── Sum the volume-weighted Close-to-Open differences
│       └── Consider a Rolling Window to Capture Trend (e.g., 5 days)
├── Enhance with Smoothed Moving Average Filter
│   ├── Calculate Simple Moving Average of Weighted Sums
│   │   ├── Use the Sum of Weighted Differences
│   │   └── Define a Smoothing Factor (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Finalize Alpha Factor
│       ├── Use the SMA of Weighted Sums
│       └── Adjust for Volatility Impact
│           ├── Use Average True Range as a Proxy for Volatility
│           │   ├── Calculate ATR over a defined period (e.g., 14 days)
│           │   └── Compute the average of the True Ranges
│           └── Divide the Alpha Factor by ATR
│               └── This step helps in adjusting the factor's sensitivity to market volatility
└── Incorporate Momentum
    ├── Calculate 5-Day Average High-Low Spread
    │   ├── Sum of High-Low Spreads over 5 days
    │   └── Divide by 5
    ├── Calculate Momentum
    │   ├── Use Close price of today
    │   ├── Use Close price of 5 days ago
    │   └── Subtract and divide by Close price of 5 days ago
    └── Combine Alpha Factor with Momentum
        ├── Use Finalized Alpha Factor
        └── Multiply by Momentum
            └── This step combines the trend and momentum signals
