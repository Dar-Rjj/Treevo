Synthesized Alpha Factor with Enhanced Intraday Dynamics, Momentum, and Volume-Based Indicators
├── Calculate Adjusted Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
│   └── Divide by (Current Day's Open - Previous Day's Close)
├── Weight by Volume and Close Difference
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Calculate Close Difference (Close - Previous Day's Close)
│   └── Multiply Adjusted Intraday Price Movement by (Volume * Close Difference)
├── Integrate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Compute Daily Range (High - Low)
│   └── Compute 20-day Exponential Moving Average of Daily Ranges
├── Incorporate Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
│   ├── Formula: (Close - Open) / Open
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Return
│   ├── Multiply Volume by Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
├── Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
│   ├── Intraday Return Weight: Amount
│   └── Reversal Signal Weight: Volume
│   └── Formula: (Amount * Adjusted Intraday Return) + (Volume * Reversal Signal)
├── Combine Enhanced Factors
│   ├── Use Weighted Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Use Intraday Volatility
│   └── Add Both to Volume-Weighted Return
├── Adjust by Relative Volume
│   ├── Calculate 20-day Exponential Moving Average of Volume

│   ├── Calculate 10-day Exponential Moving Average of Close price
│   └── Adjust Momentum by Intraday Volatility
│       ├── Multiply Momentum by Intraday Volatility
├── Construct Momentum Factor
│   ├── Calculate the percentage change in closing price over different time periods (e.g., 5, 20, 60 days)
├── Design Volatility Measures
│   ├── Compute the standard deviation of daily log-returns over different windows (e.g., 5, 20, 60 days)
├── Incorporate Volume-Based Indicators
│   ├── Calculate the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume over a certain period (e.g., 20 days)
├── Final Alpha Factor Calculation
    ├── Combine Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum
    │   ├── Add (0.55 * Adjusted Intraday Price Movement) + (0.225 * Intraday Volatility) + (0.225 * Adjusted Momentum)
    ├── Incorporate Momentum Factor, Volatility Measures, and Volume-Based Indicators
    │   ├── Add (0.2 * Momentum Factor) + (0.2 * Volatility Measures) + (0.2 * Volume-Based Indicators)
    ├── Final Alpha Factor
        ├── Combine (Combined Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum * 0.75) + (Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal * 0.25)
