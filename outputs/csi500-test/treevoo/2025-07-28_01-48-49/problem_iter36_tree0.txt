Alpha Mining for Predicting Future Stock Returns
- Technical Indicators
  - Moving Averages
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Price: Calculate the average close price over a defined period.
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Price: Apply an exponentially weighted average to the close prices, giving more weight to recent observations.
  - Momentum Indicators
    - Rate of Change (ROC) of Close Price: Calculate the percentage change in the close price from one period ago.
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Close Price: Measure the strength of the stock's recent performance by comparing the magnitude of its recent gains with its recent losses.
- Volume-Based Indicators
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV): Accumulate the volume on up days and subtract the volume on down days to measure buying and selling pressure.
  - Money Flow Index (MFI): Incorporate both price and volume to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
- Volatility Indicators
  - True Range (TR): For each period, calculate the maximum difference between the current high and low, the previous close and the current high, and the previous close and the current low.
  - Average True Range (ATR): Compute the moving average of the true range to measure market volatility.
- Breakout Indicators
  - High-Low Range: Observe the spread between the high and low prices as a potential signal for breakouts.
  - New Highs/New Lows: Track the occurrence of new highs and lows over a given period to gauge market trends.
- Trend Following Indicators
  - Directional Movement Index (DMI): Use the positive (+DI) and negative (-DI) directional indicators along with the ADX to quantify the strength of a trend.
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Subtract the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA, then compare this line with its 9-day EMA to spot trend changes and momentum shifts.
- Custom Indicators
  - Cumulative Sum of Daily Returns: Sum up the daily return values to observe long-term gain/loss trends.
  - Volume-Weighted Close: Calculate the sum of (close price * volume) divided by total volume to highlight periods of significant trading activity.
