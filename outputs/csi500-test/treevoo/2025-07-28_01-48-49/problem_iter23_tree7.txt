Thought: Derive Alpha Factors from Price and Volume Data
- Sub-Thought: Calculate Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the Rate of Change (ROC) over a 10-day period
    - Thought: ROC = (Close_t - Close_{t-10}) / Close_{t-10}
  - Sub-Thought: Determine the Directional Movement Index (DMI) over a 14-day period
    - Thought: Positive Directional Indicator (+DI) calculation
      - Thought: +DM = High_t - High_{t-1} if it is greater than 0, else 0
    - Thought: Negative Directional Indicator (-DI) calculation
      - Thought: -DM = Low_{t-1} - Low_t if it is greater than 0, else 0
    - Thought: Smoothed +DI and -DI over 14 days
    - Thought: DI Ratio = +DI / -DI
    - Thought: DMI = 100 * (DI Ratio - 1) / (DI Ratio + 1)
- Sub-Thought: Develop Volume-Based Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Thought: OBV_t = OBV_{t-1} + Volume_t if Close_t > Close_{t-1}, else OBV_{t-1} - Volume_t if Close_t < Close_{t-1}, else OBV_{t-1}
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D)
    - Thought: A/D_t = A/D_{t-1} + ((Close_t - Low_t) - (High_t - Close_t)) / (High_t - Low_t) * Volume_t
- Sub-Thought: Construct Complex Alpha Factors
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate Momentum with Volume Trends
    - Thought: Combine ROC and OBV for a hybrid alpha factor
      - Thought: HybridAlpha_1 = ROC * (OBV_t / OBV_{t-1})
  - Sub-Thought: Mix Directional Movement with Volume
    - Thought: Merge DMI and A/D for another composite indicator
      - Thought: CompositeAlpha_2 = DMI * (A/D_t / A/D_{t-1})
