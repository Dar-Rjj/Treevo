Volume-Adjusted Momentum, Enhanced High-Low Spread, and Open Price Impact with Intraday Volatility
├── Calculate Adjusted Range
│   ├── Intraday Price Range (High - Low)
│   └── Adjust by Average Volume (Moving Average over 20 days)
├── Calculate Close Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Determine Momentum (Close price today / Close price 5 days ago - 1)
├── Calculate 5-Day Average High-Low Spread
│   ├── Sum of High-Low Spreads over 5 days
│   └── Divide by 5
├── Calculate 10-Day EMA of High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High-Low Spread
│   └── Apply EMA with a 10-day span
├── Multiply 5-Day Average High-Low Spread by Momentum
│   ├── Use 5-Day Average High-Low Spread
│   └── Use Momentum
├── Add 10-Day EMA of High-Low Spread to 20-Day Price Return
│   ├── Use 10-Day EMA of High-Low Spread
│   └── Subtract and divide Close price of today by Close price of 20 days ago
├── Calculate Open Adjustment Factor
│   ├── Use Open price
│   └── Calculate Opening Price Difference (Current Open - Previous Day's Open)
├── Adjust High-to-Low Movement by Open Adjustment
│   ├── Use High-to-Low Movement
│   └── Divide by Opening Price Difference
├── Weight by Volume and Close Difference
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Calculate Close Difference (Close price - Previous Day's Close price)
│   └── Multiply Adjusted High-to-Low Movement by (Volume * Close Difference)
├── Integrate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Compute Daily Range (High - Low)
│   └── Compute Average of Daily Ranges
├── Incorporate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Use Open price
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Return
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
├── Calculate Open Price Impact
│   ├── Use Open price
│   └── Calculate Relative Open Price Change (Current Open / Previous Day's Open - 1)
└── Final Factor Calculation
    ├── Combine Adjusted Range, Momentum, and Enhanced Factors
    │   ├── Use Adjusted Range
    │   ├── Use Momentum
    │   ├── Use Weighted High-to-Low Movement
    │   ├── Use Intraday Volatility
    │   └── Use Volume-Weighted Return
    ├── Incorporate Open Price Impact
    │   ├── Use Relative Open Price Change
    ├── Add 10-Day EMA of High-Low Spread to 20-Day Price Return
    └── Assign Relative Weights
        ├── Weigh Adjusted Range (e.g., 0.20)
        ├── Weigh Momentum (e.g., 0.20)
        ├── Weigh Weighted High-to-Low Movement (e.g., 0.20)
        ├── Weigh Intraday Volatility (e.g., 0.15)
        ├── Weigh Volume-Weighted Return (e.g., 0.15)
        └── Weigh Open Price Impact (e.g., 0.10)
