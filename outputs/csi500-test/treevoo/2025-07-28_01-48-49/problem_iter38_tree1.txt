Thought: Synthesized Alpha Factor Combining Momentum, Volume, and Intraday Dynamics
- Sub-thought: Calculate Simple Moving Averages
  - Leaf: SMA(5) = Average of the last 5 days' closing prices
  - Leaf: SMA(20) = Average of the last 20 days' closing prices
- Sub-thought: Compare Short-term and Long-term Momentum
  - Leaf: Momentum Difference = SMA(5) - SMA(20)
  - Leaf: Momentum Direction = 1 if (SMA(5) > SMA(20)), -1 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Recent Price Changes
  - Leaf: Price Change = Close(t) - Open(t)
  - Leaf: Percentage Change = (Close(t) - Open(t)) / Open(t)
- Sub-thought: Analyze Volume Patterns
  - Leaf: Volume Ratio = Volume(t) / Average Volume of the last 20 days
  - Leaf: Volume Trend = 1 if (Volume(t) > Volume(t-1)), -1 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Calculate Intraday Volatility
  - Leaf: Daily Range = High(t) - Low(t)
  - Leaf: Relative Range = Daily Range / Close(t)
  - Leaf: Average Daily Range = Average of the last 20 days' daily ranges
  - Leaf: Volatility Spike = 1 if (Daily Range > 1.5 * Average Daily Range), 0 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Integrate Intraday Dynamics
  - Leaf: Adjusted Intraday Price Movement = (High(t) - Low(t)) / (Open(t) - Open(t-1))
  - Leaf: Weighted Intraday Price Movement = Adjusted Intraday Price Movement * (Volume(t) * (Close(t) - Close(t-1)))
- Sub-thought: Combine Volume and Price Data
  - Leaf: Volume Adjusted Price Change = Price Change * Volume Ratio
  - Leaf: Volume Adjusted Momentum = Momentum Difference * Volume Ratio
- Sub-thought: Incorporate High and Low Prices into Momentum and Volume
  - Leaf: High-Low Momentum = (High(t) - Low(t)) * Momentum Direction
  - Leaf: Volume Adjusted High-Low Momentum = High-Low Momentum * Volume Ratio
- Sub-thought: Generate a Compound Alpha Factor
  - Leaf: Momentum-Volatility Score = Momentum Difference * (1 + Volatility Spike)
  - Leaf: Comprehensive Alpha Factor = (Momentum Direction * Volume Adjusted Price Change) + (Relative Range * Volume Ratio)
  - Leaf: Multi-Indicator Alpha = (Momentum Difference * Volume Ratio * Volatility Spike) + (Price Change * Volume Trend)
  - Leaf: Compound Alpha = (Momentum-Volatility Score * Volume Adjusted High-Low Momentum) + (Comprehensive Alpha Factor * Multi-Indicator Alpha)
- Sub-thought: Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
  - Leaf: Reversal Signal = (Close(t) - Open(t)) / Open(t)
  - Leaf: Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal = (Amount * Adjusted Intraday Price Movement) + (Volume * Reversal Signal)
- Sub-thought: Refine Alpha Factors with Enhanced Combination
  - Leaf: Combined Enhanced Factors = (Weighted Intraday Price Movement + Daily Range) * (Volume * (Close(t) - Close(t-1)))
  - Leaf: Final Factor = (Combined Enhanced Factors * 0.6) + (Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal * 0.4)
