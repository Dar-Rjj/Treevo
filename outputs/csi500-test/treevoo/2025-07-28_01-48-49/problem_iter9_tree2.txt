Synthesized Alpha Factor Combining High-to-Low Movement, Intraday Volatility, and Volume-Weighted Price Momentum
├── Calculate Dynamic Price Movement and Intraday Swing
│   ├── Use High and Low Prices to Identify Intraday Swing
│   │   ├── Subtract Low price from High price to get Daily Range
│   │   └── Consider High price as the peak and Low price as the trough
│   └── Calculate Close-to-Next-Open Difference
│       ├── Use Close price of the current day
│       └── Use Open price of the next day
├── Adjust High-to-Low Movement by Open Adjustment
│   ├── Use High-to-Low Movement
│   └── Divide by Opening Price Difference
│       ├── Use Current Day's Open price
│       └── Subtract Previous Day's Open price
├── Weight by Volume and Close Difference
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Calculate Close Difference
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Subtract from Previous Day's Close price
│   └── Multiply Adjusted High-to-Low Movement by (Volume * Close Difference)
├── Aggregate Price Movement with Volume
│   ├── Apply Weight by Volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume of the current day
│   │   └── Multiply Volume by the Close-to-Next-Open Difference
│   └── Calculate Sum of Weighted Differences
│       ├── Sum the volume-weighted Close-to-Next-Open differences
│       └── Consider a Rolling Window to Capture Trend (e.g., 5 days)
├── Enhance with Exponential Moving Average Filter
│   ├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average of Weighted Sums
│   │   ├── Use the Sum of Weighted Differences
│   │   └── Define a Smoothing Factor (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Finalize Alpha Factor
│       ├── Use the EMA of Weighted Sums
│       └── Adjust for Volatility Impact
│           ├── Use Standard Deviation of Returns as a Proxy for Volatility
│           │   ├── Calculate Standard Deviation over a defined period (e.g., 14 days)
│           │   └── Compute the standard deviation of daily returns
│           └── Normalize the Alpha Factor by Dividing by Standard Deviation
└── Combine Enhanced Factors
    ├── Use Weighted High-to-Low Movement
    ├── Use Intraday Volatility
    │   ├── Compute Daily Range (High - Low)
    │   └── Compute Average of Daily Ranges
    └── Incorporate Volume-Weighted Return
        ├── Use Volume
        └── Multiply by Close-to-Open Return
    └── Integrate Price Trend Indicator
        ├── Calculate Simple Moving Average of Close Prices
        │   ├── Use Close prices
        │   └── Define a Period (e.g., 20 days)
        └── Evaluate Trend Direction
            ├── Compare Current Close Price with SMA
            └── Assign Positive or Negative Value Based on Comparison
