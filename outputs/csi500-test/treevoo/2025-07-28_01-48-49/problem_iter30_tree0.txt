- Calculate daily return factors
  - Compute daily returns as (close_t - close_{t-1}) / close_{t-1}
- Explore price-based alpha factors
  - Calculate the difference between high and low prices as high - low
  - Compute the ratio of close to open prices as close / open
  - Calculate the average of high, low, and close prices as (high + low + close) / 3
- Analyze trading activity with volume
  - Calculate the change in volume from the previous day as volume_t - volume_{t-1}
  - Compute the ratio of volume to close price as volume / close
  - Calculate the average volume over the past 5 days and subtract it from the current volume
- Investigate momentum and trend following
  - Calculate the moving average of closing prices over a short period (e.g., 5 days) and subtract it from the current close
  - Compute the moving average of closing prices over a long period (e.g., 20 days) and subtract it from the current close
  - Calculate the moving average of daily returns over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
- Examine volatility and risk
  - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a certain period (e.g., 10 days)
  - Calculate the sum of absolute daily returns over a certain period (e.g., 10 days)
- Consider breakout and reversal patterns
  - Identify if the close price is above the high of the previous n days (e.g., 5 days)
  - Determine if the close price is below the low of the previous n days (e.g., 5 days)
  - Calculate the number of days the close price has been above the short-term moving average
- Evaluate the relationship between amount and volume
  - Calculate the ratio of amount to volume as amount / volume
  - Compute the change in this ratio from the previous day
  - Calculate the average amount over the past 5 days and subtract it from the current amount
- Analyze the impact of gaps
  - Determine if there is an up-gap by checking if open_t > close_{t-1}
  - Determine if there is a down-gap by checking if open_t < close_{t-1}
  - Calculate the size of the gap as the absolute value of (open_t - close_{t-1})
