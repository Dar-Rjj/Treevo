Thought: Begin with core financial indicators and their dynamic variations
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the weighted moving average (WMA) of closing prices over a 50-day period
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Introduce a second WMA using a 200-day period to compare long-term trends
- Sub-Thought: Introduce relative strength indicator (RSI) based on closing prices over a 14-day period
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Incorporate an additional RSI line based on the WMA of closing prices to identify divergences
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Add a third RSI line using a 28-day period to capture medium-term momentum
- Sub-Thought: Evaluate the difference between the current day's close and the previous day's close to identify daily price movement
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Aggregate daily price movements into a cumulative sum over the past 20 days
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Compute the average daily price movement over the last 20 days to identify trends
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Calculate the standard deviation of daily price movements over the last 20 days to measure volatility
- Sub-Thought: Measure the ratio of the current day's volume to the SMA of volume over a 20-day period for assessing recent trading activity
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Introduce a momentum factor by calculating the rate of change in volume over the last 20 days
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Compute the average volume over the past 50 days and use it to normalize the current day's volume
- Sub-Thought: Investigate the relationship between high and low prices to calculate a volatility measure
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Compute the true range (the maximum of the absolute value of today’s high minus today’s low, the absolute value of today’s high minus yesterday’s close, and the absolute value of today’s low minus yesterday’s close)
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Average the true range over the last 14 days to gauge short-term volatility
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Calculate the average true range over the last 50 days for a longer-term volatility measure
- Sub-Thought: Analyze price gaps by calculating the difference between the current day's open and the previous day's close
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Tally the number of up-gaps (positive differences) and down-gaps (negative differences) in the past month
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Calculate the average size of up-gaps and down-gaps separately over the past month
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Determine the total gap size (sum of up-gaps and down-gaps) over the past month
- Sub-Thought: Explore momentum by looking at the rate of change (ROC) between the current close and the close from 10 days ago
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Introduce a dual ROC calculation using both 10-day and 20-day periods to capture short and medium-term momentum
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Add a third ROC calculation using a 60-day period to capture long-term momentum
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate the accumulation/distribution line to track buying and selling pressure
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Adjust the formula to use the median of high, low, and close instead of the closing price for a modified A/D line
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Compute the rate of change of the modified A/D line over the last 20 days to identify changes in buying/selling pressure
  - Sub-sub-Thought: Introduce a second A/D line using the mode of high, low, and close for a different perspective on buying and selling pressure
