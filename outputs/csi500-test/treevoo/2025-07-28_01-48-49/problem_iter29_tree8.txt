- Calculate daily return factors
  - Compute daily returns as (close_t - close_{t-1}) / close_{t-1}
- Explore price-based alpha factors
  - Calculate the difference between high and low prices as high - low
  - Compute the ratio of close to open prices as close / open
- Analyze trading activity with volume
  - Calculate the change in volume from the previous day as volume_t - volume_{t-1}
  - Compute the ratio of volume to close price as volume / close
- Investigate momentum and trend following
  - Calculate the moving average of closing prices over a short period (e.g., 5 days) and subtract it from the current close
  - Compute the moving average of closing prices over a long period (e.g., 20 days) and subtract it from the current close
- Examine volatility and risk
  - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a certain period (e.g., 10 days)
- Consider breakout and reversal patterns
  - Identify if the close price is above the high of the previous n days (e.g., 5 days)
  - Determine if the close price is below the low of the previous n days (e.g., 5 days)
- Evaluate the relationship between amount and volume
  - Calculate the ratio of amount to volume as amount / volume
  - Compute the change in this ratio from the previous day
- Analyze the impact of gaps
  - Determine if there is an up-gap by checking if open_t > close_{t-1}
  - Determine if there is a down-gap by checking if open_t < close_{t-1}
- Synthesize Alpha Factor Combining Intraday Dynamics, Volume-Adjusted Range, and Hybrid Momentum-Reversal
  - Calculate Adjusted Intraday Price Movement
    - Subtract Low price from High price
    - Divide by (Current Day's Open - Previous Day's Open)
  - Weight by Volume and Close Difference
    - Use Volume
    - Calculate Close Difference (Close - Previous Day's Close)
    - Multiply Adjusted Intraday Price Movement by (Volume * Close Difference)
  - Integrate Intraday Volatility
    - Compute Daily Range (High - Low)
    - Compute 20-day Moving Average of Daily Ranges
  - Incorporate Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
    - Formula: (Close - Open) / Open
  - Calculate Volume-Weighted Return
    - Multiply Volume by Close-to-Open Reversal Signal
  - Construct Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal
    - Intraday Return Weight: Amount
    - Reversal Signal Weight: Volume
    - Formula: (Amount * Adjusted Intraday Return) + (Volume * Reversal Signal)
  - Combine Enhanced Factors
    - Use Weighted Intraday Price Movement
    - Use Intraday Volatility
    - Multiply Both with Volume-Weighted Return
  - Adjust by Average Volume
    - Calculate 20-day Moving Average of Volume
    - Divide Combined Factor by Average Volume
  - Incorporate Close Price Momentum
    - Calculate 10-day Moving Average of Close price
  - Adjust Momentum by Intraday Volatility
    - Multiply Momentum by Intraday Volatility
  - Final Factor Calculation
    - Combine Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum
      - Add (0.3 * Adjusted Intraday Price Movement) + (0.3 * Intraday Volatility) + (0.4 * Adjusted Momentum)
    - Final Alpha Factor
      - Combine (Combined Adjusted Range, Volatility, and Adjusted Momentum * 0.5) + (Weighted Intraday Return and Reversal Signal * 0.5)
