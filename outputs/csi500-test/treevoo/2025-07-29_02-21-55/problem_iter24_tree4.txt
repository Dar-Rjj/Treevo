Thought: Develop a momentum-based alpha factor using closing prices.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing price over the past 50 days.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Use the SMA as a signal to buy (when close > SMA) or sell (when close < SMA).
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) of the closing price over the past 20 days.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Combine the EMA with the SMA to create a dual-moving-average crossover strategy for signaling buy/sell.

Thought: Create a volatility-based alpha factor using high and low prices.
    Sub-Thought: Compute the daily range by subtracting the low from the high.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Sum the daily ranges over the past 30 days to get a rolling volatility measure.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over the past 14 days.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Use the ATR as an indicator to enter or exit trades, with higher ATR suggesting increased market volatility and potential for larger price movements.

Thought: Generate a volume-based alpha factor.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) by summing the volume on up days and subtracting volume on down days.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Analyze OBV trends to identify potential buying or selling pressure.
    Sub-Sub-Thought: Use the OBV in conjunction with price changes to confirm the direction of the trend.

Thought: Explore a combination of price and volume to create a hybrid alpha factor.
    Sub-Thought: Compute the money flow index (MFI) by dividing the total positive money flow by the total negative money flow.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Use the MFI to identify overbought (MFI > 80) or oversold (MFI < 20) conditions.
    Sub-Sub-Thought: Integrate the MFI with other factors like SMA and EMA to refine trading signals.
