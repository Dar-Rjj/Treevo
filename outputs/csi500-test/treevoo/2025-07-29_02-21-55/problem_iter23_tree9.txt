Thought: Generate Enhanced Alpha Factors Using Price, Volume, and Amount Data
- Thought: Calculate Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between the current close and the SMA as a momentum indicator
  - Sub-Thought: Develop a momentum indicator by comparing the current close to the EMA of the closing price
- Thought: Develop Reversal Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in close price from the previous day
  - Sub-Thought: Create a reversal signal by identifying days where the close is below the low of the last N days
- Thought: Explore Volume-Based Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Sum the volume over the last M days to identify accumulation or distribution phases
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate on-balance volume (OBV) using the daily close and volume, starting from an arbitrary initial value
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of the current volume to the average volume over the last R days
- Thought: Create Range-Based Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Determine the true range (maximum of high-low, high-close(previous), low-close(previous))
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over P days
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the relative range (ATR / (high - low)) to normalize the ATR
- Thought: Utilize Open, High, Low, Close Combinations
  - Sub-Thought: Implement a custom indicator that calculates the ratio of (close - open) / (high - low) to gauge intraday performance
  - Sub-Thought: Create an indicator that measures the frequency of days where close is above both open and close of the previous day
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of (close - open) / (high - low) over the last T days to assess trend strength
- Thought: Leverage Amount Data for Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the total amount traded over Q days to identify significant trading activity
  - Sub-Thought: Develop a ratio of the amount traded to the volume traded, which can be used to assess the average trade size
  - Sub-Thought: Create an indicator that calculates the ratio of the current amount traded to the average amount traded over the last S days
