```python
import pandas as pd

def heuristics_v2(df):
    """
    This function computes a novel alpha factor based on the given DataFrame.
    
    The alpha factor is computed as follows:
    1. Calculate the difference between high and low price (True Range).
    2. Calculate the percentage change in close price from the previous day.
    3. Calculate the volume weighted average price (VWAP) for the day.
    4. Combine these three measures into a single factor, where the factor value is
       the product of the true range, the percentage change in close price, and the VWAP.
       
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame with (open, high, low, close, amount, volume) columns.
    
    Returns:
    pd.Series: A Series indexed by (date) representing the factor values.
