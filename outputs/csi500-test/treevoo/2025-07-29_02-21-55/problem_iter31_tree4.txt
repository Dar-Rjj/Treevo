Thought: Analyze price and volume to predict future stock returns
- Subthought: Calculate the difference between today's closing price and yesterday's closing price
  - SubSubthought: If the difference is positive, label as Bullish; if negative, label as Bearish
    - SubSubSubthought: For bullish signals, calculate the ratio of close to open. Use this as a factor for predicting future returns, higher ratios indicating stronger bullishness
    - SubSubSubthought: For bearish signals, calculate the ratio of open to close. Use this as a factor for predicting future returns, lower ratios indicating stronger bearishness
- Subthought: Calculate the distance between today's high and low prices
  - SubSubthought: If the distance (high - low) is greater than a certain threshold, consider it a day of high volatility
    - SubSubSubthought: For high volatility days, calculate the percentage change from the opening price to the closing price. A significant positive or negative value could indicate a strong trend
  - SubSubthought: If the distance (high - low) is less than a certain threshold, consider it a day of low volatility
    - SubSubSubthought: For low volatility days, look at the position of the closing price relative to the day's high and low. If closer to the high, it may signal underlying strength; if closer to the low, it may show weakness
- Subthought: Look at the volume traded
  - SubSubthought: If volume is significantly higher than the recent average, it indicates a strong market sentiment
    - SubSubSubthought: When there's a large volume with an increase in the closing price, it suggests strong buying pressure and could be a positive indicator
    - SubSubSubthought: Conversely, a large volume with a decrease in the closing price may indicate strong selling pressure and could be seen as a negative sign
- Subthought: Consider the amount traded, not just volume, to incorporate the impact of price on total trading activity
  - SubSubthought: Compare today’s amount traded to the past several days' average. An above-average amount with rising prices might suggest a robust upturn
    - SubSubSubthought: Analyze the change in the amount traded from one day to the next. Sudden increases, especially coupled with upward price movements, could forecast further gains
  - SubSubthought: For decreases, check if the price is also falling. This combination might indicate that the security is becoming less attractive, potentially signaling a downturn
