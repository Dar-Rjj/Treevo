Thought: Calculate the difference between today's closing price and yesterday's closing price.
- Subthought: If the difference is positive, label as Bullish; if negative, label as Bearish.
  - SubSubthought: For bullish signals, calculate the ratio of close to open. Use this as a factor for predicting future returns, higher ratios indicating stronger bullishness.
  - SubSubthought: For bearish signals, calculate the ratio of open to close. Use this as a factor for predicting future returns, lower ratios indicating stronger bearishness.

Thought: Calculate the distance between today's high and low prices.
- Subthought: If the distance (high - low) is greater than a certain threshold, consider it a day of high volatility.
  - SubSubthought: For high volatility days, calculate the percentage change from the opening price to the closing price. A significant positive or negative value could indicate a strong trend.
  - SubSubthought: For low volatility days, look at the position of the closing price relative to the day's high and low. If closer to the high, it may signal underlying strength; if closer to the low, it may show weakness.

Thought: Look at the volume traded.
- Subthought: If volume is significantly higher than the recent average, it indicates a strong market sentiment.
  - SubSubthought: When there's a large volume with an increase in the closing price, it suggests strong buying pressure and could be a positive indicator.
  - SubSubthought: Conversely, a large volume with a decrease in the closing price may indicate strong selling pressure and could be seen as a negative sign.

Thought: Consider the amount traded, not just volume, to incorporate the impact of price on total trading activity.
- Subthought: Compare today’s amount traded to the past several days' average. An above-average amount with rising prices might suggest a robust upturn.
  - SubSubthought: Analyze the change in the amount traded from one day to the next. Sudden increases, especially coupled with upward price movements, could forecast further gains.
  - SubSubthought: For decreases, check if the price is also falling. This combination might indicate that the security is becoming less attractive, potentially signaling a downturn.
