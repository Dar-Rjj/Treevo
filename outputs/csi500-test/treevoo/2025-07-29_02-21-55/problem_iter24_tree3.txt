Alpha Mining for Predictive Factors
- Price-based Alpha Factors
  - Momentum Indicators
    - Daily Close to Open Return: (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t
    - 5-Day Momentum: Close_t / Close_{t-5} - 1
  - Volatility Indicators
    - True Range: Max(High_t - Low_t, Abs(High_t - Close_{t-1}), Abs(Low_t - Close_{t-1}))
    - Average True Range over 5 days
- Volume-based Alpha Factors
  - Volume Change
    - Daily Volume Growth: (Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}) / Volume_{t-1}
  - Money Flow Index
    - Typical Price: (High_t + Low_t + Close_t) / 3
    - Raw Money Flow: TypicalPrice * Volume
    - Positive Money Flow: Sum(RawMoneyFlow on Up Days)
    - Negative Money Flow: Sum(RawMoneyFlow on Down Days)
- Combined Price and Volume Alpha Factors
  - Chaikin Oscillator
    - Accumulation/Distribution Line: ((Close_t - Low_t) - (High_t - Close_t)) / (High_t - Low_t) * Volume_t
    - 3-Day EMA of AD Line
    - 10-Day EMA of AD Line
    - Chaikin Oscillator: 3-Day EMA of AD Line - 10-Day EMA of AD Line
- High and Low Difference Factors
  - Percentage Price Oscillator
    - %K: 100 * ((Close_t - LowestLow_14) / (HighestHigh_14 - LowestLow_14))
    - %D: 3-Day SMA of %K
- Gap Analysis Factors
  - Opening Gap Strength
    - Gap Size: |Open_t - Close_{t-1}|
    - Normalized Gap: GapSize / (High_{t-1} - Low_{t-1})
  - Closing Gap Analysis
    - Close above high of previous day: if (Close_t > High_{t-1}) then 1 else 0
- Pattern Recognition
  - Breakout Patterns
    - Previous Resistance as Support: if (Low_t > High_{t-n}) for a series of n past days
  - Reversal Patterns
    - Hammer/Candle Formations: Identify hammer shapes based on body and shadow ratios
- Custom Interactions
  - Relative Close to Volume Ratio: (Close_t / Close_{t-1}) * (Volume_t / Volume_{t-1})
  - Moving Average Crossovers Interaction
    - Short-term vs. Long-term: 5-Day MA cross over 20-Day MA interaction with Volume trend
