Thought: Develop a comprehensive alpha factor by integrating momentum, volatility, and volume-based signals.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing price over the past 50 days.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Use the SMA as a signal to buy (when close > SMA) or sell (when close < SMA).
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) of the closing price over the past 20 days.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Combine the EMA with the SMA to create a dual-moving-average crossover strategy for signaling buy/sell.
    Sub-Thought: Compute the daily range by subtracting the low from the high.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Sum the daily ranges over the past 30 days to get a rolling volatility measure.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: If the distance (high - low) is greater than a certain threshold, consider it a day of high volatility.
                Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: For high volatility days, calculate the percentage change from the opening price to the closing price. A significant positive or negative value could indicate a strong trend.
                Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: For low volatility days, look at the position of the closing price relative to the day's high and low. If closer to the high, it may signal underlying strength; if closer to the low, it may show weakness.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over the past 14 days.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Use the ATR as an indicator to enter or exit trades, with higher ATR suggesting increased market volatility and potential for larger price movements.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) by summing the volume on up days and subtracting volume on down days.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Analyze OBV trends to identify potential buying or selling pressure.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Use the OBV in conjunction with price changes to confirm the direction of the trend.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Look at the volume traded.
                Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: If volume is significantly higher than the recent average, it indicates a strong market sentiment.
                    Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: When there's a large volume with an increase in the closing price, it suggests strong buying pressure and could be a positive indicator.
                    Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Conversely, a large volume with a decrease in the closing price may indicate strong selling pressure and could be seen as a negative sign.
    Sub-Thought: Consider the amount traded, not just volume, to incorporate the impact of price on total trading activity.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Compare today’s amount traded to the past several days' average. An above-average amount with rising prices might suggest a robust upturn.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Analyze the change in the amount traded from one day to the next. Sudden increases, especially coupled with upward price movements, could forecast further gains.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: For decreases, check if the price is also falling. This combination might indicate that the security is becoming less attractive, potentially signaling a downturn.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today's closing price and yesterday's closing price.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: If the difference is positive, label as Bullish; if negative, label as Bearish.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: For bullish signals, calculate the ratio of close to open. Use this as a factor for predicting future returns, higher ratios indicating stronger bullishness.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: For bearish signals, calculate the ratio of open to close. Use this as a factor for predicting future returns, lower ratios indicating stronger bearishness.
    Sub-Thought: Explore a combination of price and volume to create a hybrid alpha factor.
        Sub-Sub-Thought: Compute the money flow index (MFI) by dividing the total positive money flow by the total negative money flow.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Use the MFI to identify overbought (MFI > 80) or oversold (MFI < 20) conditions.
            Sub-Sub-Sub-Thought: Integrate the MFI with other factors like SMA and EMA to refine trading signals.
