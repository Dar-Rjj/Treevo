Thought: Calculate the difference between the close price and open price to assess daily market sentiment.
  Sub-thought: Compute the rolling sum of the daily price differences over a 5-day window to gauge short-term momentum.
    Sub-thought: Apply a simple moving average (SMA) with a 10-day period to the 5-day rolling sum to smooth out noise.
      Sub-thought: Compute the difference between the current value and the SMA of the 5-day rolling sum to determine the strength of the recent trend.
        Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of the volume to the absolute value of the close-open difference to identify potential volatility.
          Sub-thought: Compute the rolling mean of this ratio over a 20-day period to stabilize the measure.
            Sub-thought: Determine the difference between the current ratio and its 20-day rolling mean to highlight unusual trading activity.
              Sub-thought: Use the high and low prices to calculate the true range, capturing the full range of price movement.
                Sub-thought: Compute the rolling mean of the true range over a 30-day period to represent the average volatility.
                  Sub-thought: Subtract the 30-day rolling mean of the true range from the true range to identify days with abnormally high or low volatility.
                    Sub-thought: Multiply the result by the sign of the difference between the close and open prices to incorporate the direction of the price movement into the final alpha factor.
