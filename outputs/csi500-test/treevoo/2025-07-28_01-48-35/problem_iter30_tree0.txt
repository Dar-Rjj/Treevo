Thought: Create simple alpha factors using OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data to predict future stock returns.
    Sub-Thought 1: Calculate momentum-based indicators
        Sub-Thought 1.1: Use the change in close price over a fixed period as a basic momentum indicator.
            - Implementation: `alpha_factor = close_price[t] - close_price[t - n]`
        Sub-Thought 1.2: Compute the average of closing prices over a certain period and use it as an indication of medium-term trend.
            - Implementation: `avg_close = sum(close_prices[t-n:t]) / n; alpha_factor = close_price[t] - avg_close`
    Sub-Thought 2: Explore mean reversion strategies
        Sub-Thought 2.1: Identify if the stock is overbought or oversold by comparing the current close price with recent highs and lows.
            - Implementation: `high_low_range = high_price[t] - low_price[t]; alpha_factor = (close_price[t] - low_price[t]) / high_low_range - 0.5`
        Sub-Thought 2.2: Calculate the difference between the current close and the average of the last few closes, indicating potential reversion.
            - Implementation: `recent_avg = sum(close_prices[t-3:t]) / 3; alpha_factor = (close_price[t] - recent_avg) / recent_avg`
    Sub-Thought 3: Analyze volatility
        Sub-Thought 3.1: Estimate the volatility of the stock using the standard deviation of daily returns over a specific lookback period.
            - Implementation: `daily_returns = [close_price[i] - close_price[i-1] for i in range(t-n, t)]; std_dev = sqrt(sum((x - mean(daily_returns))**2 for x in daily_returns) / n); alpha_factor = std_dev`
        Sub-Thought 3.2: Calculate the ATR (Average True Range) to gauge the market's volatility.
            - Implementation: `true_ranges = [max(high_price[i] - low_price[i], abs(high_price[i] - close_price[i-1]), abs(low_price[i] - close_price[i-1])) for i in range(t-n, t)]; atr = sum(true_ranges) / n; alpha_factor = atr`
    Sub-Thought 4: Incorporate volume into alpha factor design
        Sub-Thought 4.1: Investigate the relationship between price changes and volume, suggesting increased interest in the stock.
            - Implementation: `volume_change = (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) / volume[t-1]; price_change = (close_price[t] - close_price[t-1]) / close_price[t-1]; alpha_factor = volume_change * price_change`
        Sub-Thought 4.2: Assess whether there is a significant increase in volume compared to the average volume over a specified period, potentially indicating a breakout.
            - Implementation: `avg_volume = sum(volume[t-n:t]) / n; volume_spike = (volume[t] > 2 * avg_volume); alpha_factor = volume_spike * (close_price[t] - close_price[t-1])
