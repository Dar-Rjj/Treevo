    price_change = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate the amount to volume ratio
    amount_volume_ratio = df['amount'] / df['volume']

    # The factor is designed to capture the volatility (price_range) and the trend (price_change),
    # while also considering the liquidity (amount_volume_ratio)
    factor = (price_range * price_change) / amount_volume_ratio
