Thought: Calculate the momentum factor using the closing prices
    Sub-thought: Compute the return over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
        Sub-thought: Use the formula (Close_t / Close_{t-5}) - 1
    Sub-thought: Compute the return over a long period (e.g., 20 days)
        Sub-thought: Use the formula (Close_t / Close_{t-20}) - 1
    Sub-thought: Determine the momentum factor by subtracting the short-term return from the long-term return
        Sub-thought: Use the formula (Long-term return) - (Short-term return)
Thought: Analyze the relationship between trading volume and stock returns
    Sub-thought: Compute the average trading volume over a certain period (e.g., 30 days)
        Sub-thought: Sum the trading volume for the past 30 days and divide by 30
    Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in trading volume compared to the average
        Sub-thought: Use the formula (Volume_t / Average Volume) - 1
    Sub-thought: Examine the correlation between the percentage change in volume and the daily return
        Sub-thought: Use the formula Correlation(Percentage Change in Volume, Daily Return)
Thought: Explore the volatility of the stock using the high and low prices
    Sub-thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over a certain period (e.g., 14 days)
        Sub-thought: For each day, compute the true range as the maximum of (High - Low), (High - Previous Close), and (Previous Close - Low)
        Sub-thought: Sum the true ranges for the past 14 days and divide by 14
    Sub-thought: Analyze the impact of ATR on the stock's future returns
        Sub-thought: Categorize the ATR into quartiles and calculate the average return for each quartile
