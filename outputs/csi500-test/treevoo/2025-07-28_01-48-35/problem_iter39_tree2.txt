Alpha Mining for Predictive Factors
- Momentum Factors
  - Price Change Over a Short Period (1 day)
    - Factor: close(t) - close(t-1)
  - Price Change Over a Medium Period (10 days)
    - Factor: close(t) - close(t-10)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI) Over a Period
    - Sub-factor: Calculate the average gain and loss over a 14-day period, then compute the RSI value without normalizing
- Volume-Based Factors
  - Volume Trend Over a Short Period (3 days)
    - Factor: volume(t)/volume(t-3)
  - Volume Trend Over a Medium Period (20 days)
    - Factor: (volume(t)-volume(t-20))/volume(t-20)
- Volatility Factors
  - Historical Volatility (Standard Deviation of Returns)
    - Sub-factor: Standard deviation of daily returns over the past 30 days
  - Average True Range (ATR) Over a Period
    - Sub-factor: Calculate ATR over 14 days using high, low, and close prices, without normalization
- Moving Averages
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover
    - Sub-factor: SMA(50) - SMA(200)
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Difference
    - Sub-factor: EMA(12) - EMA(26)
- Accumulation/Distribution Line
  - Factor: Cumulative flow based on (close - open) / (high - low) * volume, without any normalization
- On-Balance Volume (OBV)
  - Factor: OBV is the running total of a security's trading volume and shows whether this volume is flowing into or out of a given security
- High-Low Ratio
  - Factor: (High(t) - Low(t)) / (High(t-1) - Low(t-1))
- Open-Close Spread
  - Factor: Open(t) - Close(t-1)
- Gap-Up/Gap-Down Indicator
  - Factor: (Open(t) > Close(t-1)) - (Open(t) < Close(t-1))
- Price and Volume Correlation
  - Factor: Pearson correlation coefficient between price changes and volume changes over the last 30 days
- Money Flow Index (MFI)
  - Factor: Calculate MFI over 14 days using typical price and volume, without normalization
- Chande Momentum Oscillator
  - Factor: (Sum of Positive Changes over 10 days - Sum of Negative Changes over 10 days) / (Sum of Positive Changes over 10 days + Sum of Negative Changes over 10 days)
- Elder Ray Bull/Bear Power
  - Factor: Bull Power = High - EMA(13), Bear Power = Low - EMA(13)
- Stochastic Oscillator
  - Factor: %K = 100 * (Close - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) over 14 days, without normalization
- Williams %R
  - Factor: (Highest High - Close) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) over 14 days, without normalization
- Chaikin Oscillator
  - Factor: 3-day EMA of Accumulation/Distribution Line minus 10-day EMA of Accumulation/Distribution Line
- Bollinger Bands
  - Sub-factor: (Close - SMA(20)) / (Standard Deviation of Close over 20 days * 2)

  - Factor: MACD Line - Signal Line
- Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA)
  - Factor: KAMA(10) - KAMA(20)
- Parabolic SAR
  - Factor: If Close is above Parabolic SAR, assign 1, else assign -1
- Coppock Curve
  - Factor: 14-period weighted moving average of 11-month rate of change plus 14-month rate of change
- Fisher Transform
  - Factor: Apply Fisher Transform to price over a 9-day period, without normalization
- Vortex Indicator
  - Factor: VI+ - VI- over 14 days
- Volume Rate of Change (VROC)
