Thought: Calculate simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices to identify trend
    Thought: Use 5-day SMA as a short-term trend indicator
        Thought: Compute the 5-day SMA at day t using close prices from days t-4 to t
    Thought: Use 20-day SMA as an intermediate-term trend indicator
        Thought: Compute the 20-day SMA at day t using close prices from days t-19 to t
    Thought: Compare 5-day and 20-day SMAs to find potential buy/sell signals
        Thought: If 5-day SMA > 20-day SMA, suggest bullish signal
        Thought: If 5-day SMA < 20-day SMA, suggest bearish signal
Thought: Calculate the difference between high and low prices to assess volatility
    Thought: Average the daily differences over a 10-day period to get a smoothed volatility measure
        Thought: Compute the 10-day average of (high - low) at day t
    Thought: Use the smoothed volatility to adjust the weight of the SMA signal
        Thought: If volatility is high, reduce the confidence in the SMA crossover signal
        Thought: If volatility is low, increase the confidence in the SMA crossover signal
Thought: Analyze the relationship between volume and price changes
    Thought: Compute the ratio of volume to price change over a 5-day window
        Thought: Calculate the 5-day cumulative volume and the 5-day cumulative price change
        Thought: Divide the 5-day cumulative volume by the 5-day cumulative price change to get the volume-to-price-change ratio
    Thought: Use the volume-to-price-change ratio to confirm the direction of the trend
        Thought: If the ratio is increasing, support the current trend (upward or downward)
        Thought: If the ratio is decreasing, question the sustainability of the current trend
Thought: Incorporate the opening and closing prices to identify patterns
    Thought: Calculate the body of the candlestick (open - close)
        Thought: Sum the body values over a 10-day period to gauge market sentiment
            Thought: Positive sum indicates buying pressure
            Thought: Negative sum indicates selling pressure
    Thought: Use the 10-day sum of candlestick bodies to enhance the SMA and volume signals
        Thought: If the sum is positive and SMA signals are bullish, strongly suggest a buy
        Thought: If the sum is negative and SMA signals are bearish, strongly suggest a sell
