Generate alpha factors using price and volume data
- Day's momentum: Calculate the difference between close and open prices
- Relative closing position: Compute the ratio of (high - close) to (high - low)
- Volume-weighted price: Calculate the weighted average price using volume as weights for (open, high, low, close) prices
- Multi-day price change: Calculate the percentage change in close prices over various intervals
- Volume trend: Evaluate the change in trading volume over time to identify unusual activity
- High-low spread: Calculate the difference between the highest and lowest prices over a specified period
- Price volatility: Compute the standard deviation of daily returns over a moving window
- Accumulation/Distribution Line: Develop a factor by accumulating the volume-adjusted close location value over time
- Money flow index: Integrate a factor that tracks the flow of money into and out of a stock over a set period
- RSI-like factor: Formulate a similar RSI-like factor focusing purely on the price movement magnitude
- Moving averages: Implement simple and exponential moving averages for different look-back periods
- Crossover signals: Generate signals based on the crossover of short-term and long-term moving averages
- Daily return: Calculate the daily return as (close - open) / open
- Volume return: Calculate the ratio of today’s volume to the average volume over a specific past period
- Open-close reversal: Analyze the pattern where the next day's open is significantly different from the previous day's close
- Close-to-open gap: Measure the gap between the current day's close and the next day's open
- Average true range (ATR): Calculate ATR using the true range values over a certain period
- Trend strength: Develop a trend strength indicator by calculating the slope of a linear regression line fit to the close prices over a defined period
