Thought: Measure Volatility and Risk
- Subthought: Calculate True Range (TR)
  - Subthought: TR as the maximum of (High - Low), (High - Previous Close), (Low - Previous Close)
- Subthought: Compute Average True Range (ATR) over 14 days
- Subthought: Use ATR to Gauge Volatility
  - Subthought: High ATR indicating high volatility

Thought: Assess Volume and Amount Fluctuations
- Subthought: Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
  - Subthought: OBV increases when volume on an up day exceeds volume on a down day
  - Subthought: OBV decreases when volume on a down day exceeds volume on an up day
- Subthought: Calculate Money Flow Index (MFI) over 14 days
  - Subthought: MFI above 80 indicating overbought conditions
  - Subthought: MFI below 20 indicating oversold conditions
- Subthought: Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
  - Subthought: VWAP as cumulative (Volume * Typical Price) / cumulative Volume
  - Subthought: Compare VWAP with current Close price
    - Subthought: Close price above VWAP indicating buying pressure
    - Subthought: Close price below VWAP indicating selling pressure
