Alpha Mining for Predictive Factors
- Price Momentum Factors
  - Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices.
    - Calculate the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices.
    - Generate a signal where the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA.
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Calculate the RSI over a 14-day period using closing prices.
    - Generate a signal when the RSI is below 30 (oversold) or above 70 (overbought).
- Volume-Based Factors
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Calculate the cumulative sum of volume on up days and subtract the volume on down days.
    - Generate a signal when OBV shows a significant increase or decrease.
  - Volume Price Trend (VPT)
    - Calculate the VPT by multiplying the difference between the current close and previous close by the volume, and then summing this value over a period.
    - Generate a signal when VPT shows a significant increase or decrease.
- High-Low Range Factors
  - Average True Range (ATR)
    - Calculate the ATR over a 14-day period using high, low, and close prices.
    - Generate a signal when the ATR is above a certain threshold, indicating high volatility.
  - High-Low Ratio
    - Calculate the ratio of the current day's high to the previous day's low.
    - Generate a signal when the ratio is above a certain threshold, indicating potential breakout.
- Gap Factors
  - Opening Gap
    - Calculate the difference between the current day's open and the previous day's close.
    - Generate a signal when there is a significant gap, either positive or negative.
  - Intraday Gap
    - Calculate the difference between the current day's high and the previous day's low.
    - Generate a signal when there is a significant intraday gap.
- Amount and Volume Correlation
  - Correlation between Amount and Volume
    - Calculate the correlation between the amount and volume over a 20-day period.
    - Generate a signal when the correlation is above a certain threshold, indicating strong relationships.
- Combined Factors
  - Composite Signal
    - Combine multiple signals from different factors (e.g., SMA crossover, RSI, OBV, VPT, ATR, High-Low Ratio, Opening Gap, Intraday Gap, and Correlation between Amount and Volume).
    - Use a weighted sum or logical combination to generate a final composite signal.
