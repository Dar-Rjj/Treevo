- Synthesize Price and Volume Dynamics with Momentum and Trend Indicators
  - Evaluate Intraday Price Movements and Ranges
    - Calculate Intraday Range
      - Use High and Low prices
    - Calculate Close-to-Range Ratio
      - Use Close price and Intraday Range
    - Calculate Intraday Return
      - Subtract Open price from Close price
    - Calculate True Range
      - max(high[t] - low[t], abs(high[t] - close[t-1]), abs(low[t] - close[t-1]))
  - Assess Short-Term, Medium-Term, and Long-Term Momentum
    - Short-term: (close[t] - close[t-7]) / close[t-7]
    - Medium-term: (close[t] - close[t-21]) / close[t-21]
    - Long-term: (close[t] - close[t-63]) / close[t-63]
  - Measure Volatility and Relative Strength
    - Average True Range (ATR): SMA(true range, 14)
    - Relative Strength (RS): close[t] / close[t-21]
  - Money Flow Analysis
    - Money Flow Multiplier: (close - (high + low) / 2) / (high - low)
    - Money Flow Volume: Money Flow Multiplier * volume
    - Money Flow Index (MFI): sum(Money Flow Volume for 14 days) / sum(volume for 14 days)
  - Directional Movement and Trend Indicators
    - Positive Directional Movement (+DM): high[t] - high[t-1] if high[t] > high[t-1] and high[t] - high[t-1] > low[t-1] - low[t] else 0
    - Negative Directional Movement (-DM): low[t-1] - low[t] if low[t-1] > low[t] and low[t-1] - low[t] > high[t] - high[t-1] else 0
    - Directional Indicator (DI): SMA(+DM or -DM, 14) / ATR
  - Integrate Opening Impact and Volume Adjustments
    - Opening Impact Factor
      - Subtract Today's Open-to-Close Return
    - Volume Adjusted Spread
      - Multiply Intraday Spread by Volume
    - Volume Trend Score
      - Compute Average Volume (Last 10 Days)
        - Take Mean
      - Compute Volume Change Rate
        - Divide by Average Volume
      - Summarize Volume Trend
        - Add Weight to Positive Changes
          - Apply if Volume Change Rate > 1
          - Multiply by a Fixed Coefficient (e.g., 1.5)
        - Add Weight to Negative Changes
          - Apply if Volume Change Rate < 1
          - Multiply by a Fixed Coefficient (e.g., -1.2)
  - Composite Alpha Factor
    - Combine Momentum, RS, MFI, DI
      - (short-term momentum + medium-term momentum + long-term momentum + RS + MFI + DI) / 6
    - Integrate Volume Trends
      - Adjust for Volume Activity
        - Calculate Average Volume over 20 days ending at t-1
          - Use Volume from t-20 to t-1
          - Sum and then divide by 20
        - Calculate Short-Term Volume Change
          - Use Volume of t and t-5
          - Subtract to get 5-day Volume Change
        - Volume Trend Indicator
          - If 5-day Volume Change > 0
            - Assign +1
          - Else
            - Assign -1
  - Final Alpha Factor
    - Combine Composite Alpha Factor and Volume Trend
      - Composite alpha factor * Volume Ratio
    - Adjust for Opening Impact
      - Multiply by Opening Impact Factor
    - Final Adjustment
      - Use Combined Momentum and Close-to-Range Ratio
      - Multiply by Volume Trend Score
      - Divide by Average Volume over 20 days
      - Multiply by Combined Volume and Price Momentum
        - Use Volume Trend Score
        - Use Relative High-Low Spread
