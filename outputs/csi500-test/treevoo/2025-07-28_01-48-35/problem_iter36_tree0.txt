Thought: Explore price and volume patterns for generating alpha factors
    Sub-Thought: Analyze intra-day price movements
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of close to open prices as a measure of daily momentum
            Sub-Thought: Incorporate the high-low range to capture volatility
                Sub-Thought: Develop a composite factor using (close - open) / (high - low)
    Sub-Thought: Examine historical price patterns
        Sub-Thought: Consider the relationship between current and past prices
            Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between the current day's close and the previous day's close
                Sub-Thought: Extend this to a 5-day lookback period to smooth out short-term fluctuations
                    Sub-Thought: Compute the average 5-day return to identify consistent trends
    Sub-Thought: Investigate trading volume and its impact on price
        Sub-Thought: Analyze the relationship between volume and price changes
            Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference in volume from one day to the next
                Sub-Thought: Combine volume change with price change to create a volume-weighted momentum factor
                    Sub-Thought: Use (close - open) * (volume_change / volume) to emphasize significant price moves
    Sub-Thought: Utilize amount data for additional insights
        Sub-Thought: Analyze the relationship between trade amount and price
            Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of amount to volume to infer average trade size
                Sub-Thought: Combine this with price change to create an amount-weighted momentum factor
                    Sub-Thought: Use (close - open) * (amount / volume) to highlight large trades' impact
    Sub-Thought: Combine multiple factors for a comprehensive alpha signal
        Sub-Thought: Integrate the price, volume, and amount factors
            Sub-Thought: Sum the individual factors to create a composite score
                Sub-Thought: Adjust the weights of each factor based on their predictive power
                    Sub-Thought: Continuously evaluate and refine the weights to optimize the alpha signal
