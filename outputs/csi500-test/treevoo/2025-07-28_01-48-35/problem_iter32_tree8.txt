Crossover Synthesis of Momentum, Volume-Weighted Price Movement, and High-Low Spread Factors with Daily Market Sentiment and Volatility
├── Calculate Intraday Range
│   ├── Use High and Low prices (High - Low)
├── Calculate Close-to-Range Ratio
│   ├── Use Close price and Intraday Range (Close / Intraday Range)
├── Calculate Momentum Component
│   ├── Sum Returns of Close prices (last N days)
│   └── Multiply by Close-to-Range Ratio
├── Adjust for Volume Activity
│   ├── Compute 5-day Volume Change
│   │   ├── Subtract Volume(t-5) from Volume(t)
│   ├── Compute Average Volume (Last 10 Days)
│   │   ├── Take Mean
│   ├── Compute Volume Change Rate
│   │   ├── Divide Volume Change by Average Volume
│   └── Apply Fixed Coefficient to Volume Trend
│       ├── 1.5 if Volume Change Rate > 1, -1.2 if < 1
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Intraday Return
│   ├── Subtract Open from Close (Close - Open)
│   └── Multiply Intraday Return by Volume
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Scale Volume by Last 15 Days' Average
│   │   ├── Divide Today's Volume by Average of Last 15 Days' Volume
│   └── Multiply High-Low Spread by Scaled Volume
├── Calculate Daily Market Sentiment
│   ├── Compute the difference between Close and Open (Close - Open)
│   └── Compute the rolling sum of the daily price differences over a 5-day window
│       ├── Smooth out noise using a 10-day simple moving average (SMA)
│       └── Compute the difference between the current value and the SMA of the 5-day rolling sum
├── Calculate Volatility Ratio
│   ├── Compute the ratio of the volume to the absolute value of the close-open difference
│   └── Compute the rolling mean of this ratio over a 20-day period
│       └── Determine the difference between the current ratio and its 20-day rolling mean
├── Calculate True Range
│   ├── Use the high and low prices to calculate the true range
│   └── Compute the rolling mean of the true range over a 30-day period
│       └── Subtract the 30-day rolling mean of the true range from the true range
│           └── Multiply the result by the sign of the difference between the close and open prices
├── Final Combined Factor
│   ├── Multiply Momentum Component by Volume Trend Score
│   ├── Add Volume-Weighted Intraday Return
│   ├── Add Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Add the Difference in 5-Day Rolling Sum and its SMA
│   └── Add the Difference in Volatility Ratio and its 20-Day Rolling Mean
└── Opening Impact Adjustment
    ├── Subtract Today's Open-to-Close Return
    └── Output as Final Alpha Factor
