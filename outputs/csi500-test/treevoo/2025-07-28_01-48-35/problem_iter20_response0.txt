```python
def heuristics_v2(df):
    # Calculate the relative difference between the close price and the open price
    close_open_diff = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate the mid-point of high and low for a period
    mid_point = (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2
    
    # Calculate the volume-weighted amount
    vol_weighted_amount = df['amount'] / df['volume']
    
    # Combine the three calculated series into a single alpha factor
    # The alpha factor considers how the day's close deviated from its open, 
    # where the prices were on average during the day (mid point), and the average transaction size.
    alpha_factor = (close_open_diff / mid_point) * vol_weighted_amount
    
    return alpha_factor
