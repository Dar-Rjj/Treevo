- Analyze price patterns and relationships
  - Calculate daily return
    - (close - open) / open
  - Calculate momentum indicators
    - Short-term: (close[t] - close[t-7]) / close[t-7]
    - Medium-term: (close[t] - close[t-21]) / close[t-21]
    - Long-term: (close[t] - close[t-63]) / close[t-63]
  - Evaluate volatility
    - True range: max(high[t] - low[t], abs(high[t] - close[t-1]), abs(low[t] - close[t-1]))
    - Average true range (ATR): SMA(true range, 14)
  - Assess relative strength
    - Relative Strength (RS): close[t] / close[t-21]
  - Measure money flow
    - Money Flow Multiplier: (close - (high + low) / 2) / (high - low)
    - Money Flow Volume: Money Flow Multiplier * volume
    - Money Flow Index (MFI): sum(Money Flow Volume for 14 days) / sum(volume for 14 days)
  - Determine trend direction
    - Directional Movement: 
      - Positive Directional Movement (+DM): high[t] - high[t-1] if high[t] > high[t-1] and high[t] - high[t-1] > low[t-1] - low[t] else 0
      - Negative Directional Movement (-DM): low[t-1] - low[t] if low[t-1] > low[t] and low[t-1] - low[t] > high[t] - high[t-1] else 0
    - Directional Indicator (DI): SMA(+DM or -DM, 14) / ATR
  - Combine indicators
    - Composite alpha factor: (momentum[short-term] + momentum[medium-term] + momentum[long-term] + RS + MFI + DI) / 6
- Evaluate trading volume
  - Calculate volume ratio
    - Volume Ratio: volume[t] / SMA(volume, 21)
- Integrate price and volume analysis
  - Integrated alpha factor
    - Composite alpha factor * Volume Ratio
- Generate final alpha factor
  - Final Alpha Factor: Integrated alpha factor
