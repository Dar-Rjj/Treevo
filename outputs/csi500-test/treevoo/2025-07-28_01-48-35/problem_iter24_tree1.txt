Generate alpha factors using price and volume data
- Calculate the difference between close and open prices (Day's Range)
-- Use this as a simple momentum indicator
- Create a factor based on the relationship between high, low, and close prices
-- Compute the ratio of (high - close) to (high - low) indicating the relative position of the closing price within the day's range
- Volume-weighted price calculations
-- Calculate the weighted average price using volume as weights for (open, high, low, close) prices
- Price change over multi-day periods
-- Calculate the percentage change in close prices over various intervals (e.g., 5-day, 10-day, 20-day)
- Volume trend analysis
-- Evaluate the change in trading volume over time to identify unusual activity
- High-low price spread
-- Calculate the difference between the highest and lowest prices over a specified period (e.g., 5-days, 10-days)
- Price volatility
-- Compute the standard deviation of daily returns over a moving window (e.g., 30 days)
- Accumulation/Distribution Line
-- Develop a factor by accumulating the volume-adjusted close location value over time
- Money flow index
-- Integrate a factor that tracks the flow of money into and out of a stock over a set period
- Relative strength index (RSI) without normalization
-- Formulate a similar RSI-like factor but without normalizing or scaling, focusing purely on the price movement magnitude
- Moving averages
-- Implement simple and exponential moving averages for different look-back periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days) to gauge trend direction
- Crossover signals
-- Generate signals based on the crossover of short-term and long-term moving averages
- Daily return
-- Calculate the daily return as (close - open) / open
- Volume return
-- Calculate the ratio of today’s volume to the average volume over a specific past period (e.g., last 20 days) to capture volume spikes
- Open-close reversal
-- Analyze the pattern where the next day's open is significantly different from the previous day's close
- Close-to-open gap
-- Measure the gap between the current day's close and the next day's open
- Average true range (ATR)
-- Calculate ATR using the true range values over a certain period, capturing the market's volatility
- Trend strength
-- Develop a trend strength indicator by calculating the slope of a linear regression line fit to the close prices over a defined period
