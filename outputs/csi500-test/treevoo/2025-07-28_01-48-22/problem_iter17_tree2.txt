Performing Alpha Mining for Novel and Interpretable Factors
- Technical Indicators Based on Price Data
  - Moving Averages Crossovers
    - Short-Term vs Long-Term MA Crossover: Difference between a 10-day simple moving average (SMA) and a 50-day SMA
    - Mid-Term vs Long-Term MA Crossover: Difference between a 30-day SMA and a 200-day SMA
  - Momentum Indicators
    - Rate of Change (ROC): Percentage change in close price over the past n days
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI) without normalization: Calculated as the average gain divided by the average loss over the past 14 days, but without further normalization
- Volume-Based Indicators
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV) Trend Indicator: OBV trend calculated as the cumulative sum adjusted by volume and price changes. The sign of the close-to-close price change dictates whether to add or subtract the volume.
  - Money Flow Index (MFI) without normalization: Ratio of positive and negative money flows over n periods, similar to RSI but using typical prices and volumes
- Combined Price and Volume Analysis
  - Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
  - Chaikin Oscillator: Subtraction of two exponential moving averages of the Accumulation/Distribution Line
- Patterns and Anomalies Detection
  - Breakout Above Previous High: Indicates if today’s high exceeds the highest high in a specific lookback window
  - Breakdown Below Previous Low: Indicates if today’s low falls below the lowest low in a specified lookback period
- Custom Composite Factors
  - Integration of Momentum with Volume Support: ROC multiplied by an adjusted OBV change factor, which could signal strength in both price and volume trends
  - Complex Conditionals Involving Multiple Signals: Boolean logic combining multiple signals, e.g., a buy signal when ROC is positive, MFI indicates no overbought condition, and there's a breakout above the previous high
