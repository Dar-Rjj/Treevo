Thought: Begin with enhanced technical indicators as potential alpha factors.
- Thought: Calculate the weighted moving average of closing prices over a certain period.
  - Sub-Thought: Use a 5-day window for calculating the weighted moving average, with more weight on recent prices.
  - Sub-Thought: Compare today's close price to the 5-day weighted moving average (WMA) to generate a signal.
    - Sub-Thought: If today's close is above the WMA, output a positive value indicating a buy signal; otherwise, output a negative value indicating a sell signal.
- Thought: Consider momentum by examining the rate of change in closing prices over a specified duration.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in the closing price from 10 days ago to today.
  - Sub-Thought: Enhance the indicator by combining it with the percentage change from 20 days ago to today.
  - Sub-Thought: Use this combined percentage change as an indicator, with larger positive values suggesting stronger upward momentum and vice versa.
- Thought: Explore the relationship between opening and closing prices as a predictor of future performance.
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between the daily close and open prices.
  - Sub-Thought: Create a cumulative sum of these differences over the past 20 trading days to capture longer-term trends.
  - Sub-Thought: Introduce a smoothing factor to the cumulative sum to reduce noise and highlight significant trends.
- Thought: Utilize volume data to identify unusual trading activity that may signal upcoming price movements.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 20-day average trading volume.
  - Sub-Thought: On any given day, if the volume is significantly (e.g., 3 standard deviations) above this average, flag it as potentially significant.
  - Sub-Thought: Combine this volume anomaly with the sign of the day's return (positive or negative) and the direction of the 5-day WMA to generate a more nuanced signal about the direction of the expected price movement.
- Thought: Investigate the volatility of the stock using the high and low prices.
  - Sub-Thought: For each day, calculate the range (high minus low).
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the 10-day moving average of these ranges.
  - Sub-Thought: Divide the current day's range by its 10-day moving average.
  - Sub-Thought: Interpret this relative range as a measure of relative volatility, with higher values suggesting periods of increased uncertainty or opportunity.
  - Sub-Thought: Incorporate the 5-day WMA into the relative range calculation to adjust for price level changes.
