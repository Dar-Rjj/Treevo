Volume and Price Momentum Hybrid Factor
├── Calculate Volume Difference
│   ├── Use Volume from day t
│   └── Subtract Volume from day t-1
├── Calculate Average High-Low Range
│   ├── Collect High and Low prices for past 5 days (t-4 to t)
│   └── Compute the average of (High - Low) for those 5 days
├── Calculate Close Price Change
│   ├── Use Close price from day t
│   └── Subtract Close price from day t-1
├── Integrate Factors
│   ├── Multiply Volume Difference by a constant (e.g., 0.5)
│   ├── Multiply Average High-Low Range by a constant (e.g., 0.3)
│   └── Add Close Price Change
└── Final Factor
    └── Sum the results from the previous steps
