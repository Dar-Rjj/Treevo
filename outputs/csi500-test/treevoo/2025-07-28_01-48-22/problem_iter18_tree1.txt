Thought: Constructing Alpha Factors from OHLCV Data
- Sub-thought: Trend Following Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover
    - Sub-thought: Calculate SMA for a short period (e.g., 5 days)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate SMA for a long period (e.g., 20 days)
    - Sub-thought: Determine the crossover signal by comparing the two SMAs
- Sub-thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Price Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ROC over a defined period (e.g., 14 days)
    - Sub-thought: Interpret the ROC value to infer momentum strength
- Sub-thought: Volume Indicators
  - Sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Sub-thought: Update OBV based on trading volume and price change
    - Sub-thought: Analyze OBV trends to predict future price movements
- Sub-thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Sub-thought: True Range (TR)
    - Sub-thought: Compute the TR as the greatest of the current high less the current low, the absolute value of the current high minus the previous close, and the absolute value of the current low minus the previous close
    - Sub-thought: Use TR to gauge market volatility and potential breakout opportunities
- Sub-thought: Relative Strength Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate RSI using the average gain and loss over a specific period (e.g., 14 days)
    - Sub-thought: Interpret RSI values to identify overbought or oversold conditions
- Sub-thought: Pattern Recognition
  - Sub-thought: Identify Candlestick Patterns
    - Sub-thought: Detect bullish and bearish candlestick formations such as Doji, Hammer, Shooting Star
    - Sub-thought: Incorporate identified patterns into predictive models
- Sub-thought: Combined Factor Models
  - Sub-thought: Ensemble of Multiple Indicators
    - Sub-thought: Integrate signals from trend, momentum, volume, and relative strength indicators
    - Sub-thought: Use weighted scoring system to combine individual factor scores
- Sub-thought: Machine Learning Approaches
  - Sub-thought: Feature Engineering
    - Sub-thought: Create lagged features from OHLCV data
    - Sub-thought: Include technical indicators as additional features
  - Sub-thought: Model Training
    - Sub-thought: Train a model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using engineered features
    - Sub-thought: Validate model performance using out-of-sample data
  - Sub-thought: Model Application
    - Sub-thought: Apply the trained model to make predictions on new data
    - Sub-thought: Refine and retrain the model periodically to adapt to changing market conditions
