Thought: Analyze historical price data for trend signals
- Sub-thought: Calculate moving averages to identify trends
  - Sub-thought: Short-term Moving Average (SMA_10) using close prices of the last 10 days
  - Sub-thought: Long-term Moving Average (SMA_50) using close prices of the last 50 days
  - Sub-thought: Determine the trend by comparing SMA_10 and SMA_50
    - If SMA_10 > SMA_50, indicate a bullish trend
    - If SMA_10 < SMA_50, indicate a bearish trend
- Sub-thought: Measure price volatility to assess market conditions
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) over the past 14 days
  - Sub-thought: Use ATR to determine the level of market volatility
    - If ATR is high, suggest caution due to increased volatility
    - If ATR is low, suggest a more stable market condition
- Sub-thought: Identify support and resistance levels
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the highest high and lowest low over the past 20 days
  - Sub-thought: Use these levels to predict potential reversal points
    - If the current price approaches the highest high, suggest a potential resistance
    - If the current price approaches the lowest low, suggest a potential support
- Sub-thought: Evaluate trading volume to gauge market interest
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the average volume over the past 30 days
  - Sub-thought: Compare the current day's volume to the average volume
    - If the current volume is significantly higher than the average, suggest strong market interest
    - If the current volume is significantly lower than the average, suggest weak market interest
- Sub-thought: Combine indicators to form a composite factor
  - Sub-thought: Assign weights to each indicator based on their predictive power
  - Sub-thought: Sum the weighted indicators to form a composite alpha factor
  - Sub-thought: Interpret the composite factor to predict future stock returns
    - If the composite factor is positive, predict a bullish trend
    - If the composite factor is negative, predict a bearish trend
