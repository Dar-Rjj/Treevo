  - Sub-thought: Explore the relationship between price actions and future returns
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_1 = high[t] - low[t]
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_2 = (close[t] - low[t]) / (high[t] - low[t])
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_7 = (close[t] - close[t-1]) / (high[t] - low[t])
  - Sub-thought: Investigate the impact of volume and amount on stock performance
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_3 = volume[t] / (high[t] - low[t])
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_4 = amount[t] / (high[t] - low[t])
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_8 = (volume[t] - volume[t-5]) / amount[t]

    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_11 = (high[t] - low[t-1]) / (high[t-1] - low[t-1])
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_12 = (high[t] - low[t]) / (high[t-5] - low[t-5])
  - Sub-thought: Combine Short-Term and Long-Term Momentum
    - Leaf thought: Define short_term_return = (close[t] / close[t-5]) - 1
    - Leaf thought: Define long_term_return = (close[t] / close[t-20]) - 1

  - Sub-thought: Identify Volume Spikes
    - Leaf thought: Define volume_spike_indicator = (volume[t] > (average_volume + 2 * volume_volatility)) ? 1 : 0
  - Sub-thought: Multiply Combined Return by Volume Spike Indicator
    - Leaf thought: Define spike_adjusted_return = combined_return * volume_spike_indicator
  - Sub-thought: Calculate VWAP
    - Leaf thought: Define vwap = (high[t] + low[t] + close[t]) / 3 * volume[t]
  - Sub-thought: Integrate Volume and Price Information
    - Leaf thought: Define volume_difference = volume[t] - volume[t-1]
    - Leaf thought: Define adjusted_close_change = close[t] - close[t-1]
    - Leaf thought: Define integrated_factor = (volume_difference * 0.6) + (average_high_low_range * 0.4) + adjusted_close_change
  - Sub-thought: Combine Indicators
    - Leaf thought: Define high_low_range_over_average = (high[t] - low[t]) / average_high_low_range
