    weighted_avg = df['open'] * 0.3 + df['close'] * 0.7
    
    # Calculate the money flow index (MFI) as the ratio of typical price to volume
    typical_price = (df['high'] + df['low'] + df['close']) / 3
    mfi = typical_price / df['volume']
    
    # The alpha factor is a combination of the weighted average and the MFI
    alpha_factor = (weighted_avg + mfi) / 2
