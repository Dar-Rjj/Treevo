Thought: Begin with basic technical indicators as potential alpha factors.
- Thought: Calculate the simple moving average of closing prices over a certain period.
  - Sub-Thought: Use a 5-day window for calculating the moving average.
  - Sub-Thought: Compare today's close price to the 5-day simple moving average (SMA) to generate a signal.
    - Sub-Thought: If today's close is above the SMA, output a positive value indicating a buy signal; otherwise, output a negative value indicating a sell signal.
- Thought: Consider momentum by examining the rate of change in closing prices over a specified duration.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in the closing price from 10 days ago to today.
  - Sub-Thought: Use this percentage change as an indicator, with larger positive values suggesting stronger upward momentum and vice versa.
- Thought: Explore the relationship between opening and closing prices as a predictor of future performance.
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between the daily close and open prices.
  - Sub-Thought: Assign a higher weight or value to days where the close is significantly higher than the open, indicating strong intraday positive momentum.
  - Sub-Thought: Create a cumulative sum of these differences over the past 20 trading days to capture longer-term trends.
- Thought: Utilize volume data to identify unusual trading activity that may signal upcoming price movements.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 20-day average trading volume.
  - Sub-Thought: On any given day, if the volume is significantly (e.g., 2 standard deviations) above this average, flag it as potentially significant.
  - Sub-Thought: Combine this volume anomaly with the sign of the day's return (positive or negative) to generate a more nuanced signal about the direction of the expected price movement.
- Thought: Investigate the volatility of the stock using the high and low prices.
  - Sub-Thought: For each day, calculate the range (high minus low).
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the 10-day moving average of these ranges.
  - Sub-Thought: Normalize the current day's range by dividing it by its 10-day moving average, avoiding the use of global statistics for normalization.
  - Sub-Thought: Interpret this normalized range as a measure of relative volatility, with higher values suggesting periods of increased uncertainty or opportunity.
