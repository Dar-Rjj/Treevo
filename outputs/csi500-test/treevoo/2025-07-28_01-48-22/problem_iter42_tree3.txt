Thought: Develop a base alpha factor using price and volume data.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the daily return as (close_t - close_{t-1}) / close_{t-1}.
    - Sub-sub-thought: Use this daily return as a simple alpha factor to predict future returns.
      - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Introduce a lagged version of the daily return, e.g., (close_{t-2} - close_{t-3}) / close_{t-3}.
        - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Combine the current and lagged daily returns in a weighted sum as a composite factor.
          - Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Experiment with different weights for the current and lagged returns to find the optimal combination.
  - Sub-thought: Create an alpha factor based on the high-low range.
    - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the high-low range as (high_t - low_t).
      - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Use the high-low range as a direct alpha factor to predict market volatility or momentum.
        - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Introduce a moving average of the high-low range over a fixed window, e.g., 5 days.
          - Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Use the ratio of the current high-low range to its moving average as a measure of volatility.
            - Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Explore different window sizes for the moving average to capture various time horizons.
  - Sub-thought: Incorporate volume into the alpha factors.
    - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the volume change as (volume_t - volume_{t-1}).
      - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Use the volume change as a standalone alpha factor to identify significant trading activity.
        - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Create a composite factor by combining the volume change with the daily return.
          - Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Introduce a lagged version of the volume change, e.g., (volume_{t-2} - volume_{t-3}).
            - Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Combine the current and lagged volume changes in a weighted sum as a composite factor.
  - Sub-thought: Explore interactions between different factors.
    - Sub-sub-thought: Combine the daily return, high-low range, and volume change in a multivariate model.
      - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Use a linear combination of these factors, e.g., w1 * daily_return + w2 * high_low_range + w3 * volume_change.
        - Sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Consider non-linear combinations, such as product or exponential functions, to capture complex relationships.
          - Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-thought: Evaluate the performance of the non-linear combinations using out-of-sample data.
