- Exploring Momentum Factors
  - Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate 50-day SMA (SMA_50) using close prices
    - Calculate 200-day SMA (SMA_200) using close prices
    - Generate alpha factor: (SMA_50 - SMA_200) / SMA_200
  - Exponential Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate 50-day EMA (EMA_50) using close prices
    - Calculate 200-day EMA (EMA_200) using close prices
    - Generate alpha factor: (EMA_50 - EMA_200) / EMA_200
- Analyzing Volume Indicators
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Initialize OBV at 0
    - For each day, if close > previous close, OBV += volume; else if close < previous close, OBV -= volume
    - Generate alpha factor: OBV / (average volume over 30 days)
  - Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Calculate daily VWAP as (close * volume) / volume
    - Calculate 30-day cumulative VWAP
    - Generate alpha factor: (current close - 30-day VWAP) / 30-day VWAP
- Investigating Volatility Factors
  - True Range (TR)
    - Calculate TR as max(high - low, abs(high - previous close), abs(low - previous close))
    - Generate alpha factor: average TR over 14 days
  - Average True Range (ATR)
    - Calculate ATR as the moving average of TR over 14 days
    - Generate alpha factor: ATR
- Examining Price Patterns
  - Inside Bar Pattern
    - Identify inside bar pattern where high < previous high and low > previous low
    - Generate binary alpha factor: 1 if inside bar pattern, 0 otherwise
  - Engulfing Pattern
    - Identify bullish engulfing pattern where today's open < today's close, yesterday's open > yesterday's close, and today's high > yesterday's high, and today's low < yesterday's low
    - Generate binary alpha factor: 1 if bullish engulfing pattern, 0 otherwise
- Evaluating Market Sentiment
  - High-Low Ratio
    - Calculate the ratio of high to low prices
    - Generate alpha factor: (high - low) / low
  - Close-Open Spread
    - Calculate the difference between close and open prices
    - Generate alpha factor: (close - open) / open
- Incorporating Financial Ratios
  - Price-to-Volume Ratio
    - Calculate the ratio of close price to volume
    - Generate alpha factor: close / volume
  - Price Change Ratio
    - Calculate the percentage change in close price from the previous day
    - Generate alpha factor: (close - previous close) / previous close
