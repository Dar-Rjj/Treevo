Thought: Enhance alpha factor generation by incorporating additional price and volume dynamics
  - Sub-thought: Explore the relationship between price actions and future returns
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_1 = high[t] - low[t]
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_2 = (close[t] - low[t]) / (high[t] - low[t])
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_7 = (close[t] - close[t-1]) / (high[t] - low[t])
  - Sub-thought: Investigate the impact of volume and amount on stock performance
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_3 = volume[t] / (high[t] - low[t])
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_4 = amount[t] / (high[t] - low[t])
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_8 = (volume[t] - volume[t-5]) / amount[t]
  - Sub-thought: Examine the momentum using past close prices
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_5 = (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5]
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_9 = (close[t] - open[t-1]) / open[t-1]
  - Sub-thought: Consider the trend direction and strength
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_6 = (open[t] < close[t]) ? 1 : (open[t] > close[t]) ? -1 : 0
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_10 = (high[t] - high[t-1]) - (low[t] - low[t-1])
  - Sub-thought: Analyze the volatility and its impact on returns
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_11 = (high[t] - low[t-1]) / (high[t-1] - low[t-1])
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_12 = (high[t] - low[t]) / (high[t-5] - low[t-5])
