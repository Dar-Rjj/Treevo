Thought: Synthesize technical indicators and hybrid alpha factors to generate a robust predictive model for future stock returns.
- Thought: Begin with weighted moving average as a foundational indicator.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 5-day weighted moving average (WMA) of closing prices, with more weight on recent prices.
  - Sub-Thought: Compare today's close price to the 5-day WMA to generate a signal.
    - Sub-Thought: If today's close is above the WMA, output a positive value; otherwise, output a negative value.
- Thought: Incorporate momentum indicators to capture price trends.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the short-term return (Close_t / Close_{t-5}) - 1.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the long-term return (Close_t / Close_{t-20}) - 1.
  - Sub-Thought: Combine the short-term and long-term returns to create a momentum score.
- Thought: Integrate intraday and historical momentum components.
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the intraday momentum component as (Close - Open) / Open * Volume.
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the historical momentum component as Close - Close_10_days_ago.
  - Sub-Thought: Add the intraday and historical momentum components.
  - Sub-Thought: Apply an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over 5 days to smooth the combined momentum.
- Thought: Adjust momentum based on volume and volatility.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 20-day volume volatility as the standard deviation of 20-day volume changes.
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the average volume over the last 10 days.
  - Sub-Thought: Adjust the momentum score by dividing the 20-day momentum by the 20-day volume volatility and multiplying by the average volume.
- Thought: Consider relative strength as a measure of trend consistency.
  - Sub-Thought: Subtract the long-term return from the short-term return to get the relative strength.
- Thought: Utilize high-low range to measure intraday volatility.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily high-low range as High - Low.
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the 5-day average high-low range.
  - Sub-Thought: Divide the current day's high-low range by the 5-day average to get the relative range.
- Thought: Combine intraday and open-to-close returns.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the intraday return as High_t - Low_t.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the open-to-close return as Close_t - Open_t.
  - Sub-Thought: Add the intraday return and open-to-close return.
- Thought: Identify significant volume spikes to flag potential price movements.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the standard deviation of volume over N days.
  - Sub-Thought: If the current volume is greater than (mean volume + K * standard deviation), set a volume spike indicator to 1; otherwise, set it to 0.
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply the combined return by the volume spike indicator.
- Thought: Integrate volume and price information.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the volume difference as Volume_t - Volume_{t-1}.
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the VWAP as (High + Low + Close) / 3 * Volume.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the volume-to-VWAP ratio.
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply the volume difference by a constant (e.g., 0.6).
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply the average high-low range by a constant (e.g., 0.4).
  - Sub-Thought: Add the adjusted close change (Close_t - Close_{t-1}).
- Thought: Combine all indicators to form the final alpha factor.
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply the relative range by the volume difference.
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply the result by the volume-to-VWAP ratio.
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply the intermediate result by the close-to-previous close return.
  - Sub-Thought: Output the final factor value.
- Thought: Weight the final factor by volume and volatility.
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the volume average as the sum of volumes from t-4 to t divided by 5.
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the volatility as the standard deviation of the daily returns for the past 20 days.
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply the relative strength by (volume average * volatility).
