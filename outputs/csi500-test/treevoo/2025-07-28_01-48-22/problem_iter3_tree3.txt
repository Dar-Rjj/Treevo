Price and Volume Dynamic Interaction Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Daily Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Compute as (Close_t - Close_{t-5}) / Close_{t-5}
├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Volume
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Apply EMA over 5 days
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Multiply Daily Price Momentum by EMA of Volume
│   └── Interpret as the momentum adjusted for trading volume
└── Calculate Enhanced Price and Volume Interaction Signal
    ├── Use Open, High, Low, and Close prices
    └── Compute as (High_t - Low_t) * (Close_t - Open_t) / (Volume_t + 1)
        ├── Interpret as a measure of price range and intraday volatility
        └── Adjust for the trading volume with a small constant to avoid division by zero
