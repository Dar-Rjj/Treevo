```python
def heuristics_v2(df):
    # Calculate the average of the open and close prices
    avg_price = (df['open'] + df['close']) / 2
    
    # Calculate the ratio of the volume to the amount, which gives a sense of the price per unit volume
    price_per_volume = df['amount'] / df['volume']
    
    # Calculate the volatility of the day by taking the range of the high and low divided by the average price
    daily_volatility = (df['high'] - df['low']) / avg_price
    
    # Define the factor: if the price per volume is above its mean, it indicates higher than usual demand, 
    # thus we expect positive return. We multiply this with the daily volatility to scale the factor,
    # giving more weight to days with higher volatility.
    factor = (price_per_volume > price_per_volume.mean()) * daily_volatility

    return factor
