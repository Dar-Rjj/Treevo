  - Sub-thought: Explore the relationship between price actions and future returns
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_1 = high[t] - low[t]
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_2 = (close[t] - low[t]) / (high[t] - low[t])
  - Sub-thought: Investigate the impact of volume and amount on stock performance
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_3 = volume[t] / (high[t] - low[t])
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_4 = amount[t] / (high[t] - low[t])
  - Sub-thought: Examine the momentum using past close prices
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_5 = (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5]
  - Sub-thought: Consider the trend direction and strength
    - Leaf thought: Define alpha_factor_6 = (open[t] < close[t]) ? 1 : (open[t] > close[t]) ? -1 : 0
