Thought: Begin with enhanced technical indicators as potential alpha factors.
- Thought: Calculate the weighted moving average (WMA) of closing prices over a 5-day window.
  - Sub-Thought: Generate a signal by comparing today's close price to the 5-day WMA.
    - If today's close is above the WMA, output a positive value indicating a buy signal; otherwise, output a negative value indicating a sell signal.
- Thought: Consider momentum by examining the rate of change in closing prices.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the combined percentage change in the closing price from 10 and 20 days ago to today.
    - Use this combined percentage change as an indicator, with larger positive values suggesting stronger upward momentum and vice versa.
- Thought: Explore the relationship between opening and closing prices.
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the cumulative sum of the difference between daily close and open prices over the past 20 trading days.
    - Introduce a smoothing factor to the cumulative sum to highlight significant trends.
- Thought: Utilize volume data to identify unusual trading activity.
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the 20-day average trading volume.
  - Sub-Thought: Flag any day with volume significantly (e.g., 3 standard deviations) above the average.
    - Combine this volume anomaly with the sign of the day's return and the direction of the 5-day WMA to generate a nuanced signal about the expected price movement.
- Thought: Investigate the volatility using high and low prices.
  - Sub-Thought: For each day, calculate the range (high minus low).
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the 10-day moving average of these ranges.
  - Sub-Thought: Interpret the relative range (current day's range divided by its 10-day moving average) as a measure of relative volatility.
    - Higher values suggest increased uncertainty or opportunity.
