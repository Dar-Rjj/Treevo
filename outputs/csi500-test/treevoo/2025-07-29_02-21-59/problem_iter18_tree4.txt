Alpha Mining for Predicting Future Stock Returns
- Technical Indicators
  - Moving Averages
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA): Calculate the SMA of the close prices over a specific period.
      - SMA Crossover: Generate a signal when the short-term SMA crosses above or below the long-term SMA.
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Calculate the EMA of the close prices with an emphasis on recent data.
  - Momentum Indicators
    - Rate of Change (ROC): Measure the percentage change in the close price from one period to another.
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI): Calculate the RSI to determine overbought or oversold conditions.
- Volume-Based Indicators
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV): Track buying and selling pressure by accumulating volume on up days and subtracting on down days.
  - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF): Calculate the CMF to measure buying and selling pressure based on volume and price.
- Price Pattern Indicators
  - Bollinger Bands
    - Upper Band: Calculate the upper band as the SMA plus a multiple of the standard deviation.
    - Lower Band: Calculate the lower band as the SMA minus a multiple of the standard deviation.
    - Bandwidth: Calculate the difference between the upper and lower bands to measure volatility.
  - Donchian Channels
    - Upper Channel: Determine the highest high over a specified period.
    - Lower Channel: Determine the lowest low over a specified period.
    - Middle Channel: Calculate the average of the upper and lower channels.
- Advanced Indicators
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
    - Line: Calculate the difference between the 12-day and 26-day EMAs.
    - Signal: Calculate the 9-day EMA of the MACD line.
    - Histogram: Calculate the difference between the MACD line and the signal line.
  - KDJ (Stochastic Oscillator)
    - K: Calculate the %K line as the ratio of the current close price minus the lowest low over a specified period, divided by the difference between the highest high and the lowest low.
    - D: Calculate the %D line as a 3-period SMA of the %K.
- Custom Indicators
  - Price-Volume Ratio
    - Calculate the ratio of the close price to the volume.
    - Use this ratio to identify potential turning points in the market.
  - High-Low Range
    - Calculate the range as the difference between the high and low prices.
    - Use this range to measure daily volatility.
- Combined Indicators
  - Moving Average + Volume
    - Create a combined indicator that combines the SMA and OBV to identify strong trends.
  - RSI + Bollinger Bands
    - Combine the RSI with Bollinger Bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions within a volatile environment.
