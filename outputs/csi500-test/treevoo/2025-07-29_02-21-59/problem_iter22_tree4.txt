- Explore basic price patterns
  - Calculate simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices
  - Calculate exponential moving average (EMA) of closing prices
  - Determine the difference between EMA and SMA
- Analyze price change dynamics
  - Compute daily return as (close_t / close_{t-1}) - 1
  - Calculate the sum of positive daily returns over a fixed period
  - Calculate the sum of negative daily returns over a fixed period
  - Determine the ratio of positive to negative returns
- Evaluate volume trends
  - Calculate the change in volume compared to the previous day
  - Identify days with significant volume changes (e.g., more than 20% increase)
  - Count the number of such high-volume change days within a fixed period
- Combine price and volume indicators
  - Calculate the product of the difference between EMA and SMA and the volume change
  - Determine the weighted sum of daily returns, where weights are based on the volume
- Investigate high and low price movements
  - Calculate the range (high - low) for each day
  - Compute the ratio of the range to the closing price
  - Identify days with unusually high ranges (e.g., more than 2 standard deviations from the mean)
- Analyze the relationship between opening and closing prices
  - Calculate the gap (open_t - close_{t-1})
  - Determine the direction of the gap (positive or negative)
  - Count the number of consecutive days with gaps in the same direction
