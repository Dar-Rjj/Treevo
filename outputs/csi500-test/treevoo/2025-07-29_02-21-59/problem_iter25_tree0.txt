Thought: Calculate the difference between today's closing price and yesterday's closing price.
  Subthought: Use the difference as a basic momentum indicator. If positive, it indicates upward momentum; if negative, downward momentum.
    Subthought: Extend the momentum indicator by calculating the difference over a 5-day window (today's close - close from 5 days ago).
      Subthought: Consider the 5-day momentum change as a secondary factor to gauge the strength of the trend.
        Subthought: Introduce a conditional factor based on whether the 5-day momentum is increasing or decreasing compared to the previous day's 5-day momentum.
          Subthought: If the 5-day momentum is increasing, assign a higher score; if decreasing, assign a lower score.
            Subthought: Use this score to predict future returns, where a higher score suggests a stronger upward trend.
  Subthought: Incorporate the volume into the momentum calculation.
    Subthought: Calculate the volume-weighted momentum by multiplying the price difference with the volume and summing over the past 5 days.
      Subthought: Use the volume-weighted momentum as a more robust indicator, giving more weight to days with higher trading volume.
  Subthought: Analyze the open and close prices.
    Subthought: Calculate the number of days in the past 5 days where the close price was higher than the open price (up days).
      Subthought: Use the count of up days as an indicator of the market sentiment.
        Subthought: Combine the up days count with the momentum indicator to create a sentiment-adjusted momentum factor.
          Subthought: If both the momentum is positive and the number of up days is high, suggest a strong buy signal.
          Subthought: If the momentum is positive but the number of up days is low, suggest caution despite the positive momentum.
