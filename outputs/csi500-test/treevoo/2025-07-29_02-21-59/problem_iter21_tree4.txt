- Begin with the foundational data: open, high, low, close prices, amount, and volume available up to day t.
  - Calculate Price Momentum Indicators
    - Compute the rate of change (ROC) over a specified period (e.g., 5 days): ROC = [(Close_t / Close_(t-5)) - 1] * 100
      - Explore the impact of varying periods on ROC's predictive power for returns.
    - Determine the average directional index (ADX) using the difference between moving averages of positive and negative direction indicators. 
      - ADX = |(Positive Directional Indicator - Negative Directional Indicator) / Days|
      - Delve into different lookback periods for ADX calculation.
  - Develop Volume-Based Features
    - Introduce the On-Balance Volume (OBV) to measure buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days.
      - OBV_t = OBV_(t-1) + Volume_t if Close_t > Close_(t-1), else OBV_(t-1) - Volume_t
      - Analyze the effect of short-term vs. long-term OBV trends.
    - Create a Volume Surge Indicator by comparing today's volume to the average volume over a given period (e.g., 20 days). 
      - Volume_Surge = (Volume_t / Average(Volume_(t-20)_to_Volume_t-1)) - 1
      - Investigate the significance of different averaging windows.
  - Design Pattern Recognition Strategies
    - Identify simple candlestick patterns such as Doji, Hammer, or Shooting Star using Open, High, Low, Close values.
      - For example, a Doji pattern is detected when the opening and closing prices are nearly equal.
      - Experiment with combining multiple simple patterns into more complex signals.
    - Implement breakout strategies based on price action, where a breakout occurs if the price crosses above a recent high or below a recent low.
      - Breakout_High = If(Close_t > Max(High_(t-9)_to_High_t-1), 1, 0)
      - Similarly, define a breakout on the downside.
  - Incorporate Financial Ratios and Indicators
    - Although not directly related to price or volume, consider incorporating financial statement ratios like Earnings Per Share (EPS) or Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio as static factors, assuming they can be updated daily.
      - EPS_Trend = (EPS_t / EPS_(t-1)) - 1
      - P/E_Ratio_Change = (P/E_t - P/E_(t-1))
      - Explore how these metrics complement the technical indicators in predicting stock performance.
  - Combine and Evaluate Alpha Factors
    - Construct a composite alpha factor by weighting individual components derived from the above strategies.
      - Weighting could be uniform or based on historical backtesting performance of each component.
    - Continuously backtest the effectiveness of the combined alpha factors across different market conditions and time frames to refine the model.
