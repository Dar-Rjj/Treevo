Alpha Mining for Predicting Future Stock Returns
- Technical Indicators
  - Moving Averages
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA): Calculate the SMA of the close prices over a specific period.
      - SMA Crossover: Generate a signal when the short-term SMA crosses above or below the long-term SMA.
      - SMA Slope: Calculate the slope of the SMA to determine the trend direction.
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Calculate the EMA of the close prices with an emphasis on recent data.
      - EMA Crossover: Generate a signal when the short-term EMA crosses above or below the long-term EMA.
      - EMA Slope: Calculate the slope of the EMA to determine the trend direction.
  - Momentum Indicators
    - Rate of Change (ROC): Measure the percentage change in the close price from one period to another.
      - ROC Slope: Calculate the slope of the ROC to determine the momentum trend.
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI): Calculate the RSI to determine overbought or oversold conditions.
      - RSI Slope: Calculate the slope of the RSI to identify changes in buying or selling pressure.
- Volume-Based Indicators
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV): Track buying and selling pressure by accumulating volume on up days and subtracting on down days.
    - OBV Crossover: Generate a signal when the OBV crosses above or below its moving average.
  - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF): Calculate the CMF to measure buying and selling pressure based on volume and price.
    - CMF Crossover: Generate a signal when the CMF crosses above or below zero.
- Price Pattern Indicators
  - Bollinger Bands
    - Upper Band: Calculate the upper band as the SMA plus a multiple of the standard deviation.
    - Lower Band: Calculate the lower band as the SMA minus a multiple of the standard deviation.
    - Bandwidth: Calculate the difference between the upper and lower bands to measure volatility.
    - %B Indicator: Calculate the current close price's position relative to the Bollinger Bands.
  - Donchian Channels
    - Upper Channel: Determine the highest high over a specified period.
    - Lower Channel: Determine the lowest low over a specified period.
    - Middle Channel: Calculate the average of the upper and lower channels.
    - Donchian Breakout: Generate a signal when the close price breaks above the upper channel or below the lower channel.
- Advanced Indicators
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
    - Line: Calculate the difference between the 12-day and 26-day EMAs.
    - Signal: Calculate the 9-day EMA of the MACD line.
    - Histogram: Calculate the difference between the MACD line and the signal line.
    - MACD Crossover: Generate a signal when the MACD line crosses above or below the signal line.
  - KDJ (Stochastic Oscillator)
    - K: Calculate the %K line as the ratio of the current close price minus the lowest low over a specified period, divided by the difference between the highest high and the lowest low.
    - D: Calculate the %D line as a 3-period SMA of the %K.
    - J: Calculate the %J line as 3 * %K - 2 * %D.
    - KDJ Crossover: Generate a signal when the %K line crosses above or below the %D line.
- Custom Indicators
  - Price-Volume Ratio
    - Calculate the ratio of the close price to the volume.
    - Use this ratio to identify potential turning points in the market.
    - Price-Volume Trend: Calculate the trend of the price-volume ratio to identify changes in market sentiment.
  - High-Low Range
    - Calculate the range as the difference between the high and low prices.
    - Use this range to measure daily volatility.
    - High-Low Range Expansion: Calculate the expansion of the high-low range to identify increasing volatility.
- Combined Indicators
  - Moving Average + Volume
    - Create a combined indicator that combines the SMA and OBV to identify strong trends.
    - SMA-OBV Divergence: Identify divergences between the SMA and OBV to predict trend reversals.
  - RSI + Bollinger Bands
    - Combine the RSI with Bollinger Bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions within a volatile environment.
    - RSI-BB Crossover: Generate a signal when the RSI crosses above or below the Bollinger Bands.
