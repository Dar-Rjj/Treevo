  - Sub-sub-thought: Max(High - Low, Abs(High - Previous Close), Abs(Low - Previous Close))
- Sub-thought: Average True Range (ATR)
  - Sub-sub-thought: ATR from True Range

Thought: Evaluate Trading Activity
- Sub-thought: Money Flow Index (MFI)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3

- Sub-thought: Stochastic Oscillator
  - Sub-sub-thought: %K = (Current Close - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low)
  - Sub-sub-thought: %D = 3-day SMA of %K
