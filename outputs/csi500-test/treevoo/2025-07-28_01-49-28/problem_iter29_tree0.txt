Thought: Synthesize Price, Volume, and Amount for Enhanced Alpha Factor Generation
- Sub-thought: Analyze Price Action and Volume for Trend and Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Daily Range and Open-to-Close Movement
    - Sub-thought: Use (high - low) as a raw volatility factor
    - Sub-thought: Calculate (close - open) / (high - low) as a raw price movement factor
  - Sub-thought: Assess Volume Changes and Market Sentiment
    - Sub-thought: Compute today's volume - yesterday's volume as a raw volume change factor
    - Sub-thought: Calculate (volume * (close - open)) as a raw volume-price interaction factor
- Sub-thought: Combine Price and Volume for Complex Factors
  - Sub-thought: Summarize (close - open) * volume over the last 5 days as a raw price-volume composite factor
  - Sub-thought: Investigate Price Gaps
    - Sub-thought: Calculate (open - previous close) as a raw gap factor
- Sub-thought: Incorporate Money Flow and Transaction Size
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of positive to total money flow
    - Sub-thought: Define positive money flow as (close - open) * volume when close > open, otherwise 0
    - Sub-thought: Define total money flow as (close - open) * volume, regardless of price direction
    - Sub-thought: Use the ratio as a raw money flow index
  - Sub-thought: Calculate (amount / volume) as a raw transaction size factor
- Sub-thought: Integrate High-Low Spread and Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Moving Sum of High-Low Spreads over Last 20 Days
  - Sub-thought: Subtract Previous Day's Moving Sum from Current Day's Moving Sum as Spread Momentum
- Sub-thought: Adjust for 10-Day High and Low Prices
  - Sub-thought: Identify 10-Day High and Low Prices
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Proximity to 10-Day High and Low
    - Sub-thought: Minimum Proximity
    - Sub-thought: Invert Value
  - Sub-thought: Adjust for 20-Day Volatility
    - Sub-thought: Divide Inverted Proximity by 20-Day Standard Deviation
- Sub-thought: Volume-Adjusted Momentum with Open-to-Close Movement
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Simple Momentum for Close Prices
    - Sub-thought: Subtract Close price (t-n) from Close price (t)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Average Volume (t to t-n)
  - Sub-thought: Adjusted Momentum by Volume
    - Sub-thought: Multiply Simple Momentum by (Volume (t) / Average Volume (t to t-n))
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Open-to-Close Movement
    - Sub-thought: Subtract Open price (t) from Close price (t)
  - Sub-thought: Combine Indicators
    - Sub-thought: Weighted Sum of Adjusted Momentum and Open-to-Close Movement
    - Sub-thought: Filter for Strong Moves
      - Sub-thought: Return 1 if Combined Indicator is above Threshold, 0 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Enhance with Amount per Unit Close Price Rate of Change
  - Sub-thought: Sum of Amounts over past n days (t to t-n, where n > 0)
  - Sub-thought: Divide sum by Close price (t)
  - Sub-thought: Same Ratio for Previous Period (t-(n+1) to t-2*n)
  - Sub-thought: Differential Between the Ratios
- Sub-thought: Final Alpha Factor Composition
  - Sub-thought: Adjusted Daily Range * Enhanced Reversion * Open-High-Low Volatility * Spread Momentum * Adjusted Momentum * High-Low Return * Strong Move Indicator * Amount per Unit Close Price Rate of Change
