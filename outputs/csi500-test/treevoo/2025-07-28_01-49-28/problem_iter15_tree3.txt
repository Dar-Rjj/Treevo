Thought: Develop basic alpha factors using price and volume data
- Sub-thought: Calculate simple moving averages for close prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Define a short-term moving average (e.g., 5 days) of close prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Define a medium-term moving average (e.g., 20 days) of close prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Define a long-term moving average (e.g., 60 days) of close prices
- Sub-thought: Generate indicators based on the difference between high and low prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute daily range as (High - Low)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the average daily range over a fixed period (e.g., 10 days)
- Sub-thought: Create momentum indicators from closing prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the rate of change of closing prices over a fixed period (e.g., 10 days)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Determine the relative strength by comparing the closing price to its n-day (e.g., 10 days) minimum
- Sub-thought: Analyze volume patterns
  - Sub-sub-thought: Identify days with unusually high volume, defined as volume exceeding its 30-day moving average by a certain percentage (e.g., 20%)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the cumulative volume over a recent period (e.g., 5 days) and compare it to the same measure over a longer past period (e.g., 20 days) to gauge trend strength
- Sub-thought: Incorporate open and close price dynamics
  - Sub-sub-thought: Define a factor based on the ratio of Close to Open
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create an indicator that counts the number of days in a row where the closing price is above the opening price, resetting the count on any day that does not meet this condition
- Sub-thought: Combine indicators to create complex alpha signals
  - Sub-sub-thought: Develop a composite signal by combining the momentum with the volume surge flag
  - Sub-sub-thought: Integrate the short-term and long-term moving averages with the relative strength to produce a multi-factor score
