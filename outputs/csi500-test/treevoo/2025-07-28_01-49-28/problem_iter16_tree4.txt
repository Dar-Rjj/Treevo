├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High to get Spread
├── Incorporate Volume
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Spread by Volume
│   └── Label as Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
├── Calculate Weighted Momentum
│   ├── Subtract previous Close from current Close to get Momentum
│   ├── Multiply Momentum by Volume
│   └── Label as Volume-Weighted Momentum
├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average of Momentum
│   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with a 10-day span on Volume-Weighted Momentum
│   └── Label as EMA-Momentum
├── Calculate Price Change Ratio
│   ├── Divide Close by Open to get Price Change Ratio
├── Calculate Relative Strength Index (RSI)
│   ├── Calculate Daily Returns
│   ├── Separate Positive and Negative Returns
│   ├── Calculate Smoothed Average Gains and Losses with 14-day EMA
│   ├── Calculate Relative Strength by dividing Average Gains by Average Losses
│   ├── Use formula: 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

├── Proximity to 10-Day Range
│   ├── Find 10-Day High and Low Prices
│   │   ├── Highest High in 10 Days
│   │   └── Lowest Low in 10 Days
│   ├── Calculate Distance to 10-Day High and Low
│   ├── Invert Minimum Proximity
│   ├── Divide Inverted Proximity by 20-Day Standard Deviation of Daily Returns
│   └── Label as Adjusted Proximity
├── Combine Factors
