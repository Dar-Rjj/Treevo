Thought: Develop trend-following alpha factor
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate short-term moving average (SMA) of closing prices over last 5 days
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate long-term moving average (LMA) of closing prices over last 20 days
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between LMA and SMA to identify trend
    - Sub-Thought: Positive difference indicates an upward trend; negative, a downward trend
  - Sub-Thought: Factor value is the difference between LMA and SMA

Thought: Develop momentum-based alpha factor using price change
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing prices from t-1 to t
  - Sub-Thought: Smooth the percentage change by computing the moving average of the last 10 days
  - Sub-Thought: Momentum factor value is the smoothed percentage change

Thought: Develop volatility-based alpha factor
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily range by subtracting low from high
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the moving average of the daily range over the past 14 days
  - Sub-Thought: Volatility factor value is the moving average of the daily range
```

```txt
Thought: Develop volume-weighted alpha factor
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for each day
    - Sub-Thought: VWAP = (sum(volume * close) / sum(volume))
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the moving average of VWAP over the past 7 days
  - Sub-Thought: Volume-weighted factor value is the moving average of VWAP

```txt
Thought: Develop gap-based alpha factor
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the overnight gap by subtracting the previous day's close from the current day's open
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the moving average of the overnight gap over the past 5 days
  - Sub-Thought: Gap factor value is the moving average of the overnight gap
