Integrated and Enhanced Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength, Momentum, and Reversion
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength
│   ├── Daily Range: High - Low
│   ├── Open-to-Close Movement: Close - Open
│   └── Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength: (Daily Range * Volume) + Open-to-Close Movement
├── Volume-Weighted Average Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High to get Spread
│   ├── Calculate Weighted Average Volume
│   │   ├── Sum of Volumes over past n days (t to t-n, where n > 0)
│   │   └── Divide by n to get Average Volume
│   └── Multiply Spread by Weighted Average Volume
│       └── Label as Volume-Weighted Average Spread
├── Integrated Momentum Factor
│   ├── Simple Momentum
│   │   ├── Close price (t)
│   │   └── Close price (t-n, where n > 0)
│   └── Adjusted Momentum by Volume
│       ├── Weighted Average Volume (t to t-n)
│       └── Multiply Simple Momentum by Weighted Average Volume
├── Enhanced Price Reversion
│   ├── 10-Day High: Max(High, last 10 days)
│   ├── 10-Day Low: Min(Low, last 10 days)
│   ├── Proximity to 10-Day High: 10-Day High - Current Close
│   ├── Proximity to 10-Day Low: Current Close - 10-Day Low
│   ├── Minimum Proximity: Min(Proximity to 10-Day High, Proximity to 10-Day Low)
│   ├── Inverted Proximity: 1 / Minimum Proximity
│   └── Adjusted Reversion: Inverted Proximity / 20-Day Standard Deviation of Daily Returns
├── Integrate Open-High-Low Volatility
│   ├── Open-High Difference: High - Open
│   ├── Open-Low Difference: Open - Low
│   └── Weighted Average by Volume: (Open-High Difference + Open-Low Difference) / 2 * Volume
├── Combined Momentum and High-Low Return
│   └── Sum of Adjusted Momentum and High-to-Low Return
│       ├── High-to-Low Range: High - Low
│       └── High-to-Low Return: High-to-Low Range / Previous Close
├── Amount per Unit Close Price Rate of Change
│   ├── Sum of Amounts over past n days (t to t-n, where n > 0)
│   ├── Divide sum by Close price (t)
│   ├── Same Ratio for Previous Period (t-(n+1) to t-2*n)
│   └── Differential Between the Ratios
├── Price Change Ratio
│   └── Divide Close by Open to get Price Change Ratio
├── Final Alpha Factor
│   ├── Add Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength to Volume-Weighted Average Spread
│   ├── Add Volume-Weighted Momentum to the Sum
│   ├── Add Combined Momentum and High-Low Return to the Result
│   ├── Add Open-High-Low Volatility to the Result
│   ├── Add Amount per Unit Close Price Rate of Change to the Result
│   ├── Multiply the Result by Price Change Ratio
│   ├── Multiply the Result by Enhanced Price Reversion
│   └── Label as Final Alpha Factor
└── Filter for Strong Moves
    ├── Check if Final Alpha Factor is above Threshold
    └── Return 1 if True, 0 otherwise
