Thought 1: Trend Following
    Thought 1.1: Moving Average Crossover
        Thought 1.1.1: Calculate the 5-day simple moving average (SMA5) of closing prices.
        Thought 1.1.2: Calculate the 20-day simple moving average (SMA20) of closing prices.
        Thought 1.1.3: Determine if SMA5 is above or below SMA20.
            Thought 1.1.3.1: If SMA5 > SMA20, assign a positive score.
            Thought 1.1.3.2: If SMA5 < SMA20, assign a negative score.
    Thought 1.2: Momentum
        Thought 1.2.1: Calculate the percentage change in closing price over the last 5 days.
        Thought 1.2.2: Assign a positive score if the 5-day momentum is positive, and a negative score if it is negative.

Thought 2: Volume and Price Relationship
    Thought 2.1: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
        Thought 2.1.1: Calculate the OBV by summing up the volume on days when the closing price is higher than the previous day's close and subtracting the volume on days when the closing price is lower than the previous day's close.
        Thought 2.1.2: Assign a positive score if the OBV is increasing, and a negative score if the OBV is decreasing.
    Thought 2.2: Price-Volume Trend (PVT)
        Thought 2.2.1: Calculate the PVT by summing up the product of the daily percentage change in closing price and the daily volume.
        Thought 2.2.2: Assign a positive score if the PVT is increasing, and a negative score if the PVT is decreasing.

Thought 3: Volatility
    Thought 3.1: True Range
        Thought 3.1.1: Calculate the true range as the maximum of (high - low), (high - previous close), and (previous close - low).
        Thought 3.1.2: Calculate the 14-day average true range (ATR14).
        Thought 3.1.3: Assign a positive score if the ATR14 is increasing, and a negative score if the ATR14 is decreasing.
    Thought 3.2: Bollinger Bands
        Thought 3.2.1: Calculate the 20-day simple moving average (SMA20) of closing prices.
        Thought 3.2.2: Calculate the 20-day standard deviation (SD20) of closing prices.
        Thought 3.2.3: Calculate the upper Bollinger Band as SMA20 + 2 * SD20.
        Thought 3.2.4: Calculate the lower Bollinger Band as SMA20 - 2 * SD20.
        Thought 3.2.5: Assign a positive score if the closing price is near the upper Bollinger Band, and a negative score if the closing price is near the lower Bollinger Band.
