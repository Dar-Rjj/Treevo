- Calculate daily return (close_t / close_t-1 - 1)
  - Use the daily return as a factor to predict future returns
- Calculate daily range (high_t - low_t)
  - Use the daily range as a factor to predict future volatility
    - High volatility may indicate future price movement
- Calculate intraday momentum (close_t - open_t)
  - Use the intraday momentum as a factor to assess short-term trend
    - Positive momentum may suggest continued upward movement
- Calculate volume-to-price ratio (volume_t / close_t)
  - Use the volume-to-price ratio as a factor to gauge market interest
    - High ratio may indicate strong market interest, potentially leading to price changes
- Calculate closing price deviation from moving average
  - Use the deviation as a mean reversion or trend-following factor
    - Large positive deviation may signal a potential mean reversion
- Calculate high-low range over n days
  - Use the high-low range as a factor to measure long-term volatility
    - High range may suggest increased future price volatility
- Calculate amount traded (close_t * volume_t)
  - Use the amount traded as a factor to assess market activity
    - High amount traded may indicate significant market activity and potential price movements
- Calculate change in volume (volume_t - volume_t-1)
  - Use the change in volume as a factor to identify shifts in market interest
    - Sudden increase in volume may signal a potential change in price direction
- Calculate cumulative return over n days
  - Use the cumulative return as a factor to capture medium-term trends
    - Positive cumulative return may indicate a continuing bullish trend
- Calculate volume weighted average price (VWAP) over n days
  - Use the VWAP as a factor to determine the average price paid for the stock
    - Price above VWAP may indicate a bullish trend
- Calculate relative strength (close_t / close_t-n)
  - Use the relative strength as a factor to compare current price with past prices
    - High relative strength may indicate a strong uptrend
- Calculate money flow (amount_t - amount_t-1)
  - Use the money flow as a factor to assess the direction of capital
    - Positive money flow may indicate buying pressure
- Calculate on-balance volume (OBV) over n days
  - Use the OBV as a factor to track the accumulation and distribution of volume
    - Rising OBV may indicate increasing buying pressure
- Calculate the ratio of close to high (close_t / high_t)
  - Use the ratio to assess the day's closing strength
    - High ratio may indicate a strong closing price
- Calculate the ratio of close to low (close_t / low_t)
  - Use the ratio to assess the day's closing weakness
    - Low ratio may indicate a weak closing price
- Calculate the ratio of open to close (open_t / close_t)
  - Use the ratio to assess the day's overall price movement
    - Ratio less than 1 may indicate a positive day
- Calculate the ratio of amount to volume (amount_t / volume_t)
  - Use the ratio to assess the average price at which the stock was traded
    - High ratio may indicate higher average trading price
- Calculate the standard deviation of close prices over n days
  - Use the standard deviation as a factor to measure price volatility
    - High standard deviation may indicate increased future price volatility
- Calculate the correlation between volume and close price over n days
  - Use the correlation as a factor to assess the relationship between volume and price
    - High positive correlation may indicate that volume is driving price
- Calculate the rate of change of close price over n days
  - Use the rate of change as a factor to measure the speed of price movement
    - High rate of change may indicate a rapid price movement
- Calculate the directional movement index (DMI) over n days
  - Use the DMI as a factor to assess the strength of price trend
    - High DMI may indicate a strong trend
- Calculate the average true range (ATR) over n days
  - Use the ATR as a factor to measure market volatility
    - High ATR may indicate increased future price volatility
- Calculate the commodity channel index (CCI) over n days
  - Use the CCI as a factor to identify overbought or oversold conditions
    - High CCI may indicate an overbought condition
- Calculate the accumulation/distribution line (ADL) over n days
  - Use the ADL as a factor to assess the flow of money into or out of the stock
    - Rising ADL may indicate buying pressure
- Calculate the Williams %R over n days
  - Use the Williams %R as a factor to identify overbought or oversold conditions
    - Low %R may indicate an oversold condition
- Calculate the stochastic oscillator
