Thought: Synthesize Price Patterns, Volume, and Amount for Enhanced Alpha Factor Generation
- Sub-thought: Analyze price action to identify trend and momentum factors
  - Sub-thought: Use the (high - low) value as a raw volatility factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate (close - open) / (high - low) as a raw price movement factor
  - Sub-thought: Simple Momentum for Close Prices
    - Close price (t)
    - Close price (t-1)
  - Sub-thought: Long-Term Trend Indicator
    - Calculate 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    - Calculate 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    - Subtract 50-Day SMA from 200-Day SMA
- Sub-thought: Examine volume changes to infer market sentiment
  - Sub-thought: Compute today's volume - yesterday's volume as a raw volume change factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate (volume * (close - open)) as a raw volume-price interaction factor
  - Sub-thought: Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength
    - Multiply Daily Range by Volume
    - Add Open-to-Close Movement
  - Sub-thought: Volume-Adjusted Momentum
    - Subtract previous Close from current Close
    - Multiply by Volume
- Sub-thought: Combine price and volume information to create more complex factors
  - Sub-thought: Summarize the (close - open) * volume over the last 5 days as a raw price-volume composite factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the (open - previous close) as a raw gap factor
  - Sub-thought: Spread Momentum
    - Moving Average of High-Low Price Spread
      - Use Last 20 Days High-Low Spreads
      - Calculate Average
    - Subtract Previous Day's Average from Current Day's Average
- Sub-thought: Incorporate the concept of money flow by analyzing the amount traded
  - Sub-thought: Define positive money flow as (close - open) * volume when close > open, otherwise 0
  - Sub-thought: Define total money flow as (close - open) * volume, regardless of price direction
  - Sub-thought: Use the ratio of positive to total money flow as a raw money flow index
- Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between price and amount
  - Sub-thought: Use the (amount / volume) as a raw transaction size factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate (close - open) * (amount / volume) as a raw price-amount interaction factor
- Sub-thought: Investigate the momentum of price and volume together
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the (close - open) * (volume / average volume) as a raw momentum factor
- Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between price, volume, and amount
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the (close - open) * (volume / average volume) * (amount / volume) as a raw price-volume-amount composite factor
  - Sub-thought: Open-High-Low Volatility
    - Open-High Price Difference
      - High price (t) - Open price (t)
    - Open-Low Price Difference
      - Open price (t) - Low price (t)
    - Weighted Average by Volume
      - Aggregate Differences
- Sub-thought: Enhanced Price Reversion
  - Calculate 10-Day High and Low Prices
    - Find the Highest High in 10 Days
    - Find the Lowest Low in 10 Days
  - Proximity to Range
    - Current Close to 10-Day High
    - Current Close to 10-Day Low
  - Combine Proximity Metrics
    - Take the Minimum Proximity
    - Invert the Value
  - Adjust for Volatility
    - 20-Day Standard Deviation of Daily Returns
    - Divide Inverted Proximity by Standard Deviation
- Sub-thought: Combined Indicators
  - Weighted Sum of Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength, Spread Momentum, and Volume-Adjusted Momentum
    - Multiply Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength by a weight
    - Add Spread Momentum
    - Add Volume-Adjusted Momentum
  - Incorporate Relative Strength
    - Calculate 20-Day Average Close Price
    - Divide Current Close Price by 20-Day Average
  - Final Alpha Factor
    - Combined Indicator * Enhanced Price Reversion * Open-High-Low Volatility * Long-Term Trend
- Sub-thought: Filter for Strong Moves
  - Check if Combined Indicator is above a Dynamic Threshold
  - Return 1 if True, 0 otherwise
