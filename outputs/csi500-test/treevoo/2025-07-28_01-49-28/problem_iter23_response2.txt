    This function generates a novel and interpretable alpha factor based on the given market data.
    The alpha factor is designed to predict future stock returns by leveraging the relationship between

    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame with (date) as index and columns ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'amount', 'volume'].

    Returns:
    pd.Series: A Series with (date) as index representing the alpha factor values.
