Performing alpha mining to generate novel and interpretable factors for predicting future stock returns
|-- Use price data (open, high, low, close) to create momentum-based factors
|   |-- Calculate the rate of change (ROC) using the close price
|   |   |-- ROC = (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
|   |-- Calculate the percentage price oscillator (PPO) using exponential moving averages (EMA)
|       |-- PPO = (EMA(Close, 12) - EMA(Close, 26)) / EMA(Close, 26)
|-- Use volume and amount data to create liquidity-based factors
|   |-- Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV) as a cumulative measure of buying and selling pressure
|   |   |-- If Close_t > Close_{t-1}, OBV_t = OBV_{t-1} + Volume_t
|   |   |-- If Close_t < Close_{t-1}, OBV_t = OBV_{t-1} - Volume_t
|   |   |-- If Close_t == Close_{t-1}, OBV_t = OBV_{t-1}
|   |-- Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) to understand the average price at which trades occur
|       |-- VWAP = (Cumulative(Volume * TypicalPrice)) / Cumulative(Volume)
|           |-- TypicalPrice = (High + Low + Close) / 3
|-- Combine price and volume factors to create integrated factors
    |-- Calculate a combined indicator that incorporates both momentum and liquidity
    |   |-- MomentumLiquidityFactor = ROC * OBV / VWAP
    |-- Incorporate directional movement in the context of volume and price
        |-- DirectionalMovementFactor = (Close_t - Open_t) * Volume_t
