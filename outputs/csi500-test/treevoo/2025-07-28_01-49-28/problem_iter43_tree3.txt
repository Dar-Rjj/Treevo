Thought: Explore Price Patterns and Volume for Alpha Factor Generation
- Sub-thought: Analyze price action to identify trend and momentum factors
  - Sub-thought: Use the (high - low) value as a raw volatility factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate (close - open) / (high - low) as a raw price movement factor
- Sub-thought: Examine volume changes to infer market sentiment
  - Sub-thought: Compute today's volume - yesterday's volume as a raw volume change factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate (volume * (close - open)) as a raw volume-price interaction factor
- Sub-thought: Combine price and volume information to create more complex factors
  - Sub-thought: Summarize the (close - open) * volume over the last 5 days as a raw price-volume composite factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the (open - previous close) as a raw gap factor
- Sub-thought: Incorporate the concept of money flow by analyzing the amount traded
  - Sub-thought: Define positive money flow as (close - open) * volume when close > open, otherwise 0
  - Sub-thought: Define total money flow as (close - open) * volume, regardless of price direction
  - Sub-thought: Use the ratio of positive to total money flow as a raw money flow index
- Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between price and amount
  - Sub-thought: Use the (amount / volume) as a raw transaction size factor
- Sub-thought: Investigate the momentum of price and volume together
