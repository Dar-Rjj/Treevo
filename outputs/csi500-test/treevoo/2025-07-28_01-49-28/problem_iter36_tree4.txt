Performing Alpha Mining
    - Generate Novel and Interpretable Alpha Factors
        - Calculate Daily Returns
            - (Close Price at t / Close Price at t-1) - 1
        - Calculate Intraday Volatility
            - |High Price - Low Price| / (High Price + Low Price)
        - Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
            - Sum of (Volume * Close Price) / Total Volume
        - Calculate Money Flow Index (MFI)
            - Typical Price = (High Price + Low Price + Close Price) / 3
            - Money Flow = Typical Price * Volume
            - Positive Money Flow = Sum of Money Flow for days when Typical Price > Previous Day's Typical Price
            - Negative Money Flow = Sum of Money Flow for days when Typical Price < Previous Day's Typical Price
            - MFI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Positive Money Flow / Negative Money Flow)))
        - Calculate Relative Strength Index (RSI)
            - Gain = Close Price at t - Close Price at t-1 if gain is positive, else 0
            - Loss = Close Price at t-1 - Close Price at t if loss is positive, else 0
            - Average Gain = Sum of Gains over n periods / n
            - Average Loss = Sum of Losses over n periods / n
            - RS = Average Gain / Average Loss
            - RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
        - Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
            - OBV at t = OBV at t-1 + Volume if Close Price at t > Close Price at t-1
            - OBV at t = OBV at t-1 - Volume if Close Price at t < Close Price at t-1
            - OBV at t = OBV at t-1 if Close Price at t = Close Price at t-1
        - Calculate Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)
            - A/D Line at t = A/D Line at t-1 + (Close Price - Low Price - (High Price - Close Price)) / (High Price - Low Price) * Volume
        - Calculate Price Volume Trend (PVT)
            - PVT at t = PVT at t-1 + (Close Price at t - Close Price at t-1) / Close Price at t-1 * Volume at t
        - Combine Factors
            - Create a composite score by summing up the normalized values of the above factors
                - Note: Normalization is not allowed, so use raw factor values
            - Use the composite score to predict future stock returns
