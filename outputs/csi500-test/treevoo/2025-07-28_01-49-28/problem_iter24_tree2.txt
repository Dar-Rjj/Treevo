Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength, Enhanced Momentum, and Price Reversion with Trend Following
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength
│   ├── Daily Range: High - Low
│   ├── Open-to-Close Movement: Close - Open
│   └── Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength: (Daily Range * Volume) + Open-to-Close Movement
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   └── Volume-Adjusted Momentum: (Close - Previous Close) * Volume
├── Calculate Enhanced Price Reversion
│   ├── 10-Day High: Max(High, last 10 days)
│   ├── 10-Day Low: Min(Low, last 10 days)
│   ├── Proximity to 10-Day High: 10-Day High - Current Close
│   ├── Proximity to 10-Day Low: Current Close - 10-Day Low
│   ├── Minimum Proximity: Min(Proximity to 10-Day High, Proximity to 10-Day Low)
│   ├── Inverted Proximity: 1 / Minimum Proximity
│   └── Adjusted Reversion: Inverted Proximity / 20-Day Standard Deviation of Daily Returns
├── Integrate Open-High-Low Volatility
│   ├── Open-High Difference: High - Open
│   ├── Open-Low Difference: Open - Low
│   └── Weighted Average by Volume: (Open-High Difference + Open-Low Difference) / 2 * Volume
├── Introduce Trend Following Component
│   ├── 50-Day Moving Average: MA(Close, 50)
│   ├── 200-Day Moving Average: MA(Close, 200)
│   └── Trend Score: (50-Day Moving Average - 200-Day Moving Average) / 200-Day Moving Average
├── Final Alpha Factor
    └── Final Alpha Factor: Volume-Adjusted Breakout Strength * Volume-Adjusted Momentum * Enhanced Price Reversion * Open-High-Low Volatility * Trend Score
