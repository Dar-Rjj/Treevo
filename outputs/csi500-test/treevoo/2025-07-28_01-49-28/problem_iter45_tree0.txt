    - Sub-thought: High minus Low
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Open-Close Spread
    - Sub-thought: Close minus Open
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Day-over-Day Returns
    - Sub-thought: Close(t) - Close(t-1)
  - Sub-thought: Identify Reversal Patterns
    - Sub-thought: Detect Bearish Engulfing (High(t) > High(t-1) and Low(t) < Low(t-1) and Close(t) < Open(t) and Close(t-1) > Open(t-1))
    - Sub-thought: Detect Bullish Engulfing (Low(t) < Low(t-1) and High(t) > High(t-1) and Close(t) > Open(t) and Close(t-1) < Open(t-1))

Thought: Volume and Price Interaction
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Sub-thought: Sum(Close * Volume) / Sum(Volume) over a period
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Change
    - Sub-thought: Volume(t) - Volume(t-1)
  - Sub-thought: Detect Volume Spikes
    - Sub-thought: Volume(t) > 2 * Average(Volume, n) where n is a lookback period

Thought: Trend and Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    - Sub-thought: SMA(Close, n) where n is a lookback period
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    - Sub-thought: EMA(Close, n) where n is a lookback period
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Momentum
    - Sub-thought: Close(t) - Close(t-n) where n is a lookback period
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Sub-thought: (Close(t) - Close(t-n)) / Close(t-n) * 100 where n is a lookback period

Thought: Market Sentiment Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL)
    - Sub-thought: ADL = Previous ADL + (Close - Low - (High - Close)) / (High - Low) * Volume
  - Sub-thought: Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Sub-thought: OBV = OBV(t-1) + If(Close(t) > Close(t-1), Volume, If(Close(t) < Close(t-1), -Volume, 0))
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Sub-thought: CMF = Sum((Close - Low - (High - Close)) / (High - Low) * Volume, n) / Sum(Volume, n) where n is a lookback period
