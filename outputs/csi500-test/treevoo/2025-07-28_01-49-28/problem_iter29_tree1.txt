Thought: Synthesize Price Patterns, Volume, and Momentum for Alpha Factor Generation
- Sub-thought: Analyze price action to identify trend and momentum factors
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between high and low prices as a measure of volatility
    - Sub-thought: Use the (high - low) value as a raw volatility factor
    - Sub-thought: Determine the 20-day moving average of the daily price range (High - Low)
  - Sub-thought: Determine the strength of the closing price relative to the opening, high, and low prices
    - Sub-thought: Calculate (close - open) / (high - low) as a raw price movement factor
    - Sub-thought: Compute the relationship between Open and Close prices; (Close - Open) / Open
- Sub-thought: Examine volume changes to infer market sentiment
  - Sub-thought: Look at the change in volume from one day to the next
    - Sub-thought: Compute today's volume - yesterday's volume as a raw volume change factor
    - Sub-thought: Analyze the 10-day cumulative volume delta (difference between up-volume and down-volume)
  - Sub-thought: Assess the relationship between volume and price
    - Sub-thought: Calculate (volume * (close - open)) as a raw volume-price interaction factor
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the 20-day moving average of volume
- Sub-thought: Combine price and volume information to create more complex factors
  - Sub-thought: Consider the combined effect of price and volume over a short period
    - Sub-thought: Summarize the (close - open) * volume over the last 5 days as a raw price-volume composite factor
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices
    - Sub-thought: Compute the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices
  - Sub-thought: Investigate the impact of price gaps on stock returns
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the (open - previous close) as a raw gap factor
- Sub-thought: Incorporate the concept of money flow by analyzing the amount traded
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of positive money flow to total money flow
    - Sub-thought: Define positive money flow as (close - open) * volume when close > open, otherwise 0
    - Sub-thought: Define total money flow as (close - open) * volume, regardless of price direction
    - Sub-thought: Use the ratio of positive to total money flow as a raw money flow index
- Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between price and amount
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the (amount / volume) to find the average transaction size
    - Sub-thought: Use the (amount / volume) as a raw transaction size factor
- Sub-thought: Investigate the momentum of price and volume together
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the (close - open) * (volume / average volume) as a raw momentum factor
  - Sub-thought: Compute the average volume over a certain period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing prices over a 20-day period
  - Sub-thought: Compute the 10-day rate of change (ROC) of closing prices
- Sub-thought: Explore volatility measures as potential alpha factors
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the standard deviation of log-returns over a 30-day window
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) based on the close prices
