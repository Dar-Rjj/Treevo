Use rolling mean for smoothing, incorporate momentum and volatility, consider market sentiment, and test with different window sizes.
Simplify smoothing, focus on core price and volume dynamics, and consider relative strength measures.
Consider shorter rolling windows and incorporate momentum or volatility measures for enhanced predictive power.
Simplify calculations, use rolling mean for smoothing, and focus on volume and amount-weighted price differences.
Shorten smoothing windows, reduce complexity, and normalize by price range for more responsive and interpretable factors.
Use shorter rolling windows, consider additional price/volume ratios, and explore more smoothing techniques.
Simplify and focus on volatility and volume, omit RSI for clearer signals.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and liquidity measures; use adaptive smoothing; consider inter-feature correlations.
Consider trend and momentum, use longer smoothing windows, and incorporate price change ratios.
Consider shorter smoothing windows, incorporate typical price, and combine multiple weighted metrics for robustness.
