Simplify, focus on key price and volume metrics, avoid over-smoothing, and limit the number of combined factors.
Reduce smoothing, balance components, and consider incorporating volatility and transaction patterns.
Consider shorter smoothing windows and incorporate more dynamic price/volume relationships.
Incorporate momentum, use rolling means for smoothing, and weight components by their predictive power.
Consider trend, momentum, and volatility. Use longer smoothing windows and incorporate more historical data for stability.
Consider shorter smoothing windows and direct use of ratios for more responsive and interpretable factors.
Reduce EWM span for quicker reaction; consider additional features like momentum or volatility.
Reduce over-smoothing, maintain dynamic market signals, and balance between volume and amount-weighted measures.
Reduce smoothing, focus on immediate data, and explore more price and volume ratios.
Consider longer smoothing windows, incorporate momentum, and explore additional price and volume ratios for more robust factors.
