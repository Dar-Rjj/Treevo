Consider shorter smoothing, incorporate longer-term trends, and refine ratios for better predictive power.
Incorporate more price/volume ratios, adjust moving average windows, and consider long-term trends for better heuristics.
Shorten rolling windows, refine RSI calculation, and consider more dynamic price/volume interactions.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use normalized factors, and consider interaction terms for improved heuristics.
Reduce smoothing window, incorporate momentum, volatility, and multiple SMAs for improved factor.
Adjust smoothing windows, incorporate longer-term trends, and refine price/volume ratios for enhanced predictive power.
Shorten smoothing windows, balance feature weights, and incorporate momentum and volatility for improved factor performance.
Shorter smoothing windows, include momentum, volatility, and longer-term moving averages for enhanced factor robustness.
Incorporate shorter smoothing, momentum, volatility, and trend factors for more responsive and robust alpha signals.
Focus on meaningful, less noisy components; simplify and avoid overcomplicating the alpha factor.
