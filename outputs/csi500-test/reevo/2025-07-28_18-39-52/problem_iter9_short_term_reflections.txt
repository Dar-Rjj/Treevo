Reduce smoothing span, use exponential mean for RSI, and combine factors more effectively.
Shorten smoothing windows, simplify calculations, and focus on key price and volume dynamics.
Incorporate RSI, volatility, and smoothed weighted differences; adjust for price range and normalize.
Consider shorter smoothing windows, include typical price, and simplify factor combinations for better responsiveness and interpretability.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and liquidity measures. Use longer smoothing spans for trend identification.
Consider shorter smoothing windows, incorporate typical price, and simplify factor combinations for better performance.
Use exponential smoothing for all moving averages and consider additional price/volume features.
Shorter smoothing windows and simpler factor combinations can improve responsiveness and reduce overfitting.
Simplify, avoid over-smoothing, and focus on meaningful weighted averages. Remove redundant elements like smoothed return.
Incorporate directional trends, optimize smoothing periods, and integrate broader market indicators for enhanced factor robustness.
