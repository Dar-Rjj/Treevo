Use shorter smoothing windows and include momentum indicators like RSI for enhanced factor performance.
Incorporate more technical indicators, smooth data, and consider multiple time frames for robustness.
Incorporate diverse ratios, longer-term moving averages, and refined momentum for improved alpha factor robustness.
Incorporate more trend and momentum factors, use shorter smoothing windows, and add RSI for overbought/oversold signals.
Consider shorter smoothing windows, relevant price/volume ratios, and avoid overcomplicating with too many indicators.
Reduce smoothing, add RSI, focus on shorter-term trends, and balance components.
Shorten smoothing windows, incorporate negative volatility, and refine momentum for improved factor responsiveness and predictive power.
Balance feature contributions, use shorter smoothing windows, and integrate more price-derived and volume-derived ratios.
Reduce complexity, avoid overfitting, focus on key indicators, and consider market microstructure.
Shorter smoothing windows, multiple moving averages, and shorter momentum and volatility periods enhance factor responsiveness.
