Incorporate multiple timeframes, use normalized indicators, and balance components for robustness.
Incorporate more periods, use dynamic weights, and integrate volume trends for improved alpha factor robustness.
Incorporate longer-term trends, adjust for volatility, and use weighted price differences for more robust factors.
Incorporate more diverse metrics, use adaptive windows, and consider macroeconomic indicators.
Incorporate adaptive windows, combine multiple timeframes, and use risk-adjusted returns for more robust alpha factors.
Integrate macro trends, sentiment, and technicals. Use machine learning for feature selection and non-linear relationships.
Incorporate adaptive weights, consider liquidity, and include mean reversion signals for enhanced alpha generation.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use risk-adjusted returns, and combine multiple time frames for robustness.
Integrate more diverse metrics, use adaptive windows, and consider market regime changes.
Incorporate more diverse time frames, risk-adjusted returns, and volume trends for enhanced factor robustness.
