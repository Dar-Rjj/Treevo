```python

    volatility_adjusted_by_volume = (df['high'] - df['low']) / (df['volume'] + 1e-7)
    
    # Calculate the price change from open to close
    price_change = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate the weighted price change by normalizing it with the adjusted volatility
    weighted_price_change = price_change / (volatility_adjusted_by_volume + 1e-7)
