Consider liquidity, market sentiment, and economic indicators for more robust alpha factors.
Simplify factors, focus on key indicators, and use adaptive weights for dynamic market conditions.
Integrate liquidity, use dynamic thresholds, and consider macroeconomic indicators for enhanced factor performance.
Incorporate liquidity, trading signals, and advanced statistical measures for improved factor robustness.
Incorporate mean reversion, use adaptive weights, and consider additional market microstructure features for robustness.
Integrate mean reversion selectively, optimize adaptive weights, and consider liquidity and market regime changes.
Simplify, focus on key factors, and avoid overfitting by reducing the number of combined signals.
Integrate mean reversion and adaptive weights; explore additional market microstructure signals for enhancement.
Simplify and focus on key factors; avoid overcomplicating with too many components.
Integrate dynamic volatility and refine mean reversion for improved factor robustness.
