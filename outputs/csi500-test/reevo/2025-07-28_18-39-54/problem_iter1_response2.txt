```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the close and open prices, representing the price change over the day
    price_change = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate the average transaction amount per unit of volume to find the average transaction size
    avg_transaction_size = df['amount'] / (df['volume'] + 1e-7)
    
    # A factor that combines the price change with the average transaction size to identify strong price movements
    # backed by significant trading activity, which could indicate a potential trend continuation.
    alpha_factor = price_change * avg_transaction_size
    
    return alpha_factor
```
