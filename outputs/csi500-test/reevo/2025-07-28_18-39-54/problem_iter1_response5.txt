```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the close and the open prices as a measure of intraday momentum
    intraday_momentum = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate the weighted average price using amount and volume, this acts as a different way to value the closing price
    weighted_price = (df['amount'] * df['close']) / df['volume']
    
    # Calculate the deviation of the current close price from the 5-day moving average close price
    moving_avg_5 = df['close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    dev_from_ma5 = df['close'] - moving_avg_5
    
    # Combine all the factors into a final score
    factor_value = intraday_momentum + (weighted_price * 0.5) + dev_from_ma5
