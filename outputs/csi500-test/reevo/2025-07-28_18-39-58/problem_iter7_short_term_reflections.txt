Simplify and focus on key signals; avoid over-smoothing to retain predictive edge.
Simplify, avoid over-complexity, handle missing values, and focus on key factors like momentum and volume.
Incorporate multi-period trends, adaptive weights, and volatility normalization for more robust alpha factor generation.
Incorporate shorter windows, combine short and long-term trends, and adjust for liquidity to enhance predictive power.
Incorporate multi-period trends, volatility, and adaptive weights for more robust factor signals.
Incorporate multi-timeframe analysis, adaptive weights, and combine short-term and long-term factors for robustness.
Smooth short and long-term momentum, use volume anomalies, normalize by true range and volatility.
Incorporate liquidity, use longer smoothing, and adjust for both volatility and true range.
Incorporate longer moving averages, adaptive weighting, and normalize with true range and volatility for improved factor robustness.
Simplify and avoid over-smoothing; consider incorporating more diverse indicators and their interactions.
