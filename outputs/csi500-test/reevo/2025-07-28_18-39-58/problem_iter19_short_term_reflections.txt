Refine adaptive weights, incorporate microstructure, and normalize by sector-specific volatility for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Simplify, focus on key factors, avoid overcomplication, and ensure factors are interpretable and grounded in financial theory.
Incorporate market microstructure, adjust for volatility, and fine-tune adaptive weights for momentum.
Incorporate volume and true range ratio, and refine momentum and volatility adjustments for better predictive power.
Incorporate market microstructure and sentiment; adjust for volatility and liquidity more dynamically.
Incorporate sector-specific factors, price consistency, and high-low ratios for improved predictive power.
Incorporate high-low price ratios, and refine adaptive weights for momentum. Consider sector-specific volatility.
Incorporate sector-specific factors, price consistency, and high-low price ratios for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate more dynamic sector factors, refine volatility adjustments, and enhance momentum calculations.
