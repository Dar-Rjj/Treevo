Combine multiple timeframes, use normalized indicators, and consider both momentum and volatility for robust factors.
Incorporate adaptive weights, volatility, and true range for more dynamic and normalized alpha factor.
Incorporate longer-term trends, normalize by volatility, and use moving averages for smoother indicators.
Incorporate multi-period analysis, smooth out noise, and normalize with liquidity metrics for more robust factors.
Incorporate volatility, use adaptive weighting, and consider longer-term trends for more robust alpha factors.
Consider shorter momentum, adaptive volatility, and integrating liquidity measures for enhanced factor performance.
Integrate multi-period analysis, smooth volatility, and detect anomalies for robust alpha factor generation.
Consider volatility, liquidity, and trend strength. Normalize to reduce noise and enhance signal clarity.
Incorporate longer-term trends, volume anomalies, and normalize by volatility and true range for robust factor generation.
Consider longer-term trends, weight momentum terms differently, and explore alternative normalization methods.
