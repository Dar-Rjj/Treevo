```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the close and open price, then scale it by the daily volume
    price_diff_scaled_by_volume = (df['close'] - df['open']) * df['volume']
    
    # Calculate a simple moving average of the scaled price difference over 10 days
    sma_10_day_price_diff_scaled = price_diff_scaled_by_volume.rolling(window=10).mean()
    
    return sma_10_day_price_diff_scaled
