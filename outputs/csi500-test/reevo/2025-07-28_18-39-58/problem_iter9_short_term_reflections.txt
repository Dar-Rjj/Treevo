Integrate adaptive weighting, consider various time frames, and normalize by volatility and true range.
Incorporate multiple time frames, use logarithmic returns, and consider market microstructure effects for improved heuristics.
Incorporate multiple time frames, normalize by volatility, and adjust for liquidity using a relevant moving average.
Incorporate liquidity, use shorter-term trends, and balance momentum with volatility and volume anomalies.
Simplify factors, focus on key trends, and use meaningful volatility adjustments for clearer signals.
Incorporate adaptive weights, multiple timeframes, and normalize by true range and volatility for robustness.
Incorporate more trend signals, use true range for normalization, and consider longer-term momentum for stability.
Incorporate adaptive weighting, normalize by true range and volatility, and use combined momentum for robustness.
Incorporate short-term trends, use true range for normalization, and consider volume anomalies for more robust factor generation.
Simplify factors, focus on key trends, and normalize effectively. Consider sector-specific indicators and machine learning for dynamic weighting.
