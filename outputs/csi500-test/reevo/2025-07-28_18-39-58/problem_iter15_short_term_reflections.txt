Consider log returns, adaptive weights, and incorporate both trend and market microstructure for robust factor generation.
Incorporate more market microstructure, sentiment, and sector-specific factors; refine volatility and momentum weightings.
Use logarithmic returns, adaptive weights, and balance short-term and long-term volatility for stability and better trend capturing.
Incorporate weighted moving averages, use relative strength, and normalize with ATR for improved stability and trend capture.
Use log returns, adaptive weights, and combine multiple time frames for momentum and trend. Normalize by true range and volatility.
Incorporate more varied momentum terms, use adaptive weights, and adjust for both short and long-term volatility.
Incorporate liquidity, use absolute momentum, and balance short-term and long-term volatility for improved factor stability.
Incorporate more nuanced volatility measures and adaptive weighting, consider liquidity and market microstructure effects.
Incorporate more diverse momentum terms, use adaptive weights, and adjust for both short- and long-term volatility.
Incorporate market microstructure, adjust for average volatility, and refine adaptive weights for better performance.
