```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close, capturing the momentum
    momentum = df['close'].diff()
    
    # Calculate the percentage change in volume from the previous day to detect unusual trading activity
    volume_change = df['volume'].pct_change().fillna(0)
    
    # Calculate a weighted sum of price and volume changes to capture significant market movements
    factor = 0.8 * momentum + 0.2 * (volume_change * df['amount'])
    
    return factor
```
