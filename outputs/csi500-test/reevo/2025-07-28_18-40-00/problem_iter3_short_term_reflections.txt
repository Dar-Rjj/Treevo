Incorporate momentum, volatility, and liquidity metrics; simplify calculations; use relative, not absolute, measures.
Incorporate volatility, trading volume patterns, and advanced technical indicators for richer, more predictive alpha factors.
Incorporate more price and volume features, use rolling statistics, and adjust for volatility.
Incorporate price and volume volatility, use normalized ratios, and consider multi-day momentum for improved factor robustness.
Incorporate more price levels, use volume-adjusted metrics, and consider longer-term trends for smoother factors.
Incorporate longer trends, use volume-weighted prices, and consider market sentiment for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate trend, momentum, and volume indicators; use rolling windows and weighted combinations for robustness.
Consider trend, volatility, and liquidity. Combine price changes with volume trends for more predictive power.
Incorporate multi-period momentum, liquidity, and trend indicators; optimize weights through backtesting.
Incorporate volatility, leverage more pricing data, and refine volume normalization for enhanced predictive power.
