```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the close and open prices, then scale it by the average of high and low
    price_diff = (df['close'] - df['open']) / ((df['high'] + df['low']) / 2 + 1e-7)
    # Calculate the volume-weighted ratio of the amount
    volume_weighted_amount = df['amount'] / df['volume']
    # Combine the two factors to create a new alpha factor
    alpha_factor = price_diff * volume_weighted_amount
    return alpha_factor
```
