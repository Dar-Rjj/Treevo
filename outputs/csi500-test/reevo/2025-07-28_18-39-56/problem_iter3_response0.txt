```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
    vwap = (df['amount'] / df['volume']).cumsum() / df['volume'].cumsum()
    
    # Calculate the exponential moving average of the VWAP with a window of 7 days
    ema_vwap = vwap.ewm(span=7, adjust=False).mean()
    
    # Calculate the logarithmic returns for the close price
    log_returns = np.log(df['close'] / df['close'].shift(1))
    
    # Calculate the momentum of the close price with a window of 5 days
    momentum = df['close'].pct_change(periods=5)
    
    # Calculate the factor as the difference between the close price and the EMA of VWAP
    # multiply it by the momentum to incorporate the trend and then by the log returns to add sentiment
    factor = (df['close'] - ema_vwap) * momentum * log_returns
