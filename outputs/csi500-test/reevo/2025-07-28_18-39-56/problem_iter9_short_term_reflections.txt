Consider momentum, volatility, and liquidity. Use EMA for trend, RSI for sentiment, and log returns for smoothing.
Incorporate more nuanced market signals, like order book imbalances, and use machine learning for adaptive factor weights.
Integrate more market dynamics, use adaptive windows, and combine with technical indicators for robustness.
Focus on reducing complexity, maintaining meaningful signals, and normalizing factors for better interpretability.
Incorporate adaptive windows, use VWAP, log returns, and integrate volatility for more robust and dynamic alpha factors.
Incorporate more dynamic and less correlated indicators, and consider using machine learning for factor synthesis.
Incorporate more dynamic and responsive indicators, balance between trend, momentum, and volatility.
Incorporate more refined volume and price dynamics, and consider market sentiment and liquidity measures.
Integrate macroeconomic indicators, use machine learning for factor synthesis, and incorporate sector-specific metrics.
Combine momentum, volatility, and volume indicators; smooth data to reduce noise; use ratios for normalization.
