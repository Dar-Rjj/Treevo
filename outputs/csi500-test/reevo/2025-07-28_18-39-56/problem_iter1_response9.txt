```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between close and open, high and low, then use their ratio
    # This factor might capture the overall directional movement of the stock within a day
    # as well as the relative volatility (high-low range) adjusted by the daily price change (close-open).
    daily_movement = df['close'] - df['open']
    daily_volatility = df['high'] - df['low'] + 1e-7  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero
    factor = (daily_movement / daily_volatility) * (df['volume'] / df['amount'])
    return factor
```
