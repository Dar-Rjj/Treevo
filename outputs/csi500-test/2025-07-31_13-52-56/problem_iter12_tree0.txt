Integrated High-Low Range, Volume Dynamics, and Momentum Synthesis for Enhanced Alpha Factor
├── Calculate High-Low Range and Its Volume-Adjusted Version
│   ├── Compute High-Low Range: High - Low
│   └── Compute Volume Adjusted High-Low Range: (High - Low) * Volume
├── Evaluate Cumulative and Dynamic High-Low Measures
│   ├── Calculate Cumulative High-Low Range: Sum of Volume Adjusted High-Low Range over N days
│   └── Calculate High-to-Low Price Ratio: High / Low
├── Analyze Volume Trends and Momentum
│   ├── Compute Volume Moving Average: Use Volume with a 10-day window
│   ├── Determine Volume Trend: +1 if Current Volume > Moving Average, -1 otherwise
│   ├── Measure Volume Momentum: Change in Aggregated Volume (Sum of past n days' volume)
│       ├── Aggregated Volume at t-1
│       └── Aggregated Volume at t-n
├── Integrate Open-Close Momentum with Volatility Indicators
│   ├── Calculate Open-to-Close Price Change: Close - Open
│   ├── Calculate Cumulative Open-to-Close Price Change: Sum of Open-to-Close Price Change over N days
│   └── Compute Average True Range: Average of (High - Low) over past n days
├── Synthesize Components into Alpha Factor
│   ├── Combine Volume Trend with High-Low Price Ratio: (High / Low) * Volume Trend
│   ├── Incorporate Volume Momentum and Adjusted High-Low Range: (High - Low) * Volume * Volume Momentum
│   └── Include Momentum and Range Expansion: (High - Low) * (Aggregated Volume at t-1 - Aggregated Volume at t-n)
│   └── Integrate Open-Close Momentum with Volume-Adjusted High-Low Range: (Close - Open) * (High - Low) * Volume
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Use the Integrated Component from Synthesize Step
    └── Ensure Interpretation
        ├── Positive Values: Strong High-Low ratio, increasing volume, and positive momentum
        └── Negative Values: Weak High-Low ratio, decreasing volume, and negative momentum
