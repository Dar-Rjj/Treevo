Crossover and Integration of Price, Volume, and Momentum for Novel Alpha Factors
├── Calculate Adjusted High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
│   └── Multiply by sqrt(Volume)
├── Evaluate Volume Trend
│   ├── Compare Current Volume to 10-day Moving Average
│       ├── Assign +1 for Increasing
│       └── Assign -1 for Decreasing
├── Integrate Volume Trend with Adjusted Range
│   ├── Multiply Adjusted High-to-Low Range by Volume Trend (+1/-1)
├── Calculate Momentum Signal
│   ├── Compute 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close price
├── Combine Adjusted Range and Momentum
│   ├── Subtract Momentum Signal from Integrated Adjusted High-to-Low Range
├── Calculate Relative Strength
│   ├── Compute the ratio of Close price to the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close price
└── Incorporate Relative Strength into Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply the Combined Alpha Factor by the Relative Strength
