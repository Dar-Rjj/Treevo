Crossover and Integration of Enhanced High-Low Price, Volume, Momentum for Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Enhanced High-to-Low Price Ratio
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Evaluate Volume Trend
│   ├── Compute 10-day Volume Moving Average
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Compare Current Volume to 10-day Moving Average
│       ├── Assign +1 for Increasing
│       └── Assign -1 for Decreasing
├── Integrate Components for Adjusted High-to-Low Price Ratio
│   ├── Multiply High-to-Low Price Ratio by Volume Trend (+1/-1)
│   └── Ensure Interpretation
│       ├── Positive Values: High-to-Low ratio is high, and volume is increasing
│       └── Negative Values: High-to-Low ratio is low, and volume is decreasing
├── Calculate 30-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract close price of day t-30 from close price of day t
│   └── Divide the result by the close price of day t-30
├── Identify Volume Shock
│   ├── Compare day t volume with 30-day average volume (excluding day t)
│   └── Assign value: 1 if day t volume > 2 * 30-day average, else 0
├── Multiply 30-day Momentum by Volume Shock indicator
│   └── A high positive or negative value indicates a strong price momentum 
│       accompanied by a significant volume surge, potentially signaling a 
│       continuation trend.
├── Calculate Adjusted High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   ├── Use Low price
│   │   └── Subtract Low from High
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply High-to-Low Range by sqrt(Volume)
├── Detect Volume Spike
│   ├── Compute 5-day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   ├── Take the average of the last 5 days' volumes
│   └── Determine if Current Volume is a Spike
│       ├── Compare current volume to 5-day moving average
│       └── If current volume > 1.7 * 5-day moving average, set spike flag to 1, else 0
├── Calculate 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close price
│   └── Calculate EMA using a smoothing factor of 2 / (10 + 1)
├── Combine Adjusted High-to-Low Range, 10-day Momentum, and Volume Spike
│   ├── Add 10-day Momentum Signal to Adjusted High-to-Low Range
│   └── Multiply by Volume Spike Flag
│       ├── If spike flag is 1, factor value is multiplied by 2.5, else remains unchanged
├── Synthesize Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Add the results from the 30-day Momentum and Volume Shock
    ├── Add the results from the Combined Adjusted Range, 10-day Momentum, and Volume Spike
    └── Subtract 10-day EMA of Close price from the combined result
        └── The final alpha factor combines both short-term and long-term momentum signals
            with volume shock and spike adjustments, and subtracts the 10-day EMA of the close
            price, providing a more robust signal for predicting future stock returns.
