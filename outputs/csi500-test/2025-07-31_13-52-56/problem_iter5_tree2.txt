Synthesis of High-Low Range, Open-Close Momentum, and Volume Shock for Alpha Prediction
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High to get Range
├── Compute Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply by High-Low Range
├── Calculate Cumulative High-Low Range
│   └── Sum Volume Adjusted High-Low Range over N days
├── Calculate Open-to-Close Price Change
│   ├── Use Open price
│   └── Use Close price
│       └── Subtract Open from Close to get Change
├── Calculate Cumulative Open-to-Close Price Change
│   └── Sum Open-to-Close Price Change over N days
├── Calculate 30-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract close price of day t-30 from close price of day t
│   └── Divide the result by the close price of day t-30
├── Identify Volume Shock
│   ├── Compare day t volume with 30-day average volume (excluding day t)
│   └── Assign value: 1 if day t volume > 2 * 30-day average, else 0
├── Combine Momentum and Volume Shock
│   └── Multiply the 30-day Momentum by the Volume Shock indicator
├── Final Combined Alpha Factor
│   ├── Use High-Low Range Momentum
│   │   └── Divide Cumulative High-Low Range by Cumulative Open-to-Close Price Change
│   ├── Incorporate Momentum and Volume Shock
│   │   └── Multiply combined factor by the final combined momentum and volume shock
│   └── Adjust for Recent Volume Impact
│       └── Multiply by the difference between latest and earliest Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
└── Interpretation: The final alpha factor integrates high-low range momentum, open-close price change momentum, and a significant volume event, providing an enhanced signal for predicting future stock returns.
