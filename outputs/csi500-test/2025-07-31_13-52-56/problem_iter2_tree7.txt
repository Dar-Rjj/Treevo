    ├── Calculate Momentum
    │   ├── Use Cumulative High-Low Range over N periods
    │   │   └── Store the range in each period
    │   └── Calculate the difference between latest and earliest cumulative range
    │       └── Subtract the first cumulative range in the window from the last
    ├── Calculate Open-to-Close Price Change
    │   ├── Use Open price
