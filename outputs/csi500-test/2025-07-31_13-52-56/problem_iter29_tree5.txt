Crossover Enhanced High-Low Price and Volume Dynamics with Momentum and Relative Strength
├── Calculate Enhanced High-to-Low Price Ratio
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Evaluate Volume Trend
│   ├── Compute 10-day Volume Moving Average
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Compare Current Volume to 10-day Moving Average
│       ├── Assign +1 for Increasing
│       └── Assign -1 for Decreasing
├── Integrate Components for Adjusted High-to-Low Price Ratio
│   ├── Multiply High-to-Low Price Ratio by Volume Trend (+1/-1)
│   └── Ensure Interpretation
│       ├── Positive Values: High-to-Low ratio is high, and volume is increasing
│       └── Negative Values: High-to-Low ratio is low, and volume is decreasing
├── Adjust for Volume
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply High-to-Low Range by sqrt(Volume)
├── Calculate 30-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract close price of day t-30 from close price of day t
│   └── Divide the result by the close price of day t-30
├── Identify Volume Shock
│   ├── Compare day t volume with 30-day average volume (excluding day t)
│   └── Assign value: 1 if day t volume > 2 * 30-day average, else 0
├── Combine 30-day Momentum and Volume Shock
│   ├── Multiply 30-day Momentum by Volume Shock indicator
│   └── A high positive or negative value indicates a strong price momentum 
│       accompanied by a significant volume surge, potentially signaling a 
│       continuation trend.
├── Detect Volume Spike
│   ├── Compute 5-day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   ├── Take the average of the last 5 days' volumes
│   └── Determine if Current Volume is a Spike
│       ├── Compare current volume to 5-day moving average
│       └── If current volume > 1.7 * 5-day moving average, set spike flag to 1, else 0
├── Combine Adjusted High-to-Low Range, 30-day Momentum, and Volume Spike
│   ├── Add 30-day Momentum Signal to Adjusted High-to-Low Price Ratio
│   └── Multiply by Volume Spike Flag
│       ├── If spike flag is 1, factor value is multiplied by 2.5, else remains unchanged
├── Calculate 10-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Take the difference between Close price of day t and day t-10
├── Integrate 10-day Momentum into Combined Signal
│   ├── Add 10-day Momentum to the Combined Signal
│   └── Enhance short-term price movement signal
├── Calculate 5-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Take the difference between Close price of day t and day t-5
├── Integrate 5-day Momentum into Combined Signal
│   ├── Add 5-day Momentum to the Combined Signal
│   └── Enhance short-term price movement signal
├── Calculate Relative Strength
│   ├── Compute the ratio of Close price to the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close price
└── Incorporate Relative Strength into Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply the Combined Alpha Factor by the Relative Strength
    └── Interpretation
        ├── Positive Values: Strong High-Low ratio, increasing volume, positive momentum, and high relative strength
        └── Negative Values: Weak High-Low ratio, decreasing volume, negative momentum, and low relative strength
