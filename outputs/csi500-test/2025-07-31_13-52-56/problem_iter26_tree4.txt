Crossover and Integration of High-Low Price, Volume, Momentum, Intraday Dynamics, and Shock Factors for Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Enhanced Intraday Return
│   └── (Close price - Open price) / Open price
├── Evaluate Intraday Volatility
│   └── (High price - Low price)
├── Adjust Intraday Return with Intraday Volatility
│   └── (Intraday Return / Intraday Volatility)
├── Compute Enhanced High-to-Low Range
│   └── (High price - Low price)
├── Adjust for Volume
│   └── (High-to-Low Range * sqrt(Volume))
├── Evaluate Volume Trend
│   ├── 10-day Moving Average of Volume
│   └── Compare Current Volume to Moving Average
│       └── (+1 for Increasing, -1 for Decreasing)
├── Integrate Volume Trend with Adjusted Range
│   └── (Adjusted High-to-Low Range * Volume Trend)
├── Calculate 30-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract close price of day t-30 from close price of day t
│   └── Divide the result by the close price of day t-30
├── Identify Volume Shock
│   └── (Day t volume > 2 * 30-day average volume) ? 1 : 0
├── Combine 30-day Momentum and Volume Shock
│   └── (30-day Momentum * Volume Shock)
├── Calculate 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close price
│   └── EMA using a smoothing factor of 2 / (11)
├── Combine Adjusted Range, 10-day EMA, and Volume Trend
│   └── (Integrated Adjusted High-to-Low Range - 10-day EMA)
├── Detect Volume Spike
│   ├── Compute 5-day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   ├── Take the average of the last 5 days' volumes
│   └── Determine if Current Volume is a Spike
│       ├── Compare current volume to 5-day moving average
│       └── If current volume > 1.7 * 5-day moving average, set spike flag to 1, else 0
├── Calculate 10-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Take the difference between Close price of day t and day t-10
├── Combine Adjusted High-to-Low Range, 10-day Momentum, and Volume Spike
│   ├── Add 10-day Momentum Signal to Adjusted High-to-Low Price Ratio
│   └── Multiply by Volume Spike Flag
│       ├── If spike flag is 1, factor value is multiplied by 2.5, else remains unchanged
├── Calculate 5-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Take the difference between Close price of day t and day t-5
├── Integrate 5-day Momentum into Combined Signal
│   ├── Add 5-day Momentum to the Combined Signal
│   └── Enhance short-term price movement signal
└── Synthesize Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Add the results from the 30-day Momentum and Volume Shock
    └── Add the results from the Combined Adjusted Range, 10-day Momentum, and Volume Spike
        └── The final alpha factor combines both short-term and long-term momentum signals
            with volume shock and spike adjustments, providing a more robust signal for
            predicting future stock returns.
