Integrated High-Low Range and Open-Close Momentum with Volume Shock
├── Calculate 20-Day Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close prices
│   │   ├── Get the close price of day t
│   │   └── Get the close price of day t-20
│   └── Compute the 20-day Momentum
│       ├── Subtract close price of day t-20 from close price of day t
│       └── Divide the result by the close price of day t-20
├── Identify Volume Shock
│   ├── Use Volume data
│   │   ├── Get the volume of day t
│   │   └── Get the average volume of the last 20 days (excluding day t)
│   └── Determine if a shock occurred
│       ├── Compare day t volume with 20-day average volume
│       └── Assign value: 1 if day t volume > 2 * 20-day average, else 0
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High to get Range
├── Compute Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply by High-Low Range
├── Calculate Cumulative High-Low Range
│   └── Sum Volume Adjusted High-Low Range over N days
├── Calculate Open-to-Close Price Change
│   ├── Use Open price
│   └── Use Close price
│       └── Subtract Open from Close to get Change
├── Calculate Cumulative Open-to-Close Price Change
│   └── Sum Open-to-Close Price Change over N days
├── Calculate High-Low Range Momentum
│   ├── Use Cumulative High-Low Range
│   └── Divide by Cumulative Open-to-Close Price Change
│       └── Result is the High-Low Range Momentum
├── Calculate Difference in Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
│   ├── Use latest Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
│   ├── Use earliest Volume Adjusted High-Low Range in the window
│   └── Subtract the first from the last
└── Combine Factors
    ├── Multiply the 20-day Momentum by the Volume Shock indicator
    ├── Add the High-Low Range Momentum
    └── Multiply by the difference in Volume Adjusted High-Low Range
        └── Interpretation: The combined factor aims to capture strong price momentum with significant volume surges, along with the trend strength indicated by the high-low range and open-close price changes, potentially signaling a continuation or reversal trend.
