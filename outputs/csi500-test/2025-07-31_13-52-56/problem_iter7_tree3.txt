Integrated Price and Volume Shock with High-Low Range Momentum
├── Calculate 30-Day Price Momentum
│   ├── Get the close price of day t
│   ├── Get the close price of day t-30
│   └── Subtract close price of day t-30 from close price of day t, then divide by close price of day t-30
├── Identify Volume Shock
│   ├── Get the volume of day t
│   ├── Get the average volume of the last 30 days (excluding day t)
│   └── Assign value: 1 if day t volume > 2 * 30-day average, else 0
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Use Low price of day t
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate High-Low Range Momentum
│   ├── Store the range in each period over N periods
│   └── Subtract the first range in the window from the last
└── Combine Factors
    ├── Multiply the 30-day Momentum by the Volume Shock indicator
    └── Add the High-Low Range Momentum
        └── Interpretation: The combined factor captures strong price momentum with significant volume surges, along with the trend strength indicated by the high-low range, potentially signaling a continuation or reversal trend.
