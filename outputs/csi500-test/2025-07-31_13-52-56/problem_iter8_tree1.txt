Volume-Adjusted High-to-Low Range with Enhanced Momentum and Volume Shock
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Adjust for Volume
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply High-to-Low Range by Volume
├── Calculate 30-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Subtract close price of day t-30 from close price of day t
│   └── Divide the result by the close price of day t-30
├── Identify Volume Shock
│   ├── Compare day t volume with 30-day average volume (excluding day t)
│   └── Assign value: 1 if day t volume > 2 * 30-day average, else 0
├── Enhance Price Momentum with High-Low Range
│   ├── Calculate the high-low range for the past 30 days
│   │   ├── Take the highest high price over the past 30 days
│   │   ├── Take the lowest low price over the past 30 days
│   │   └── Subtract the lowest low from the highest high to get the range
│   └── Normalize the 30-day Price Momentum using the high-low range
│       ├── Divide the 30-day Price Momentum by the high-low range
├── Combine Adjusted Range with Enhanced Momentum
│   ├── Use Adjusted High-to-Low Range
│   └── Add Enhanced 30-day Price Momentum
└── Combine Enhanced Momentum and Volume Shock
    ├── Multiply the combined Adjusted Range and Enhanced Momentum by the Volume Shock indicator
    └── Interpretation: A high positive or negative value indicates a strong price momentum relative to the recent price range, accompanied by a significant volume surge, potentially signaling a more robust continuation trend.
