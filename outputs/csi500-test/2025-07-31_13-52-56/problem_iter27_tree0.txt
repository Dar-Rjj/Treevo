- Use price and volume data to generate alpha factors
  - Calculate the daily return based on close prices
    - Use the difference between today's close and yesterday's close
  - Create a factor based on the relationship between open, high, low, and close prices
    - Calculate the upper shadow (high - max(open, close))
      - Evaluate the ratio of the upper shadow to the range (high - low) as a bearish indicator
    - Calculate the lower shadow (min(open, close) - low)
      - Evaluate the ratio of the lower shadow to the range (high - low) as a bullish indicator
  - Generate a momentum factor using the average of past n days' returns
    - Sum up the last n days' daily returns
    - Divide the sum by the number of days, n, to get an average return
  - Develop a volatility factor using the standard deviation of past n days' returns
    - Calculate the standard deviation of the last n days' daily returns
  - Incorporate volume into the factor creation
    - Calculate the change in volume from the previous day
    - Multiply the daily return by the change in volume to emphasize significant movements
  - Combine multiple factors to create a composite score
    - Assign weights to each individual factor based on their predictive power
    - Sum up the weighted factors to form a single composite score
  - Utilize specific patterns in the data for additional insights
    - Look for specific candlestick patterns, such as engulfing patterns or doji patterns
    - Assign a score based on the presence of these patterns and their historical performance
