- Use price, volume, and amount data to generate alpha factors
  - Calculate the daily return based on close prices
    - Use the difference between today's close and yesterday's close
  - Create a factor based on the relationship between open, high, low, and close prices
    - Calculate the upper shadow (high - max(open, close))
      - Evaluate the ratio of the upper shadow to the range (high - low) as a bearish indicator
    - Calculate the lower shadow (min(open, close) - low)
      - Evaluate the ratio of the lower shadow to the range (high - low) as a bullish indicator
  - Generate a momentum factor using the average of past n days' returns
    - Sum up the last n days' daily returns
    - Divide the sum by the number of days, n, to get an average return
  - Develop a volatility factor using the standard deviation of past n days' returns
    - Calculate the standard deviation of the last n days' daily returns
  - Incorporate volume into the factor creation
    - Calculate the change in volume from the previous day
    - Multiply the daily return by the change in volume to emphasize significant movements
  - Utilize specific patterns in the data for additional insights
    - Look for specific candlestick patterns, such as engulfing patterns or doji patterns
    - Assign a score based on the presence of these patterns and their historical performance
  - Calculate Intraday Return and Adjustments
    - (High price - Low price) / Low price
    - (Intraday Return / (High price - Low price))
  - Compute 30-day Price Momentum
    - (Close price of day t - Close price of day t-30) / Close price of day t-30
  - Analyze Volume and Amount Shocks
    - (Day t volume > 2 * 30-day average volume) ? 1 : 0
    - (Day t amount > 2 * 30-day average amount) ? 1 : 0
  - Enhanced Volume and Price Volatility Components
    - (High - Low) * Volume
      - Sum over N days
    - Open-to-Close Price Change: Close - Open
      - Sum over N days
    - Volume Moving Average: 10-day window
    - (+1 if Current Volume > Moving Average, -1 otherwise)
    - (Sum of past n days' volume[t] - Sum of past n days' volume[t-n])
  - Composite Alpha Factors Synthesis
    - (Volume Momentum * (High / Low))
    - (-1 * Volume Momentum)
    - (Inverted Volume Momentum + Adjusted Volume Momentum + (High - Low) * Volume * Volume Momentum)
    - (High / Low) * Volume Trend
  - Weighted and Integrated Alpha Factor
    - (0.2 * Adjusted Intraday Return)
    - (0.3 * 30-day Price Momentum)
    - (0.1 * Volume Shock * Amount Shock)
    - (0.2 * Adjusted Volume Momentum)
    - (0.15 * Inverted Volume Momentum)
    - (0.1 * Composite Alpha)
    - (Weighted Intraday Return and Adjustments + Weighted 30-day Price Momentum + Weighted Volume and Amount Shocks + Weighted Adjusted Volume Momentum + Weighted Inverted Volume Momentum + Weighted Composite Alpha)
  - Incorporate Volume Trend
    - (Use Volume)
    - (Compute the difference between volume at day t and day t-30) / Volume at day t-30
    - Multiply Final Alpha by 30-day Volume Momentum
  - Combine multiple factors to create a composite score
    - Assign weights to each individual factor based on their predictive power
    - Sum up the weighted factors to form a single composite score
  - Interpretation
    - Positive Values: Strong intraday and long-term momentum, significant volume and amount surges, high High-Low ratio, and positive volume trends.
    - Negative Values: Weak intraday and long-term momentum, low volume and amount, weak High-Low ratio, and negative volume trends.
