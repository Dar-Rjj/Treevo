Thought: Explore trend and momentum indicators using price and volume
- Sub-thought: Calculate simple moving averages (SMA) for different time periods
  - Sub-thought: SMA_5 (5-day Simple Moving Average)
  - Sub-thought: SMA_20 (20-day Simple Moving Average)
  - Sub-thought: SMA_50 (50-day Simple Moving Average)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between short-term and long-term SMAs (e.g., SMA_5 - SMA_20, SMA_20 - SMA_50)
- Sub-thought: Use high and low prices to compute the average true range (ATR)
  - Sub-thought: ATR_14 (14-day Average True Range)
- Sub-thought: Calculate price change over a certain period
  - Sub-thought: Price_Change_1D (Today's Close - Yesterday's Close)
  - Sub-thought: Price_Change_5D (Today's Close - 5 days ago Close)
- Sub-thought: Analyze volume trends
  - Sub-thought: Volume_SMA_5 (5-day Simple Moving Average of Volume)
  - Sub-thought: Volume_SMA_20 (20-day Simple Moving Average of Volume)
  - Sub-thought: Volume_OSC (Volume Oscillator: (Volume_SMA_5 - Volume_SMA_20) / Volume_SMA_20)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the accumulation/distribution line (ADL)
  - Sub-thought: ADL = Previous ADL + Current Close - Previous Close
- Sub-thought: Investigate the relationship between price and volume
  - Sub-thought: Price_Volume_Ratio (Close / Volume)
  - Sub-thought: Price_Change_Volume_Ratio (Price_Change_1D / Volume)
- Sub-thought: Create a composite factor combining multiple indicators
  - Sub-thought: Composite_Factor = (SMA_5 - SMA_20) + (ATR_14 * 0.5) + (Price_Change_5D / Price_Change_1D) + (Volume_OSC * 0.3)
