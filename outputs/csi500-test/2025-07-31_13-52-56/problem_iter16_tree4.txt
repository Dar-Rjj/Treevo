Crossover High-Low Price and Volume Dynamics for Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Enhanced High-to-Low Price Ratio
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Evaluate Volume Trend
│   ├── Compute Volume Moving Average (10 days)
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Compare Current Volume to Moving Average
│       ├── Assign +1 for Increasing
│       └── Assign -1 for Decreasing
├── Integrate Components for Alpha Factor
    ├── Adjusted High-Low Price Ratio with Volume Trend
    │   ├── Multiply High-to-Low Price Ratio by Volume Trend (+1/-1)
    └── Ensure Interpretation
        ├── Positive Values: High-to-Low ratio is high, and volume is increasing
        └── Negative Values: High-to-Low ratio is low, and volume is decreasing
