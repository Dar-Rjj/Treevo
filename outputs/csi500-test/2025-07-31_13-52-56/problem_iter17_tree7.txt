Crossover of Weighted High-to-Low Range with Momentum and Volume Signal and Synthesis of Enhanced Momentum, High-Low Range, and Intraday Volatility for Alpha Prediction
├── Calculate Adjusted High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   ├── Use Low price
│   └── Subtract Low from High
├── Adjust for Volume
│   ├── Use Volume
│   └── Multiply Adjusted High-to-Low Range by sqrt(Volume)
├── Calculate 30-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Compute the difference between close price at day t and day t-30
│       └── Divide the result by the close price at day t-30
├── Enhance Price Momentum with High-Low Range
│   ├── Take the highest high price over the past 30 days
│   ├── Take the lowest low price over the past 30 days
│   └── Subtract the lowest low from the highest high to get the range
│       └── Divide the 30-day Price Momentum by the high-low range
├── Identify Volume Shock
│   ├── Compare day t volume with 30-day average volume (excluding day t)
│   └── Assign value: 1 if day t volume > 2 * 30-day average, else 0
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Use High price
│   ├── Use Low price
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Use Open price
│       └── Combine into a single volatility measure
├── Adjust Intraday Return by Intraday Volatility
│   └── Divide Intraday Return by Intraday Volatility
├── Combine Adjusted Range, 30-day Momentum, Volume Shock, and Intraday Adjusted
│   ├── Use Adjusted High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Add 30-day Price Momentum
│   ├── Multiply by Volume Shock
│   └── Multiply by Intraday Volatility Adjusted
├── Detect Volume Spike
│   ├── Compute 5-day Moving Average of Volume
│   │   ├── Take the average of the last 5 days' volumes
│   └── Determine if Current Volume is a Spike
│       ├── Compare current volume to 5-day moving average
│       └── If current volume > 1.7 * 5-day moving average, set spike flag to 1, else 0
├── Calculate 10-day Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Take the difference between Close price of day t and day t-10
├── Combine Adjusted Range, 10-day Momentum, and Volume Spike
│   ├── Add 10-day Momentum Signal to Adjusted High-to-Low Range
│   └── Multiply by Volume Spike Flag
│       ├── If spike flag is 1, factor value is multiplied by 2.5, else remains unchanged
├── Synthesize Final Alpha Factor
│   ├── Add the results from the 30-day Momentum and Volume Shock
│   └── Add the results from the Combined Adjusted Range, 10-day Momentum, and Volume Spike
│       └── The final alpha factor combines both short-term and long-term momentum signals
│           with volume shock and spike adjustments, providing a more robust signal for
│           predicting future stock returns.
└── Interpretation: The improved alpha factor integrates adjusted high-to-low range, 30-day 
    and 10-day price momentum, high-low range momentum, open-close price change momentum, 
    intraday volatility, significant volume events, and volume impact, offering a comprehensive 
    signal for predicting future stock returns.
