Integrated and Weighted High-Low Range, Volume Dynamics, and Momentum Synthesis for Enhanced Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Enhanced High-Low Range and Its Volume-Adjusted Version
│   ├── Compute High-Low Range: High - Low
│   └── Multiply High-to-Low Range by sqrt(Volume)
├── Evaluate Cumulative and Dynamic High-Low Measures
│   ├── Calculate Cumulative High-Low Range: Sum of Volume Adjusted High-Low Range over N days
│   └── Calculate High-to-Low Price Ratio: High / Low
├── Analyze Volume Trends and Momentum
│   ├── Compute Volume Moving Average: Use Volume with a 10-day window
│   ├── Determine Volume Trend: +1 if Current Volume > Moving Average, 0 otherwise
│   └── Measure Volume Momentum: Change in Aggregated Volume (Sum of past n days' volume)
│       ├── Aggregated Volume at t-1
│       └── Aggregated Volume at t-n
├── Integrate Open-Close Momentum with Volatility Indicators
│   ├── Calculate Open-to-Close Price Change: Close - Open
│   └── Compute 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close price
│       ├── Calculate EMA using a smoothing factor of 2 / (10 + 1)
├── Synthesize Components into Alpha Factor
│   ├── Combine Volume Trend with High-Low Price Ratio: (High / Low) * Volume Trend
│   ├── Incorporate Volume Momentum and Adjusted High-Low Range: (High - Low) * sqrt(Volume) * Volume Momentum
│   ├── Integrate Open-Close Momentum with Volume-Adjusted High-Low Range: (Close - Open) * (High - Low) * sqrt(Volume)
│   └── Subtract Momentum Signal from Integrated Adjusted High-Low Range
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Use the Integrated Component from Synthesize Step
    └── Ensure Interpretation
        ├── Positive Values: Strong High-Low ratio, increasing volume, and positive momentum
        └── Negative Values: Weak High-Low ratio, decreasing volume, and negative momentum
