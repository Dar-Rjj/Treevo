Crossover and Integration of High-Low Price, Volume, Momentum for Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Enhanced High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Adjust for Volume
│   ├── Multiply High-to-Low Range by sqrt(Volume)
├── Evaluate Volume Trend
│   ├── Compute Volume Moving Average (10 days)
│   └── Compare Current Volume to Moving Average
│       ├── Assign +1 for Increasing
│       └── Assign -1 for Decreasing
├── Integrate Volume Trend with Adjusted Range
    ├── Multiply Adjusted High-to-Low Range by Volume Trend (+1/-1)
├── Calculate Momentum Signal
│   ├── Compute 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close price
│       ├── Calculate EMA using a smoothing factor of 2 / (11)
├── Combine Adjusted Range, Momentum, and Volume Trend
    ├── Subtract Momentum Signal from Integrated Adjusted High-to-Low Range
    └── Interpretation
        ├── Positive Values: High-to-Low range is high, volume is increasing, and momentum is low
        └── Negative Values: High-to-Low range is low, volume is decreasing, and momentum is high
