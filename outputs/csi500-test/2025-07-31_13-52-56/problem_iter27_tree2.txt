    Sub-thought: Calculate the daily range (high - low)
        Sub-thought: Use the daily range as a raw factor to predict future returns
    Sub-thought: Calculate the average daily range over the past N days
        Sub-thought: Compare today's range with the average range to identify unusual volatility
            Sub-thought: Use the difference between today's range and the average range as a factor
Thought: Analyze the trading volume for liquidity and market activity
    Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the current day's volume and the previous day's volume

    Sub-thought: Calculate the average volume over the past N days
        Sub-thought: Compare today's volume with the average volume to identify unusual trading activity
            Sub-thought: Use the ratio of today's volume to the average volume as a factor
Thought: Examine the closing price relative to the day's range
    Sub-thought: Calculate the position of the close within the day's range (close - low) / (high - low)
        Sub-thought: Use the position of the close as a raw factor to predict future returns
    Sub-thought: Calculate the average position of the close over the past N days
        Sub-thought: Compare today's close position with the average position to identify changes in closing behavior
            Sub-thought: Use the difference between today's close position and the average position as a factor
Thought: Investigate the relationship between the open and close prices
    Sub-thought: Calculate the return from the open to the close (close - open) / open
        Sub-thought: Use the open-to-close return as a raw factor to predict future returns
    Sub-thought: Calculate the average open-to-close return over the past N days
        Sub-thought: Compare today's open-to-close return with the average return to identify significant changes
            Sub-thought: Use the difference between today's open-to-close return and the average return as a factor
Thought: Analyze the amount traded
    Sub-thought: Calculate the total amount traded (volume * close)
        Sub-thought: Use the total amount traded as a raw factor to predict future returns
    Sub-thought: Calculate the average amount traded over the past N days
        Sub-thought: Compare today's amount traded with the average amount to identify significant changes
