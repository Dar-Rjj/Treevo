Thought: Synthesize Price and Volume-Based Alpha Factors for Predicting Future Stock Returns
- Sub-thought: Explore Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Calculate SMA of closing prices for 5, 10, and 20 days
  - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between the current close and each SMA
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing prices over the last 5 and 10 days
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the RSI (Relative Strength Index) over a 14-day period
- Sub-thought: Examine Trading Volume Patterns and Trends
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of current volume to the 20-day average volume
  - Sub-thought: Determine if the volume is above or below its 20-day moving average
  - Sub-thought: Compute Volume Moving Average: Use Volume with a 10-day window
  - Sub-thought: Determine Volume Trend: +1 if Current Volume > Moving Average, 0 otherwise
  - Sub-thought: Measure Volume Momentum: Change in Aggregated Volume (Sum of past n days' volume)
    - Sub-thought: Aggregated Volume at t-1
    - Sub-thought: Aggregated Volume at t-n
- Sub-thought: Investigate Volatility and High-Low Range
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over the last 20 days
  - Sub-thought: Compare the current day's return to the 20-day standard deviation
  - Sub-thought: Compute High-Low Range: High - Low
  - Sub-thought: Compute Volume Adjusted High-Low Range: (High - Low) * sqrt(Volume)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Cumulative High-Low Range: Sum of Volume Adjusted High-Low Range over N days
  - Sub-thought: Calculate High-to-Low Price Ratio: High / Low
- Sub-thought: Integrate Open-Close Momentum with Other Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Open-to-Close Price Change: Close - Open
  - Sub-thought: Compute 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close price
    - Sub-thought: Calculate EMA using a smoothing factor of 2 / (10 + 1)
- Sub-thought: Construct Novel Alpha Factors by Combining Components
  - Sub-thought: Create a factor by multiplying the 5-day price change with the 20-day volume ratio
  - Sub-thought: Construct a factor from the 10-day RSI and the 20-day average volume
  - Sub-thought: Combine Volume Trend with High-Low Price Ratio: (High / Low) * Volume Trend
  - Sub-thought: Incorporate Volume Momentum and Adjusted High-Low Range: (High - Low) * sqrt(Volume) * Volume Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Integrate Open-Close Momentum with Volume-Adjusted High-Low Range: (Close - Open) * (High - Low) * sqrt(Volume)
- Sub-thought: Final Alpha Factor
  - Sub-thought: Use the Integrated Component from the Construct Novel Alpha Factors Step
  - Sub-thought: Ensure Interpretation
    - Sub-thought: Positive Values: Strong High-Low ratio, increasing volume, and positive momentum
    - Sub-thought: Negative Values: Weak High-Low ratio, decreasing volume, and negative momentum
