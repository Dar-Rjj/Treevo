Thought: Explore Price Patterns for Alpha Generation
- Sub-thought: Analyze Open, High, Low, Close Prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate Intraday Volatility
    - Formula: Intraday_Volatility = (High - Low) / Open
  - Sub-sub-thought: Measure Over-night Gap
    - Formula: Overnight_Gap = (Open - Previous_Close) / Previous_Close
- Sub-thought: Examine Volume and Amount for Market Sentiment
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute Volume Momentum
    - Formula: Volume_Momentum = Current_Volume / Average(Volumes of last 5 days)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Evaluate Amount to Volume Ratio for Buying Power
    - Formula: Amount_Volume_Ratio = Amount / Volume
- Sub-thought: Develop Technical Indicators Based on Historical Data
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for Trend Analysis
    - Formula: SMA_10 = Sum(Close of last 10 days) / 10
  - Sub-sub-thought: Design Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) for Recent Trend Weighting
    - Formula: EMA_10 = (Close * 2 / (1 + 10)) + (Previous_EMA_10 * (1 - 2 / (1 + 10)))
  - Sub-sub-thought: Construct Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for Trend Strength
    - Formula: MACD = EMA_12 - EMA_26
- Sub-thought: Incorporate Volume into Technical Indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Adjusted Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Formula: VWAP = Sum(Close * Volume) / Sum(Volume)
  - Sub-sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV) for Cumulative Buying/Selling Pressure
    - Formula: OBV[t] = OBV[t-1] + (Volume if Close > Previous_Close else -Volume if Close < Previous_Close else 0)
- Sub-thought: Analyze Relative Strength Compared to a Benchmark
  - Sub-sub-thought: Stock-to-Market Return Ratio
    - Formula: Stock_to_Market_Return = (Close - Previous_Close) / Previous_Close - Market_Return
  - Sub-sub-thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Overbought/Oversold Conditions
    - Formula: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Average(Up Moves) / Average(Down Moves))))
- Sub-thought: Investigate Seasonality and Calendar Effects
  - Sub-sub-thought: Monthly Performance Analysis
    - Formula: Monthly_Performance = (End_of_Month_Close - Start_of_Month_Close) / Start_of_Month_Close
  - Sub-sub-thought: Day-of-Week Effect
    - Formula: DayOfWeek_Return = (Close - Open) / Open grouped by DayOfWeek
- Sub-thought: Study the Impact of Trading Range Expansion/Contraction
  - Sub-sub-thought: Bollinger Bands for Volatility Squeezes
    - Formula: Bollinger_Band_Upper = SMA_20 + 2 * Standard_Deviation(Close over 20 days)
    - Formula: Bollinger_Band_Lower = SMA_20 - 2 * Standard_Deviation(Close over 20 days)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Keltner Channels for Mean Reversion
    - Formula: Keltner_Channel_Upper = EMA_20 + 2 * ATR_20
    - Formula: Keltner_Channel_Lower = EMA_20 - 2 * ATR_20
    - Formula: ATR_20 = Average(True_Range over 20 days)
