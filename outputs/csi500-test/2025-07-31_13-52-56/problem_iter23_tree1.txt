Crossover and Integration of Price, Volume, and Momentum for Novel Alpha Factors
├── Calculate Enhanced High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Adjust for Volume
│   ├── Multiply High-to-Low Range by sqrt(Volume)
├── Evaluate Volume Trend
│   ├── Compute Volume Moving Average (10 days)
│   └── Compare Current Volume to Moving Average
│       ├── Assign +1 for Increasing
│       └── Assign -1 for Decreasing
├── Integrate Volume Trend with Adjusted Range
│   ├── Multiply Adjusted High-to-Low Range by Volume Trend (+1/-1)
├── Calculate Momentum Signal
│   ├── Compute 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close price
│   │   ├── Calculate EMA using a smoothing factor of 2 / (11)
└── Combine Adjusted Range, Momentum, and Volume Trend
    ├── Subtract Momentum Signal from Integrated Adjusted High-to-Low Range
    ├── Interpretation
    │   ├── Positive Values: High-to-Low range is high, volume is increasing, and momentum is low
    │   └── Negative Values: High-to-Low range is low, volume is decreasing, and momentum is high
├── Calculate Relative Strength
│   ├── Compute the ratio of Close price to the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close price
└── Incorporate Relative Strength into Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply the Combined Alpha Factor by the Relative Strength
    └── Interpretation
        ├── Positive Values: High relative strength, indicating strong upward trend
        └── Negative Values: Low relative strength, indicating weak or downward trend
