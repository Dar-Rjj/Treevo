Synthesized High-to-Low Price and Volume Dynamics with Momentum and Range Expansion
├── Calculate Enhanced High-to-Low Price Ratio
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Evaluate Volume Trend and Momentum
│   ├── Compute Volume Moving Average
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Choose a Window (e.g., 10 days)
│   ├── Determine if Volume is Increasing or Decreasing
│   │   ├── Compare Current Volume to Moving Average
│   │   └── Assign +1 for Increasing, -1 for Decreasing
│   └── Measure Volume Momentum Indicator
│       ├── Aggregate Daily Volumes
│       │   └── Sum of past n days' volume
│       └── Compute Change in Aggregated Volume
│           ├── Aggregated Volume at t-1
│           └── Aggregated Volume at t-n
├── Quantify High-Low Range and Volatility
│   ├── Calculate High-Low Range Ratio
│   │   ├── High price
│   │   └── Low price
│   └── Calculate Average True Range
│       ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices
│       └── Take average over past n days
└── Integrate Components for Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine High-to-Low Price Ratio with Volume Trend
    │   ├── Multiply High-to-Low Price Ratio by Volume Trend (+1/-1)
    └── Incorporate Volume Momentum and Range Expansion
        ├── Adjusted High-Low Range Ratio (No normalization here)
        │   ├── Multiply by Volume Momentum
        │   └── Consider Sign of Volume Momentum
        │       ├── Positive
        │       └── Negative
        └── Ensure Interpretation
            ├── Positive Values: High-to-Low ratio is high, and volume is increasing
            └── Negative Values: High-to-Low ratio is low, and volume is decreasing
