Thought: Integrated and Enhanced Alpha Factors Using Price, Volume, and Momentum
- Sub-thought: Calculate Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for Different Periods
  - Sub-thought: Calculate SMA of closing prices for 5, 10, and 20 days
  - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between the current close and each SMA
- Sub-thought: Analyze Price Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing prices over the last 5 and 10 days
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the 30-day price momentum
    - Sub-thought: (Close price of day t - Close price of day t-30) / Close price of day t-30
- Sub-thought: Investigate Intraday Volatility and Adjustments
  - Sub-thought: Calculate intraday return
    - Sub-thought: (High price - Low price) / Low price
  - Sub-thought: Adjust intraday return by volatility
    - Sub-thought: (Intraday Return / Intraday Volatility)
- Sub-thought: Examine Trading Volume Patterns
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of current volume to the 20-day average volume
  - Sub-thought: Determine if the volume is above or below its 20-day moving average
  - Sub-thought: Calculate 10-day volume moving average
  - Sub-thought: Determine volume trend
    - Sub-thought: +1 if Current Volume > Moving Average, -1 otherwise
  - Sub-thought: Calculate volume momentum
    - Sub-thought: (Sum of past n days' volume[t] - Sum of past n days' volume[t-n])
- Sub-thought: Consider Price and Volume Together
  - Sub-thought: Create a factor by multiplying the 5-day price change with the 20-day volume ratio
  - Sub-thought: Construct a factor from the 10-day RSI and the 20-day average volume
  - Sub-thought: Measure high-low range and adjustments
    - Sub-thought: (High - Low) * Volume
    - Sub-thought: Cumulative volume-adjusted high-low range: Sum over N days
  - Sub-thought: Open-to-close price change and momentum
    - Sub-thought: Open-to-close price change: Close - Open
    - Sub-thought: Cumulative open-to-close price change: Sum over N days
- Sub-thought: Composite Alpha Factors Synthesis
  - Sub-thought: Adjusted volume momentum: (Volume Momentum * (High / Low))
  - Sub-thought: Inverted volume momentum: (-1 * Volume Momentum)
  - Sub-thought: Composite alpha: (Inverted Volume Momentum + Adjusted Volume Momentum + (High - Low) * Volume * Volume Momentum)

    - Sub-thought: (0.15 * Inverted Volume Momentum)
  - Sub-thought: Weighted composite alpha
    - Sub-thought: (0.15 * Composite Alpha)
  - Sub-thought: Final alpha: (Weighted Intraday Return and Adjustments + Weighted 30-day Price Momentum + Weighted Volume and Amount Shocks + Weighted Adjusted Volume Momentum + Weighted Inverted Volume Momentum + Weighted Composite Alpha)
- Sub-thought: Incorporate Volume Trend
  - Sub-thought: Calculate 30-day volume momentum
    - Sub-thought: Use Volume
    - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between volume at day t and day t-30
      - Sub-thought: Divide the result by the volume at day t-30
  - Sub-thought: Multiply final alpha by 30-day volume momentum
- Sub-thought: Interpretation
  - Sub-thought: Positive values: Strong intraday and long-term momentum, significant volume and amount surges, high High-Low ratio, and positive volume trends.
  - Sub-thought: Negative values: Weak intraday and
