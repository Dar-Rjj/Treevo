Integrated Price and Volume Shock with Enhanced Momentum and High-Low Range
├── Calculate 30-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Price Momentum
│   ├── Get the close price of day t
│   ├── Get the EMA of the close prices for the last 30 days (including day t)
│   └── Subtract EMA from the close price of day t, then divide by the EMA
├── Identify Sustained Volume Surge
│   ├── Get the volume of day t
│   ├── Get the average volume of the last 50 days (excluding day t)
│   └── Assign value: 1 if day t volume > 1.5 * 50-day average and sustained for 3 consecutive days, else 0
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Use Low price of day t
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate High-Low Range 60-Day Momentum
│   ├── Store the range in each period over 60 periods
│   └── Subtract the first range in the window from the last
└── Combine Factors
    ├── Multiply the 30-day EMA Momentum by the Sustained Volume Surge indicator
    └── Add the High-Low Range 60-Day Momentum
        └── Interpretation: The combined factor captures strong price momentum with significant and sustained volume surges, along with the trend strength indicated by the high-low range, potentially signaling a continuation or reversal trend.
