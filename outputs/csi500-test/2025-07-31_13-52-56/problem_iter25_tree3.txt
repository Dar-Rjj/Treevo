Crossover Enhanced Volume, Price Volatility, and High-Low Dynamics for Composite Alpha
├── Calculate Adjusted Volume Momentum
│   ├── Sum of past n days' volume (V_sum)
│   └── Change in V_sum: V_change = (V_sum[t] - V_sum[t-n])
├── Measure and Adjust High-Low Price Ratio
│   ├── High-Low Range Ratio (H/L)
│   ├── Compute Volume Moving Average (10 days)
│   └── Multiply H/L by Volume Trend (+1 for Increasing, -1 for Decreasing)
├── Price Volatility
│   └── Standard Deviation of Close Prices over n days
└── Weighted Combined Alpha
    └── Final Alpha: (0.5 * Adjusted Volume Momentum + 0.5 * Price Volatility)
