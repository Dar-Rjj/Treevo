Synthesized Price and Volume Dynamics Factor for Predicting Returns
├── Calculate Adjusted Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   │   ├── Obtain Close prices for the past 14 days
│   │   └── Calculate the average of the past 14 Close prices
│   └── Subtract recent (current day) close from the average
├── Incorporate Volume Impact
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   ├── Obtain current day's Volume
│   │   └── Obtain average Volume over the past 14 days
│   └── Calculate Volume Change Ratio
│       ├── Divide current day's Volume by the 14-day average Volume
│       └── Multiply the Adjusted Price Momentum by the Volume Change Ratio
├── Assess Daily Price Movement Intensity
│   ├── Use High and Low prices
│   └── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Price Indicator
│   ├── Multiply Close price by Volume
│   └── Divide Sum by Total Volume
├── Determine Deviation from Volume-Weighted Average Price
│   ├── Subtract Volume-Adjusted Price Indicator from Close price
│   └── Use deviation as a measure without normalization
├── Identify Reversal or Continuation Potential
│   ├── Compare Current Deviation with Previous Day
│   │   ├── Is current deviation > previous?
│   │   └── If Yes, trend might be reversing
│   └── Check for Volume Increase
│       ├── Compare Current Volume with Moving Average
│       │   ├── Take Moving Average of Volume over 14 days
│       │   └── If Current Volume > MA, supports reversal
└── Final Score Calculation
    ├── Combine Adjusted Price Momentum, Volume Impact, and Reversal Potential
    │   ├── If Deviation indicates trend reversal and Volume increased
    │   └── Assign higher score for stronger indication
    ├── Apply to Predict Future Returns
    │   ├── Higher score means higher likelihood of reversal or continuation
    └── Use as a Factor for Stock Selection or Timing
