  - Action: Compute the percentage change in closing price over the last 20 days
- Sub-thought: Measure Price Volatility
  - Action: Calculate the standard deviation of daily closing prices over the last 20 days
- Sub-thought: Analyze Volume Trends
  - Action: Compute the average trading volume over the last 5 days
  - Action: Compute the percentage change in average trading volume over the last 20 days
- Sub-thought: Combine Momentum and Volume Indicators
  - Action: Multiply short-term price momentum by the 5-day average trading volume
- Sub-thought: Assess High-Low Range Dynamics
  - Action: Calculate the ratio of the 5-day average high price to the 5-day average low price
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Open-Close Price Behavior
  - Action: Compute the difference between the 5-day average open and close prices
  - Action: Determine if the 5-day average open price is higher or lower than the 5-day average close price
- Sub-thought: Analyze Volume and Price Correlation
  - Action: Compute the correlation coefficient between 5-day price changes and 5-day volume changes
- Sub-thought: Identify Reversal Patterns
  - Action: Check if the 5-day price momentum is negative and the 20-day price momentum is positive
  - Action: Check if the 5-day price momentum is positive and the 20-day price momentum is negative
- Sub-thought: Calculate Daily Returns
  - Action: Compute the percentage change in closing price from day t-1 to day t
- Sub-thought: Compute Exponentially Smoothed Moving Average of Daily Returns
  - Action: Set Lookback Period (n, e.g., 20 days)
  - Action: Apply Exponential Smoothing (Smoothing Factor α, e.g., 0.1)
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Change
  - Action: Use Volume of day t
  - Action: Use Volume of day (t-1)
- Sub-thought: Compute Price Momentum Factor
  - Action: Use Daily Returns over the past n days
  - Action: Sum the Daily Returns
- Sub-thought: Compute Volume Momentum Factor
  - Action: Use Volume Changes over the past m days
  - Action: Sum the Volume Changes
- Sub-thought: Calculate High-Low Range
  - Action: Use High price
  - Action: Subtract Low price
- Sub-thought: Calculate Price Breakout Ratio
  - Action: Use (High price - Open price)
  - Action: Divide by High-Low Range
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
  - Action: Multiply Close price by Volume
  - Action: Divide Sum by Total Volume
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume-Weighted Breakout Indicator
  - Action: Multiply (Close price - Open price) by Volume
  - Action: Multiply result with Price Breakout Ratio
- Sub-thought: Aggregate Indicators
  - Action: Sum Volume-Weighted Breakout Indicators

  - Action: Sum the Volume-Weighted Breakout Ratios
- Sub-thought: Determine Daily Return Deviation from VWAP
  - Action: Subtract VWAP from Close price
- Sub-thought: Identify Trend Reversal Potential
  - Action: Compare Daily Return Deviation with Previous Day
    - If current deviation > previous, trend might be reversing
  - Action: Check for Volume Increase
    - Compare Current Volume with Moving Average
      - Take Moving Average of Volume over 14 days
      - If Current Volume > MA, supports reversal
- Sub-thought: Combine Price and Volume Momentum
  - Action: Multiply Price Momentum by a constant k1
  - Action: Multiply Volume Momentum by a constant k2
  - Action: Sum the two weighted momentums
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Weight
