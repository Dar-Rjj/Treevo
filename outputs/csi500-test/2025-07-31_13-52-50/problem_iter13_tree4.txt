- Develop momentum indicators
  - Calculate simple moving average (SMA) of close prices over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days)
    - SMA_5: 5-day Simple Moving Average
    - SMA_10: 10-day Simple Moving Average
    - SMA_20: 20-day Simple Moving Average
  - Calculate relative strength index (RSI) using close prices
    - RSI: Relative Strength Index
- Analyze price movement
  - Calculate the daily return
    - Daily_Return: (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
  - Calculate the high-low ratio
    - High_Low_Ratio: (High_t - Low_t) / Close_(t-1)
- Examine volume trends
  - Calculate on-balance volume (OBV)
    - OBV: Cumulative sum of volume adjusted for positive or negative price change
  - Calculate volume weighted average price (VWAP)
    - VWAP: (Cumulative Sum of (Volume * Typical Price)) / (Cumulative Sum of Volume)
- Identify volatility
  - Calculate average true range (ATR) over a period (e.g., 14 days)
    - ATR: Average of the True Range over 14 days
  - Calculate standard deviation of daily returns over a period (e.g., 20 days)
    - Volatility: Standard Deviation of Daily Returns
- Detect trend reversals
  - Calculate the moving average convergence divergence (MACD)
    - MACD: (12-day EMA of Close - 26-day EMA of Close)
    - Signal_Line: 9-day EMA of MACD
    - MACD_Histogram: MACD - Signal_Line
  - Calculate the rate of change (ROC)
    - ROC: (Close_t - Close_(t-n)) / Close_(t-n) * 100
- Analyze trading volume
  - Calculate the volume change
    - Volume_Change: (Volume_t - Volume_(t-1)) / Volume_(t-1)
- Identify support and resistance levels
  - Calculate the pivot points
    - Pivot: (High + Low + Close) / 3
    - Resistance_1: (2 * Pivot) - Low
    - Support_1: (2 * Pivot) - High
- Assess market sentiment
  - Calculate the accumulation/distribution line (A/D Line)
    - A/D_Line: Cumulative sum of (Close - Low) - (High - Close) / (High - Low) * Volume
- Evaluate market breadth
  - Calculate the advance-decline line
    - Advance_Decline: Cumulative sum of (Number of advancing stocks - Number of declining stocks)
- Identify money flow
  - Calculate the money flow index (MFI)
    - MFI: 100 - (100 / (1 + Money Flow Ratio))
    - Money_Flow_Ratio: (Positive Money Flow / Negative Money Flow)
- Monitor market volatility
  - Calculate the Bollinger Bands
    - Middle_Band: 20-day SMA of Close
    - Upper_Band: Middle_Band + 2 * 20-day Standard Deviation of Close
    - Lower_Band: Middle_Band - 2 * 20-day Standard Deviation of Close
- Track trade signals
  - Generate buy/sell signals based on crossovers
    - Buy_Signal: When Short-Term SMA crosses above Long-Term SMA
    - Sell_Signal: When Short-Term SMA crosses below Long-Term SMA
- Evaluate trend strength
  - Calculate the average directional index (ADX)
    - ADX: Smoothing of DX over 14 days
    - DX: Absolute value of (+DI - -DI) / (+DI + -DI) * 100
    - +DI: 14-day EMA of (+DM / ATR) * 100
    - -DI: 14-day EMA of (-DM / ATR) * 100
    - +DM: Up move when High_t > High_(t-1) and Low_(t-1) < Low_t
    - -DM: Down move when Low_t < Low_(t-1) and High_(t-1) > High_t
