Thought: Calculate the difference between closing price and opening price as a simple daily return indicator.
  Sub-thought: Identify the relationship between today's daily return and the sum of the last three days' daily returns, aiming to capture recent momentum.
    Sub-thought: Add the ratio of the highest price to the lowest price over the past week (7 days) to the previous measure. This introduces a volatility component and could signal potential breakouts or strong trends.
  Sub-thought: Consider the impact of volume on price movements by calculating the product of the daily return and the volume. This can help in understanding the conviction behind the move.
    Sub-thought: Incorporate the change in volume from the previous day to the current one, alongside the volume-adjusted return. The idea is to assess if an increase or decrease in trading activity accompanies the price movement, which might signal a stronger trend continuation or reversal.
Thought: Measure the distance between the closing price and a short-term moving average (e.g., 5-day SMA) to gauge recent price behavior relative to its short-term trend.
  Sub-thought: Combine this distance with a longer-term moving average (e.g., 20-day SMA) to also consider where the price stands relative to its broader trend.
    Sub-thought: Evaluate the relationship between the shorter-term and longer-term moving averages, specifically if the shorter-term average is crossing above or below the longer-term one. This crossover point often indicates a shift in the underlying trend.
Thought: Examine the pattern of the high and low prices over the past several days (e.g., 10 days) to identify any significant gaps that might indicate unusual market activity or sentiment.
  Sub-thought: Calculate the average gap between the high and low for these days and compare it to the current day's gap. A significantly larger or smaller gap than usual might suggest a potential turning point or increased volatility.
Thought: Assess the cumulative amount traded over a period (e.g., 10 days) against the total trade value during the same period to derive an average price per unit traded. Compare this to the current day’s close to see if there's a notable deviation, possibly indicating under or overvaluation based on recent transaction levels.
  Sub-thought: Integrate the number of trades within the assessment; a higher frequency of trades at similar prices might imply a more established fair value, while infrequent, large trades could suggest a less stable valuation.
