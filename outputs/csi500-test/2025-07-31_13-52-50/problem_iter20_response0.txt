```python
import pandas as pd

def heuristics_v2(df):
    """
    This function calculates a novel alpha factor based on the provided DataFrame.
    The factor is a weighted combination of the following:
    - Price momentum: (close - open) / open
    - Volume-weighted price change: (close - open) * volume
    - Amount-weighted price change: (close - open) * amount
    - Volatility: (high - low) / close
    The weights are set to 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.3 respectively.
    
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame with columns (open, high, low, close, amount, volume).
    
    Returns:
    pd.Series: A Series with the calculated alpha factor.
