Synthesized Price and Intraday Momentum with Filtered Volume and Amount Shocks
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Sum of Logarithmic Returns (Close_t / Close_(t-1)) from t-6 to t-1
├── Apply Combined Volume and Amount Shock Filter
│   ├── Compute Absolute Volume Change (|Volume_t - Volume_(t-1)|)
│   ├── Compute Absolute Amount Change (|Amount_t - Amount_(t-1)|)
│   └── Keep only days with both Absolute Volume Change < 80th Percentile and
│       Absolute Amount Change < 80th Percentile
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Subtract Low Price from High Price
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Subtract Open Price from Close Price
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Moving Average of Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Multiply Intraday Volatility by Volume
│   └── Take Moving Average over 5 Days
└── Calculate Intraday Reversal Score
    ├── Divide Close-to-Open Return by Volume-Weighted Moving Average of Intraday Volatility
    └── Apply Exponential Decay with Half-life of 3 Days
