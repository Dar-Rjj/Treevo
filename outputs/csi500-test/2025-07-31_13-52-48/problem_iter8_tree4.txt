│   ├── Sum of Logarithmic Returns (Close_t / Close_(t-1))
│   └── Use Close price from t-5 to t-1
│       ├── Sum of Logarithmic Returns (Close_t / Close_(t-1))
├── Apply Volume Shock Filter
│   ├── Compute Absolute Volume Change (|Volume_t - Volume_(t-1)|)
│   └── Determine Threshold for High Volume Change
│       ├── Find 75th Percentile of Absolute Volume Changes
│       └── Set this as the threshold
│       └── Keep only days with Absolute Volume Change < 75th Percentile
