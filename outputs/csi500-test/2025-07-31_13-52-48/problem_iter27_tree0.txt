Thought: Explore Momentum Indicators as Alpha Factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate Price Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Use closing prices to calculate the price momentum over a lookback period
  - Code: `price_momentum = close_price / close_price.shift(lookback_period) - 1`
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Use volume data to calculate the volume momentum over a lookback period
  - Code: `volume_momentum = volume / volume.shift(lookback_period) - 1`
- Sub-thought: Calculate High-Low Range Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Use high and low prices to calculate the high-low range momentum over a lookback period
  - Code: `high_low_range_momentum = (high_price - low_price) / (high_price.shift(lookback_period) - low_price.shift(lookback_period)) - 1`

Thought: Explore Volatility Indicators as Alpha Factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate Historical Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Use log returns to calculate the historical volatility over a lookback period
  - Code: `log_returns = np.log(close_price / close_price.shift(1))` 
  - Code: `historical_volatility = np.sqrt(np.mean(log_returns.rolling(window=lookback_period).var()) * 252)`

Thought: Explore Market Sentiment Indicators as Alpha Factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate Money Flow Index (MFI)
  - Sub-thought: Use high, low, close, and volume data to calculate the MFI over a lookback period
  - Code: `typical_price = (high_price + low_price + close_price) / 3`
  - Code: `raw_money_flow = typical_price * volume`
  - Code: `positive_money_flow = raw_money_flow.where(typical_price > typical_price.shift(1), 0).rolling(window=lookback_period).sum()`
  - Code: `negative_money_flow = raw_money_flow.where(typical_price < typical_price.shift(1), 0).rolling(window=lookback_period).sum()`
  - Code: `money_flow_index = positive_money_flow / (positive_money_flow + negative_money_flow)`
- Sub-thought: Calculate Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)
  - Sub-thought: Use high, low, and close prices to calculate the A/D Line
  - Code: `money_flow_multiplier = ((close_price - low_price) - (high_price - close_price)) / (high_price - low_price)`
  - Code: `ad_line = (money_flow_multiplier * volume).cumsum()`

Thought: Explore Trend Indicators as Alpha Factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate Moving Averages
  - Sub-thought: Use closing prices to calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
  - Code: `short_term_ma = close_price.rolling(window=short_term_window).mean()`
  - Code: `long_term_ma = close_price.rolling(window=long_term_window).mean()`
- Sub-thought: Calculate Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Sub-thought: Use closing prices to calculate the MACD line and signal line
  - Code: `ema_short = close_price.ewm(span=short_ema_span, adjust=False).mean()`
  - Code: `ema_long = close_price.ewm(span=long_ema_span, adjust=False).mean()`
  - Code: `macd_line = ema_short - ema_long`
  - Code: `signal_line = macd_line.ewm(span=signal_span, adjust=False).mean()`
