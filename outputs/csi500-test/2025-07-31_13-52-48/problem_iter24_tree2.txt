- Calculate the Moving Averages to identify trends
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA) for short-term (e.g., 5 days)
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA) for long-term (e.g., 20 days)
  - Compute the difference between long-term and short-term SMA to gauge momentum
- Analyze Price Patterns for potential reversals or continuation
  - Look for Doji patterns in the close prices, indicating indecision and potential reversal
  - Identify Bullish Engulfing and Bearish Engulfing patterns using open, high, low, and close prices
- Calculate the Rate of Change (ROC) to measure the percentage change in price over a specific period
  - ROC for short-term (e.g., 5 days)
  - ROC for medium-term (e.g., 14 days)
  - Compare short-term and medium-term ROC to assess trend strength
- Examine Volume Patterns for signs of accumulation or distribution
  - Calculate the On-Balance Volume (OBV), which uses volume to predict changes in stock price
  - Observe OBV for divergence from price, indicating potential shifts in market sentiment
- Evaluate the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to determine overbought or oversold conditions
  - RSI for a standard period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Identify overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) levels
- Analyze the Bollinger Bands for volatility
  - Compute the 20-day simple moving average (middle band)
  - Calculate the upper and lower bands (2 standard deviations from the middle band)
  - Use the Bollinger Bands to identify periods of high or low volatility and potential breakouts
- Assess the Money Flow Index (MFI) to measure buying and selling pressure
  - MFI for a standard period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Determine if the MFI is above 80 (overbought) or below 20 (oversold)
- Incorporate the Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL) to confirm price trends
  - Calculate the ADL using high, low, and close prices
  - Observe if the ADL is confirming the price movement or showing divergence
- Evaluate the True Range (TR) to measure market volatility
  - Calculate the TR for each day
  - Compute the Average True Range (ATR) over a specified period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Use the ATR to set stop-loss levels and identify potential breakout opportunities
- Analyze the Elder Ray Index to identify the strength of bulls and bears
  - Calculate the Bull Power and Bear Power
  - Use the Elder Ray Index to gauge the strength of the current trend and potential reversals
- Examine the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) to measure the amount of money flow into and out of a security
  - CMF for a standard period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Interpret CMF to identify accumulation (positive values) or distribution (negative values)
- Implement the Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) to identify potential trend reversals
  - Calculate the SAR points
  - Use the SAR to set trailing stop-loss orders and identify entry and exit points
- Evaluate the Stochastic Oscillator to measure the position of the closing price relative to the high-low range
  - Stochastic Oscillator for a standard period (e.g., %K = 14, %D = 3)
  - Identify overbought (above 80) and oversold (below 20) conditions
- Assess the Donchian Channel to identify the highest and lowest prices over a specified period
  - Calculate the upper and lower Donchian Channels
  - Use the Donchian Channels to identify potential breakout opportunities
- Analyze the Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) to remove the trend from the price
  - DPO for a standard period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Use the DPO to identify cycles and potential turning points
- Evaluate the Kaufman Efficiency Ratio (KER) to measure the efficiency of price movement
  - KER for a standard period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Use the KER to identify efficient (high value) and inefficient (low value) trends
- Calculate the Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) to measure the difference between gains and losses
  - CMO for a standard period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Identify overbought (above 50) and oversold (below -50) conditions
- Analyze the Force Index (FI) to measure the force behind a price move
  - FI for a standard period (e.g., 13 days)
  - Use the FI to identify strong and weak price movements
