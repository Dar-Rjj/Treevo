[Factor Idea: Enhanced Momentum and Volatility Combination]
- [Primary Factor: Exponential Moving Average Crossover]
  - [Calculate a Short-Term EMA]
    - [Input: Close Prices of the past 5 days]
    - [Output: 5-day EMA]
  - [Calculate a Long-Term EMA]
    - [Input: Close Prices of the past 20 days]
    - [Output: 20-day EMA]
  - [Compute the Crossover Signal]
    - [Input: 5-day EMA, 20-day EMA]
    - [Output: EMA Crossover Signal (1 if 5-day EMA > 20-day EMA, 0 otherwise)]
- [Secondary Factor: Average True Range with Volatility Bands]
  - [Calculate the True Range for Each Day]
    - [Input: High, Low, Previous Close Prices]
    - [Output: True Ranges]
  - [Calculate the 14-Day ATR]
    - [Input: True Ranges of the past 14 days]
    - [Output: 14-day ATR]
  - [Define Upper and Lower Volatility Bands]
    - [Input: 14-day ATR, Multiplier (e.g., 2.0)]
    - [Output: Upper Band, Lower Band]
- [Tertiary Factor: Price Movement Within Volatility Bands]
  - [Determine Position Relative to Volatility Bands]
    - [Input: Current Close Price, Upper Band, Lower Band]
    - [Output: Position (1 if above Upper Band, 0 if within bands, -1 if below Lower Band)]
- [Combine Factors into a Composite Score]
  - [Inputs: EMA Crossover Signal, 14-day ATR, Position Relative to Volatility Bands]
  - [Composite Score Calculation]
    - [Condition 1: If EMA Crossover Signal is 1, 14-day ATR is high, and Position is 1, assign a very high score indicating strong momentum with high volatility and price breakout]
    - [Condition 2: If EMA Crossover Signal is 1, 14-day ATR is high, and Position is 0, assign a high score indicating strong momentum with high volatility but within bands]
    - [Condition 3: If EMA Crossover Signal is 1, 14-day ATR is low, and Position is 0, assign a moderate score indicating strong momentum with low volatility and within bands]
    - [Condition 4: If EMA Crossover Signal is 0, assign a low score regardless of ATR and Position, indicating no clear upward trend]
- [Output: Composite Factor Value]
  - [Representative of potential future returns based on combined momentum, volatility, and price position insights]
