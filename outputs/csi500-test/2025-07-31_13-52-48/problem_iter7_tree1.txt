Combined Price and Intraday Momentum with Volume Shock and Confirmation
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Sum of Logarithmic Returns (Close_t / Close_(t-1))
├── Apply Volume Shock Filter
│   ├── Compute Absolute Volume Change (|Volume_t - Volume_(t-1)|)
│   └── Keep only days with Absolute Volume Change < 75th Percentile
├── Calculate Intraday Price Movement
│   ├── Calculate Percentage Price Movement (High - Low) / Open
│   ├── Calculate Percentage Price Movement (Close - Open) / Open
│   └── Average the Two Percentage Movements
├── Smooth the Average using a 3-day Exponential Moving Average
└── Weighted Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Use Smoothed Price Movement
    └── Multiply by Volume Change Percentage (Current - Previous) / Previous
