Thought: Integrated Momentum, Volatility, and Volume Factors
├── Calculate Intraday Price Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Ratio
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Use Open price
│       └── Divide Close by Open
├── Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Use Close-to-Open Ratio
│   └── Use Intraday Price Range
│       └── Combine both values using a weighted average
├── Interact Intraday Volatility with Volume
│   ├── Use Intraday Volatility
│   └── Use Volume
│       └── Multiply both values
├── Calculate Simple Moving Averages
│   ├── Use close prices to derive the 5-day, 20-day, and 50-day simple moving averages
│   └── Compute the difference between shorter and longer period moving averages (e.g., 5-day - 20-day)
├── Examine Price Changes
│   ├── Calculate the percentage change in close price from the previous day
│   └── Sum the daily percentage changes over the past 5 days
├── Incorporate Volume
│   ├── Calculate the average trading volume over the last 20 days
│   └── Determine the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the last 20 days
├── Integrate Amount
│   ├── Compute the total transaction amount over the last 20 days
│   └── Compare today's transaction amount with the 20-day average
├── Investigate Volatility
│   ├── Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over the past 20 days
│   └── Assess the average true range over the past 14 days
└── Analyze High and Low Prices
    ├── Calculate the average of daily high and low prices over the past 20 days
    └── Compute the difference between the highest high and lowest low over the past 20 days
