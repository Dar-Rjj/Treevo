Synthesized Price and Intraday Momentum with Adjusted Volume-Weighted Momentum and Filtered Shocks
├── Calculate Combined Momentum
│   ├── Sum of Logarithmic Returns (Close_t / Close_(t-1)) from t-5 to t-1
│   └── Multiply by 20-Day Rolling Sum of Volume-Weighted Momentum
├── Apply Combined Volume and Amount Shock Filter
│   ├── Compute Absolute Volume Change (|Volume_t - Volume_(t-1)|)
│   ├── Compute Absolute Amount Change (|Amount_t - Amount_(t-1)|)
│   └── Keep only days with both Absolute Volume Change < 75th Percentile and
│       Absolute Amount Change < 75th Percentile
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Subtract Low Price from High Price
├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Subtract Open Price from Close Price
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Moving Average of Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Multiply Intraday Volatility by Volume
│   └── Take Moving Average over 10 Days
├── Calculate Intraday Reversal Score
│   ├── Divide Close-to-Open Return by Volume-Weighted Moving Average of Intraday Volatility
│   └── Apply Exponential Decay with Half-life of 3 Days
├── Adjust Combined Momentum by Daily Price Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close from Current Close
│   ├── Calculate Daily Price Volatility
│   │   └── Compute Standard Deviation of Daily Price Changes over the Last 20 Days
│   └── Divide Combined Momentum by Daily Price Volatility
└── Calculate Momentum Difference
    ├── Subtract 60-Day Moving Average of Adjusted Combined Momentum from 20-Day Adjusted Combined Momentum
└── Introduce Price Trend Indicator
    ├── Calculate 50-Day Simple Moving Average of Close Prices
    └── Compare Current Close Price to 50-Day SMA
        ├── If Current Close > 50-Day SMA, assign 1
        └── If Current Close <= 50-Day SMA, assign -1
