[Factor Idea: Momentum and Volatility Combination]
- [Primary Factor: Simple Moving Average Crossover]
  - [Calculate a Short-Term SMA]
    - [Input: Close Prices of the past 5 days]
    - [Output: 5-day SMA]
  - [Calculate a Long-Term SMA]
    - [Input: Close Prices of the past 20 days]
    - [Output: 20-day SMA]
  - [Compute the Crossover Signal]
    - [Input: 5-day SMA, 20-day SMA]
    - [Output: SMA Crossover Signal (1 if 5-day SMA > 20-day SMA, 0 otherwise)]
- [Secondary Factor: Average True Range Overlook]
  - [Calculate the True Range for Each Day]
    - [Input: High, Low, Previous Close Prices]
    - [Output: True Ranges]
  - [Calculate the 14-Day ATR]
    - [Input: True Ranges of the past 14 days]
    - [Output: 14-day ATR]
- [Combine Factors into a Composite Score]
  - [Inputs: SMA Crossover Signal, 14-day ATR]
  - [Composite Score Calculation]
    - [Condition 1: If SMA Crossover Signal is 1 and 14-day ATR is high, assign a high score indicating strong momentum with sufficient volatility]
    - [Condition 2: If SMA Crossover Signal is 1 but 14-day ATR is low, assign a moderate score indicating strong momentum but low volatility]
    - [Condition 3: If SMA Crossover Signal is 0, assign a low score regardless of ATR, indicating no clear upward trend]
- [Output: Composite Factor Value]
  - [Representative of potential future returns based on combined momentum and volatility insights]
