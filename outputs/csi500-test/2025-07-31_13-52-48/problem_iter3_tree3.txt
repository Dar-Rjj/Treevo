Price Momentum with Volume and Amount Shock Filter
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price from t-5 to t-1
│   │   ├── Sum of Logarithmic Returns (Close_t / Close_(t-1))
│   └── Normalize by Days (not allowed, so just Sum)
└── Apply Combined Volume and Amount Shock Filter
    ├── Calculate Daily Volume Change
    │   ├── Use Volume at t and t-1
    │   └── Compute Absolute Volume Change (|Volume_t - Volume_(t-1)|)
    ├── Calculate Daily Amount Change
    │   ├── Use Amount at t and t-1
    │   └── Compute Absolute Amount Change (|Amount_t - Amount_(t-1)|)
    └── Filter High Volume and Amount Shocks
        ├── Determine Thresholds for High Volume and Amount Changes
        │   ├── Find 75th Percentile of Absolute Volume Changes
        │   ├── Find 75th Percentile of Absolute Amount Changes
        │   └── Set these as the thresholds
        └── Keep only days with both Absolute Volume Change < Volume Threshold and
            Absolute Amount Change < Amount Threshold
