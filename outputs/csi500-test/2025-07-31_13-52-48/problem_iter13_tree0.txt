├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Sum of Logarithmic Returns (Close_t / Close_(t-1)) for t-5 to t-1
├── Apply Volume Shock Filter
│   ├── Compute Absolute Volume Change (|Volume_t - Volume_(t-1)|)
│   └── Set 75th Percentile as Threshold
│       └── Keep days with Absolute Volume Change < 75th Percentile
├── Calculate Intraday Price Movement
