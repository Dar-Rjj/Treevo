Enhanced Multi-Period Momentum with Dynamic Volatility, Trend Strength, and Price Action
├── Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Collect Closing prices for the last 10 days
│   └── Subtract the current Close price from the 10-day average
├── Calculate Medium-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Collect Closing prices for the last 30 days
│   └── Subtract the current Close price from the 30-day average
├── Calculate Long-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Collect Closing prices for the last 50 days
│   └── Subtract the current Close price from the 50-day average
├── Combine Multi-Period Momenta
│   ├── Add the Short-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Add the Medium-Term Price Momentum
│   └── Add the Long-Term Price Momentum
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Return
│   ├── Compute daily returns using Close and Open prices
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Use Open price
│   ├── Multiply each daily return by the respective volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Sum the volume-weighted returns
│   └── Divide by the total volume over the period
├── Adjust Combined Momentum by Volume-Weighted Average Return
│   └── Multiply the combined momentum by the Volume-Weighted Average Return
├── Assess Trend Following Potential
│   ├── Evaluate Long-Term Direction
│   │   ├── Calculate 50-day Moving Average of Close prices
│   │   └── Use Last 50 Close prices
│   └── Apply Weight to Trend Following Component
│       ├── If 50-day Moving Average is above the current Close price, assign weight 1
│       └── Otherwise, assign weight 0.5
├── Determine Intermediate Factor Value
│   └── Add the adjusted combined momentum to the trend following component
├── Calculate Short-Term Volatility
│   ├── Collect High and Low prices for the last 10 days
│   └── Compute the average of the last 10 days' range (High - Low)
├── Calculate Medium-Term Volatility
│   ├── Collect High and Low prices for the last 30 days
│   └── Compute the average of the last 30 days' range (High - Low)
├── Calculate Long-Term Volatility
│   ├── Collect High and Low prices for the last 50 days
│   └── Compute the average of the last 50 days' range (High - Low)
├── Combine Multi-Period Volatilities
│   ├── Add the Short-Term Volatility
│   ├── Add the Medium-Term Volatility
│   └── Add the Long-Term Volatility
├── Adjust Combined Momentum by Combined Volatility
│   └── Divide the intermediate factor value by the combined volatility
├── Calculate Price Action Strength
│   ├── Compute the difference between the highest High and lowest Low in the last 10 days
│   └── Normalize by dividing by the 10-day average range (High - Low)
├── Integrate Price Action Strength into Final Factor
│   └── Multiply the result of the adjusted combined momentum divided by the combined volatility by the Price Action Strength
├── Calculate Dynamic Volatility Adjustment
│   ├── Compute the standard deviation of daily returns for the last 20 days
│   └── Adjust the final factor value by this dynamic volatility
└── Determine Final Factor Value
    └── Result of the integration of the adjusted combined momentum, combined volatility, and price action strength, further adjusted by dynamic volatility
