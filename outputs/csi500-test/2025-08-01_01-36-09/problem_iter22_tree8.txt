Alpha Factor Generation Thought Tree
- Adaptive Volatility
  - Calculate historical volatility using standard deviation of log returns
    - Use a rolling window to update volatility dynamically
  - Incorporate adaptive weights based on recent market conditions
    - Adjust weights using a moving average of recent returns
- Dynamic Trend Following
  - Identify short-term and long-term trends using moving averages
    - Short-term: 10-day moving average
    - Long-term: 50-day moving average
  - Calculate the trend strength by comparing the distance between moving averages
    - Use the difference between long-term and short-term moving averages
  - Apply a momentum-based filter to confirm the trend
    - Use a simple momentum indicator (e.g., ROC) to validate the trend
- Volume-Adjusted Momentum
  - Calculate price momentum using the rate of change (ROC)
    - Use a 10-day ROC for short-term momentum
  - Adjust the momentum by incorporating volume
    - Multiply ROC by the ratio of current volume to average volume
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Compute RSI using the 14-day period
  - Use RSI to identify overbought and oversold conditions
    - Overbought: RSI > 70
    - Oversold: RSI < 30
  - Combine RSI with other factors for a more robust signal
    - Use RSI as a secondary filter to confirm signals from other factors
- Sentiment Analysis
  - Use sentiment scores from news or social media
    - Calculate an aggregated sentiment score for a given stock
  - Incorporate sentiment into the alpha factor
    - Add sentiment score as a multiplicative factor to the overall alpha score
- Macroeconomic Data
  - Integrate key macroeconomic indicators
    - Examples: GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, inflation rate
  - Use macroeconomic data to adjust the weight of other factors
    - Example: Increase the weight of trend following in a strong economy
- Machine Learning for Weight Adjustments
  - Train a model to predict future returns based on the generated alpha factors
    - Use a supervised learning approach with historical data
  - Adjust the weights of each factor based on the model's predictions
    - Example: Increase the weight of adaptive volatility if the model predicts higher future returns
- Sector-Specific Indicators
  - Incorporate sector-specific metrics
    - Example: For technology, use R&D expenditure as a factor
  - Adjust the alpha factor based on sector-specific indicators
    - Example: Add a sector-specific bonus or penalty to the overall alpha score
- Final Alpha Factor Calculation
  - Combine all the adjusted factors
    - Sum the weighted values of adaptive volatility, dynamic trend following, volume-adjusted momentum, RSI, sentiment analysis, and sector-specific indicators
  - Normalize the final combined factor (if necessary, but not allowed in this task)
  - Use the final alpha factor to predict future stock returns
