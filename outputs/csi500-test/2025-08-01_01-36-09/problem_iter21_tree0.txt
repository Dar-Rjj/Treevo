- Combine Adaptive Volatility and Dynamic Trend Following
  - Calculate Rolling Standard Deviation (Volatility)
    - Use High, Low, and Close Prices
    - Window Size: 20 Days
  - Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    - Use Close Price
    - Periods: 10, 50
  - Define Trend Strength
    - Difference Between 10-Period and 50-Period EMA
  - Integrate Volatility and Trend
    - Normalize Trend Strength by Volatility
    - Create a Composite Trend-Volatility Factor

- Volume-Adjusted Momentum
  - Calculate Price Momentum
    - Use Close Price
    - Lookback: 20 Days
  - Adjust Momentum by Volume
    - Multiply Momentum by Average Volume over 20 Days
  - Create Volume-Adjusted Momentum Factor

- Sentiment Analysis
  - Use RSI (Relative Strength Index)
    - Period: 14 Days
  - Define Sentiment
    - High RSI (>70): Bullish
    - Low RSI (<30): Bearish
    - Neutral RSI (30-70): Neutral
  - Create Sentiment-Based Factor
    - Score: +1 for Bullish, -1 for Bearish, 0 for Neutral

- Macroeconomic Data
  - Use Interest Rates
    - Monthly Data
  - Use Inflation Rates
    - Monthly Data
  - Calculate Economic Indicator
    - Difference Between Current and Previous Month
  - Create Macroeconomic-Based Factor
    - Positive Change: +1
    - Negative Change: -1
    - No Change: 0

- Machine Learning for Weight Adjustments

    - Features: Composite Trend-Volatility, Volume-Adjusted Momentum, Sentiment, Macroeconomic
    - Target: Future Returns (e.g., 1-Month Ahead)
  - Use Model Predictions as Weights
    - Apply Weights to Each Factor
    - Sum of Weighted Factors

- Sector-Specific Indicators
  - Identify Sectors
    - Use Industry Classification
  - Calculate Sector Performance
    - Use Close Price
    - Lookback: 20 Days
  - Create Sector-Specific Momentum
    - Average Momentum of Stocks in the Same Sector
  - Incorporate Sector-Specific Momentum
