Volume and Price Momentum Factor (VPMF)
├── Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   │   ├── Get the last 14 days' closing prices
│   │   └── Calculate the difference between today's close and the close 14 days ago
│   └── Smooth the Difference
│       ├── Apply a 7-day Simple Moving Average to the differences
│       └── Output: short-term smoothed momentum
├── Incorporate Volume Dynamics
│   ├── Get the last 14 days' volume
│   └── Calculate Volume Variability
│       ├── Find the standard deviation of the volumes over the last 14 days
│       └── Output: volume variability
└── Combine Short-Term Momentum and Volume
    ├── Multiply short-term smoothed momentum by volume variability
    └── Output: VPMF
        ├── This factor combines short-term price momentum with volume changes, potentially
        └── enhancing the predictive power for future returns by considering both recent price
            and volume dynamics.
