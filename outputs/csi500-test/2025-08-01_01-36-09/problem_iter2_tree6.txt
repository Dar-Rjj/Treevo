Improved Momentum and Volatility Based Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Daily Return
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close Price
│   └── Divide by Previous Day's Close Price
├── Calculate Smoothed Momentum
│   ├── Aggregate Daily Returns Over a Window (e.g., 20 days)
│   │   ├── Sum of Daily Returns
│   │   └── Subtract the Minimum Daily Return in the Window
│   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average to the Adjusted Sum
└── Incorporate Relative Volatility
    ├── Calculate True Range
    │   ├── Use High, Low, and Previous Day's Close prices
    │   └── Compute the Maximum of (High - Low), (High - Previous Close), (Low - Previous Close)
    ├── Aggregate True Range Over a Window (e.g., 20 days)
    │   ├── Sum of True Ranges
    │   └── Divide by the Number of Days in the Window
    └── Combine Momentum and Volatility
        ├── Divide Smoothed Momentum by Aggregated Volatility
        └── Subtract the Long-Term Exponential Moving Average of the Result
