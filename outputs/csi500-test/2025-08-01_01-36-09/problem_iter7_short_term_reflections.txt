Integrate momentum, volume, and trend with dynamic weights; focus on recent data for quicker trend adjustments.
Incorporate volatility, incorporate trade volume directly into momentum, and refine trend assessment with more dynamic weights.
Incorporate more periods, use moving averages, and integrate volume-weighted returns for enhanced trend following.
Integrate volatility, incorporate market sentiment, and refine trend following with adaptive weights.
Simplify momentum periods, integrate volume early, and focus on long-term trends for stability.
Incorporate more periods, use exponential weighting, and consider price volatility and market sentiment.
Incorporate more periods, use adjusted closes, and consider volume-weighted returns for better trend following.
Incorporate volatility, use exponential moving averages, and consider market sentiment for improved factor robustness.
