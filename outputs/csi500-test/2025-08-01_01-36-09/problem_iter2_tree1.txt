High-Low Volatility Adjusted Momentum with Trend Consideration
├── Calculate Daily High-Low Price Difference
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Subtract Low price
├── Compute 20-Day Sum of High-Low Differences
│   ├── Aggregate Daily High-Low Differences over 20 days
│   └── Store the sum as a volatility measure
├── Calculate 20-Day Close Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price on the current day (t)
│   └── Subtract Close price from 20 days ago (t-20)
├── Adjust Momentum by Volatility
│   ├── Take the 20-Day Sum of High-Low Differences
│   └── Divide 20-Day Close Price Momentum by the Volatility Measure
├── Evaluate Long-Term Direction
│   ├── Calculate 50-day Moving Average of Close prices
│   │   ├── Sum of Close prices over the last 50 days
│   │   └── Divide by 50
│   └── Compare Current Close to 50-day Moving Average
│       ├── If Current Close > 50-day MA, assign 1
│       └── If Current Close <= 50-day MA, assign 0
└── Determine Final Factor Value
    ├── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Long-Term Direction
    └── Add a Bias Term (e.g., 0.5) for Smoothing
