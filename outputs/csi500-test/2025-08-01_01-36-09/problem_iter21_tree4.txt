- Adaptive Volatility and Momentum Factors
  - Calculate Historical Volatility
    - Use a rolling window to compute the standard deviation of daily returns
  - Calculate Average True Range (ATR)
    - Use a rolling window to compute the ATR
  - Combine Volatility Measures
    - Create a composite volatility factor by averaging historical volatility and ATR
  - Calculate Momentum
    - Use a rolling window to compute the simple moving average of returns
  - Volume-Adjusted Momentum
    - Multiply the momentum by the ratio of current volume to the average volume over the same period

- Dynamic Trend Following Factors
  - Moving Averages Crossover
    - Compute short-term and long-term moving averages
    - Generate a binary signal (1 if short-term > long-term, 0 otherwise)
  - Exponential Moving Averages Crossover
    - Compute short-term and long-term exponential moving averages
    - Generate a binary signal (1 if short-term > long-term, 0 otherwise)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
    - Compute the MACD line and signal line
    - Generate a binary signal (1 if MACD line > signal line, 0 otherwise)

- Sentiment and Macroeconomic Factors
  - Sentiment Analysis
    - Use a sentiment score derived from news articles or social media
    - Normalize the sentiment score to a range (e.g., -1 to 1) for interpretability
  - Macroeconomic Indicators
    - Include indicators like GDP growth rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate
    - Use a rolling window to compute the changes in these indicators

- Machine Learning for Weight Adjustments
  - Feature Engineering
    - Combine all the above factors into a feature set
  - Model Training
    - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) on the feature set
  - Weight Adjustment
    - Use the model to predict future returns and adjust the weights of the factors accordingly

- Sector-Specific Indicators
  - Identify Key Sectors
    - Segment the market into key sectors (e.g., technology, healthcare, finance)
  - Sector Performance
    - Calculate the relative performance of each sector
  - Sector Momentum
    - Compute the momentum of each sector
  - Sector Volatility
    - Calculate the historical volatility of each sector
  - Sector-Specific Factor
    - Create a composite factor that combines sector performance, momentum, and volatility
