Incorporate volume-weighted returns, combine short and long-term momentum, and use trend-following signals for enhanced alpha.
Integrate multi-period momentum, volume-weighted returns, and trend-following for robust factor generation.
Incorporate volatility, use dynamic periods, and integrate market sentiment for improved heuristics.
Incorporate both price and volume dynamics, apply smoothing, and consider shorter time frames for more responsive factors.
Incorporate volume, blend short and long-term momentum, and align with long-term trend for improved factor performance.
Integrate multiple time frames, use volume-weighted returns, and consider long-term trends for enhanced predictive factors.
Incorporate more dynamic volume measures and smoother momentum calculations for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate multi-period momentum, volume-weighted returns, and trend following for robust, interpretable alpha factors.
Incorporate both short and long-term momentum, use volume-weighted returns, and consider trend following for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use volatility for adjustment, and focus on high-low price differences for robustness.
