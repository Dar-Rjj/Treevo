- Integrate adaptive volatility, dynamic trend following, and volume-adjusted momentum
  - Adaptive Volatility
    - Calculate rolling standard deviation of daily returns
      - Use a rolling window (e.g., 20 days)
      - Weight recent data more heavily using exponential smoothing
  - Dynamic Trend Following
    - Calculate moving average crossover signals
      - Short-term moving average (e.g., 50-day) and long-term moving average (e.g., 200-day)
      - Generate buy/sell signals based on crossovers
    - Incorporate momentum
      - Calculate the rate of change (ROC) over a specified period (e.g., 14 days)
      - Use ROC to confirm the trend direction
  - Volume-Adjusted Momentum
    - Calculate the money flow index (MFI)
      - Use typical price (average of high, low, close)
      - Consider volume and price changes
      - Generate MFI with a rolling window (e.g., 14 days)
    - Adjust momentum with volume
      - Multiply momentum by the volume ratio (current volume / average volume over a period)
- Use RSI, sentiment, and macroeconomic data
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Calculate RSI over a specified period (e.g., 14 days)
    - Use RSI to identify overbought and oversold conditions
  - Sentiment Analysis
    - Use external sentiment scores (e.g., from news, social media)
    - Map sentiment scores to a scale that can be used as an alpha factor
  - Macroeconomic Data
    - Incorporate key macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, inflation rates)
    - Map these indicators to a scale that can be used as an alpha factor
- Apply machine learning for weight adjustments
  - Feature Engineering
    - Combine the above factors into a feature set
    - Create a dataset with historical factor values and corresponding future returns
  - Model Selection
    - Choose a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting)
    - Train the model on historical data to predict future returns
  - Weight Adjustment
    - Use the trained model to generate weights for each factor
    - Adjust the weights dynamically based on the model's predictions
- Incorporate sector-specific indicators for robust, interpretable alpha factors
  - Sector-Specific Indicators
    - Identify key indicators for each sector (e.g., P/E ratio for technology, oil prices for energy)
    - Calculate these indicators and include them in the feature set
  - Robustness and Interpretability
    - Ensure that the indicators are robust and provide clear interpretability
    - Use domain knowledge to validate the relevance of the indicators
