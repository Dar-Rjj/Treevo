Alpha Factor Generation Thought Tree
- Advanced Statistical Methods
  - GARCH Model for Volatility
    - Estimate time-varying volatility using GARCH(1,1) model
      - Use log returns to calculate conditional variance
  - ARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting
    - Fit an ARIMA model to the log returns
      - Use AIC and BIC to select the best model parameters
- Refined Trend and Momentum Indicators
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover
    - Calculate short-term and long-term EMAs
      - Short-term: 12-day EMA
      - Long-term: 26-day EMA
    - Determine trend direction by comparing EMAs
      - Bullish: Short-term EMA > Long-term EMA
      - Bearish: Short-term EMA < Long-term EMA
  - TEMA (Triple Exponential Moving Average)
    - Calculate TEMA for smoother trend identification
      - Use a 30-day period for TEMA
  - Rate of Change (ROC) with Volume Adjustment
    - Calculate 10-day ROC
    - Adjust ROC by multiplying with volume ratio
      - Volume ratio = Current volume / 50-day average volume
- Sentiment Analysis
  - Real-Time Sentiment Scores
    - Aggregate sentiment scores from news and social media
    - Normalize sentiment scores (scale from -1 to 1)
  - Integrate Sentiment into Alpha Factor
    - Add sentiment score to the overall alpha factor
      - Example: alpha_factor = alpha_factor + sentiment_score
- Macroeconomic Data
  - Key Macroeconomic Indicators
    - GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, inflation rate
    - Use real-time data updates
  - Adjust Alpha Factors Based on Macroeconomic Conditions
    - Example: Increase weight of momentum factors in a strong economy
- Sector-Specific Indicators
  - Incorporate Relevant Sector Metrics
    - Technology: R&D expenditure
    - Financials: Dividend yield and P/E ratio
    - Energy: Crude oil prices
  - Adjust Alpha Factor Based on Sector-Specific Indicators
    - Example: Add a sector-specific bonus or penalty to the overall alpha score
