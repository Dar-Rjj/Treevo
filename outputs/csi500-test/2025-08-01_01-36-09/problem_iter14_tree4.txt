Enhanced Multi-Period Momentum with Volume and Volatility Adjustments
├── Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Collect Closing prices for the last 10 days
│   └── Compute the difference between current Close and 10-day average
├── Calculate Medium-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Collect Closing prices for the last 30 days
│   └── Compute the difference between current Close and 30-day average
├── Combine Short-Term and Medium-Term Momenta
│   ├── Add the Short-Term Price Momentum
│   └── Add the Medium-Term Price Momentum
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Return
│   ├── Compute daily returns using (Close - Open) / Open
│   ├── Multiply each daily return by the respective volume
│   ├── Sum the volume-weighted returns
│   └── Divide by the total volume over the period
├── Adjust Combined Momentum by Volume-Weighted Average Return
│   └── Multiply the combined momentum by the Volume-Weighted Average Return
├── Assess Trend Following Potential
│   ├── Evaluate Long-Term Direction
│   │   ├── Calculate 50-day Moving Average of Close prices
│   │   └── Use Last 50 Close prices
│   └── Apply Weight to Trend Following Component
│       ├── If 50-day Moving Average is above the current Close price, assign weight 1
│       └── Otherwise, assign weight 0.5
├── Calculate Short-Term Volatility
│   ├── Collect High and Low prices for the last 10 days
│   └── Compute the average of the last 10 days' range (High - Low)
├── Calculate Medium-Term Volatility
│   ├── Collect High and Low prices for the last 30 days
│   └── Compute the average of the last 30 days' range (High - Low)
├── Combine Short-Term and Medium-Term Volatilities
│   ├── Add the Short-Term Volatility
│   └── Add the Medium-Term Volatility
├── Adjust Combined Momentum by Combined Volatility
│   └── Divide the adjusted combined momentum by the combined volatility
└── Determine Final Factor Value
    └── Add the new adjusted combined momentum to the trend following component
        This factor integrates multi-period momentum, volume-weighted returns, and volatility adjustments,
        potentially enhancing the predictive power for future returns.
