Enhanced Multi-Period Momentum with Adaptive Volatility and Volume Adjustments
├── Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Collect Closing prices for the last 10 days
│   └── Compute the difference between current Close and 10-day average
├── Calculate Medium-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Collect Closing prices for the last 30 days
│   └── Compute the difference between current Close and 30-day average
├── Calculate Long-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Collect Closing prices for the last 50 days
│   └── Compute the difference between current Close and 50-day average
├── Combine Multi-Period Momenta
│   ├── Add the Short-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Add the Medium-Term Price Momentum
│   └── Add the Long-Term Price Momentum
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Return
│   ├── Compute daily returns using (Close - Open) / Open
│   ├── Multiply each daily return by the respective volume
│   ├── Sum the volume-weighted returns
│   └── Divide by the total volume over the period
├── Adjust Combined Momentum by Volume-Weighted Average Return
│   └── Multiply the combined momentum by the Volume-Weighted Average Return
├── Assess Trend Following Potential
│   ├── Evaluate Long-Term Direction
│   │   ├── Calculate 50-day Moving Average of Close prices
│   │   └── Use Last 50 Close prices
│   └── Apply Adaptive Weight to Trend Following Component
│       ├── If 50-day Moving Average is above the current Close price, assign weight 1
│       └── Otherwise, assign a weight based on the distance from the 50-day Moving Average
├── Calculate Short-Term Volatility
│   ├── Collect High and Low prices for the last 10 days
│   └── Compute the average of the last 10 days' range (High - Low)
├── Calculate Medium-Term Volatility
│   ├── Collect High and Low prices for the last 30 days
│   └── Compute the average of the last 30 days' range (High - Low)
├── Calculate Long-Term Volatility
│   ├── Collect High and Low prices for the last 50 days
│   └── Compute the average of the last 50 days' range (High - Low)
├── Combine Multi-Period Volatilities
│   ├── Add the Short-Term Volatility
│   ├── Add the Medium-Term Volatility
│   └── Add the Long-Term Volatility
├── Adjust Combined Momentum by Combined Volatility
│   └── Divide the adjusted combined momentum by the combined volatility
├── Integrate Market Signals and RSI
│   ├── Calculate RSI for the last 14 days
│   │   └── Use Close prices
│   │   └── Compute RSI
│   ├── Adjust Final Factor Value by RSI
│   │   ├── If RSI > 70, apply a negative adjustment
│   │   └── If RSI < 30, apply a positive adjustment
├── Incorporate Microstructure
│   ├── Calculate Spread (High - Low) for the last 10 days
│   └── Adjust Final Factor Value by Spread
│       ├── If Spread is high, reduce the factor value
│       └── If Spread is low, increase the factor value
├── Determine Final Factor Value
│   └── Combine all components: Adjusted Combined Momentum, Trend Following, and Microstructure
└── Finalize Factor
    └── The final factor value is the result after combining all the components
        This factor integrates multi-period momentum, dynamic volume and volatility adjustments,
        adaptive trend following, RSI, and microstructure, potentially enhancing the predictive power for future returns.
