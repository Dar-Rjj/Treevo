Incorporate longer-term trends, liquidity, and volatility. Normalize and combine factors thoughtfully.
Incorporate mean reversion, use adaptive windows, and include volume-weighted indicators for enhanced signals.
Incorporate momentum, volatility normalization, and liquidity with longer-term trends for enhanced alpha factor stability and predictive power.
Incorporate momentum, volume, and volatility with adaptive time frames for more dynamic factor generation.
Incorporate momentum, adjust volatility normalization, and refine moving averages for sharper trend detection.
Integrate volume trends, consider momentum, and explore weighted moving averages for smoother trends.
Incorporate more market dynamics, use advanced statistical normalization, and smooth factors for better stability and predictive power.
Incorporate volatility, liquidity, and trend strength; normalize differences; use longer-term moving averages for stability.
Incorporate relative strength, moving average crossovers, and normalize by price range for stability.
Incorporate momentum, use relative ratios for trends, and consider volume changes for liquidity.
