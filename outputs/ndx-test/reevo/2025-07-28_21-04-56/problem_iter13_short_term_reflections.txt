Simplify, focus on key indicators, avoid over-combining, and use appropriate smoothing.
Opt for EWM over SMA, reduce noise with fewer components, normalize factors, and apply smoothing.
Use exponential smoothing, consider additional indicators, and incorporate market sentiment for improved heuristics.
Incorporate more dynamic volatility measures and refine normalization in factor combination.
Incorporate diverse timeframes, use exponential smoothing, and balance components for stability and responsiveness.
Incorporate more diverse indicators, use EWM for smoothing, and balance components in the alpha factor.
Incorporate adaptive windows, use more relevant price and volume transformations, and combine factors multiplicatively for enhanced signal.
Incorporate more diverse volatility measures and trend indicators, optimize smoothing.
Simplify, use shorter windows, and focus on key indicators for clearer, more responsive signals.
Incorporate more sophisticated technical indicators and use exponential smoothing for dynamic market adaptation.
