Use shorter windows, focus on recent trends, and balance simplicity with feature integration for clarity and effectiveness.
Incorporate more sophisticated volatility measures and use exponential smoothing for dynamic market adaptability.
Incorporate more robust statistical measures and use shorter smoothing windows for quicker adaptation.
Focus on volatility, trend strength, and momentum. Simplify factor combinations and use exponential smoothing for better responsiveness.
Incorporate more dynamic and diverse indicators, and adjust smoothing for responsiveness.
Incorporate macroeconomic data, use machine learning for feature selection, and experiment with different time frames for momentum.
Incorporate more diverse indicators, weight them dynamically, and use machine learning for adaptive factor combination.
Incorporate more sophisticated indicators, like Bollinger Bands, and refine the normalization of combined factors.
Shorter periods, simpler calculations, and volume normalization can improve factor responsiveness and interpretability.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use more diverse volatility measures, and integrate macroeconomic indicators for better heuristics.
