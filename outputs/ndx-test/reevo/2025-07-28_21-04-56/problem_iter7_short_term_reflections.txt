Incorporate RSI, moving average crossovers, and consider adding MACD for trend and momentum signals.
Incorporate more sophisticated volatility measures, use diverse time frames, and apply smoothing techniques for robustness.
Incorporate more dynamic metrics, use exponential smoothing, and consider volume-weighted indicators for enhanced factor stability.
Consider shorter time frames, normalize data, and integrate multiple factors like volatility, liquidity, and trend strength.
Incorporate more dynamic measures, use exponential smoothing, and consider price/volume ratios for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Integrate more technical indicators, consider market regimes, and use machine learning for dynamic factor weighting.
Incorporate more dynamic price and volume measures, use shorter windows, and smooth for noise reduction.
Incorporate relative strength, use normalized indicators, and apply smoothing for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate more dynamic measures, use shorter windows, and consider additional market indicators for enhanced factor robustness.
