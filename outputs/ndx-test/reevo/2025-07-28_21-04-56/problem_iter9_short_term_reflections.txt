Shorter lookback, simpler volatility, and inclusion of open-close range improve factor performance.
Use shorter time frames, simplify calculations, and focus on key factors like momentum, volatility, and liquidity.
Consider shorter time frames, simpler moving averages, and direct volume ratios for more responsive and interpretable factors.
Incorporate more sophisticated indicators, use adaptive windows, and consider market regime changes for dynamic factor adjustments.
Incorporate relative strength, seasonality, and sentiment; use longer-term moving averages for trend strength.
Incorporate more diverse indicators, use exponential smoothing, and weigh by volume for better signal-to-noise.
Incorporate more dynamic price and volume interactions, use exponential smoothing, and normalize factors.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use volume-weighted metrics, and integrate sentiment and seasonality for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate more nuanced volatility measures, use adaptive windows, and integrate market breadth indicators.
