Incorporate liquidity, use shorter momentum, integrate sentiment, and balance with long-term trends for improved heuristics.
Incorporate sector performance, use shorter momentum periods, and include money flow for liquidity insights.
Incorporate sector-specific metrics, use MFI, and apply exponential smoothing for more robust and interpretable alpha factors.
Incorporate more technical indicators, consider sector effects, and use exponential smoothing for robustness.
Incorporate more dynamic indicators, reduce lookback periods, and weigh factors by their predictive power.
Integrate diverse indicators, apply sector adjustments, and use exponential smoothing for more robust and adaptive factors.
Incorporate volatility, moving averages, and additional lags for richer signals.
Incorporate sector, liquidity, and market cap; use adaptive windows; consider macroeconomic indicators.
Incorporate sector trends, refine weighting, and consider additional technical indicators for improved factor robustness.
Incorporate volume, use shorter momentum windows, and consider interactions between price and volume changes.
