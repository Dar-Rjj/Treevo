Incorporate more diverse indicators, use dynamic weighting, and balance short-term signals with long-term trends.
Consider dynamic weights, non-linear combinations, and additional technical indicators for enhanced factor robustness.
Integrate lagged interactions, use shorter windows, and combine with adaptive weights for more dynamic factor adjustments.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use adaptive weighting, and include market sentiment or external data for enhancement.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and avoid over-combining factors for clearer, more interpretable signals.
Incorporate dynamic market conditions, use adaptive windows, and consider sector rotation for enhanced factor robustness.
Incorporate macroeconomic data, use machine learning for factor synthesis, and optimize parameters regularly.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and consider their interactions. Avoid overfitting with too many factors.
Adjust weights, extend lookback periods, and incorporate interaction terms for enhanced predictive power.
Optimize window sizes, balance factor weights, and consider adaptive weighting for improved performance.
