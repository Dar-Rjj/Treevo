Consider dynamic weights, regime detection, and advanced signal processing for more robust factors.
Incorporate non-linear transformations and integrate fewer, more robust indicators.
Incorporate longer-term trends, cross-asset correlations, and sentiment for more robust, adaptive, and diversified alpha factors.
Incorporate more dynamic trend adjustments, cross-asset correlations, and sentiment analysis for improved factor robustness.
Adjust weights, incorporate market regime, and refine cross-asset signals for improved factor robustness.
Consider shorter-term trends, MACD, and adaptive weighting for a more responsive and balanced factor.
Incorporate longer-term trends, cross-asset correlations, and market regime filters for more robust factor generation.
Incorporate dynamic weights, use shorter-term momentum, and include MACD for trend identification.
Incorporate macroeconomic indicators, use machine learning for dynamic weighting, and include a sentiment analysis for richer signals.
Incorporate non-linear transformations, shorter moving averages, and dynamic weighting for improved factor responsiveness and predictive power.
