Simplify, focus on key indicators, and use EMA for smoothing to enhance signal clarity.
Adjust window sizes, integrate more indicators, and optimize adaptive weights for improved factor robustness.
Reduce noise, balance indicators, and apply smoothing for more robust and interpretable alpha factors.
Reduce indicators, optimize weights, and focus on shorter-term trends for improved performance.
Use fixed weights, shorter trend window, and a logarithmic transformation for more stable and interpretable alpha factors.
Increase lookback periods, use non-linear transformations, and adjust dynamic weights for better trend adaptability.
Shorten time windows, adjust weights, and integrate more microstructure and sentiment for dynamic adaptability.
Standardize factor before non-linear transformation; consider cross-asset and macroeconomic factors for diversification.
Use longer lookback periods, fixed weights, and non-linear transformations for improved factor stability and performance.
Increase window sizes for smoother signals; balance dynamic weights; consider more advanced sentiment and microstructure indicators.
