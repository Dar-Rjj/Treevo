Consider trend duration, sentiment impact, and non-linear transformations for more robust and adaptive factors.
Normalize and smooth factors, use non-linear transformations, and integrate diverse indicators with adaptive weighting.
Incorporate more market microstructure, use adaptive and dynamic weights, and integrate sentiment analysis for robustness.
Incorporate more dynamic adaptive weights, integrate additional microstructure and sentiment indicators, and use shorter-term trends.
Incorporate more dynamic weights, sentiment, and microstructure indicators; optimize smoothing parameters.
Incorporate more adaptive and shorter-term trends, and integrate microstructure and sentiment for dynamic weighting.
Incorporate more adaptive and dynamic weights, add market microstructure, and use shorter-term trends for reactivity.
Incorporate more dynamic weights, advanced sentiment analysis, and additional market microstructure features.
Incorporate seasonality, external events, and use machine learning for dynamic weight adjustments.
Incorporate more dynamic weights, additional market microstructure, and sentiment analysis for improved performance.
