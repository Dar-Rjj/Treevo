```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between today's close price and yesterday's close price
    close_diff = df['close'].diff()
    # Calculate the weighted sum of price changes (OHLC) for the day
    weighted_sum_changes = (df['open'] + 2*df['high'] - 2*df['low'] + df['close']) / 6
    # Adjust the weighted sum changes by volume to emphasize the impact of volume
    adjusted_weighted_sum_changes = weighted_sum_changes * df['volume']
    # Combine the close price change with the adjusted weighted sum of price changes to create a signal
    factor_values = close_diff + adjusted_weighted_sum_changes
