```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close
    daily_return = df['close'].diff()
    
    # Calculate the 10-day standard deviation of daily returns
    volatility = daily_return.rolling(window=10).std()
    
    # Calculate a momentum factor as the 30-day cumulative return
    momentum = (df['close'] / df['close'].shift(30)) - 1
    
    # Combine the momentum and normalized volatility (to add a risk adjustment)
    # Higher volatility reduces the score, indicating higher risk
    factor = momentum - (volatility / volatility.mean())
    
    return factor
