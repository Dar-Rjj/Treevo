    momentum = df['close'].diff()
    
    # Calculate the percentage change in volume, indicating changes in liquidity or interest
    vol_change = df['volume'].pct_change().fillna(0)
    
    # Calculate a weighted difference of high and low prices, giving more importance to the high price,
    # this could indicate the strength of positive price movement
    weighted_price_diff = (1.5 * df['high'] - 0.5 * df['low']) / (df['close'] + 1e-7)
    
    # Combine the three indicators into an alpha factor
    alpha_factor = (momentum + 2 * vol_change * weighted_price_diff).ewm(span=3).mean()
