Combine linear and non-linear transformations, use ranking for normalization, and balance short-term and long-term factors.
Incorporate rank normalization and consider additional factors like market sentiment or macroeconomic indicators.
Incorporate longer-term trends and consider additional indicators like RSI or MACD for diversification.
Simplify transformations, integrate longer-term trends, and balance indicator weights for improved factor performance.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use exponential smoothing, and apply non-linear transformations for better factor differentiation.
Incorporate cross-sectional and time-series features, use non-linear combinations, and normalize for better factor stability.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and use robust non-linear combinations for better differentiation.
Incorporate RSI, volume ratios, and high-low ranges for more comprehensive trend and momentum analysis.
Combine additive and non-linear transformations, use ranking for differentiation, and consider long-term trends.
Incorporate more diverse indicators, use non-linear combinations, and normalize components for improved factor performance.
