    ma_10 = df['close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
    
    # Calculate difference between the current close price and the 10-day moving average
    diff_ma_10 = df['close'] - ma_10
    
    # Calculate momentum factor as the rate of change in close price from 30 days ago to today
    momentum_30 = df['close'] / df['close'].shift(30) - 1
    
    # Combine the factors into a single alpha signal
    # The factor assumes that the closer the current price is to the 10-day MA, 
    # and the stronger the positive 30-day momentum, the higher the factor value
    alpha_factor = diff_ma_10 + 5 * momentum_30
