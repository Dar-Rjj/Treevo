Incorporate more EWMA, VWAP, and RSI; reduce simple averages. Consider sector-specific factors.
Simplify calculations, use rolling means, and focus on key indicators. Incorporate volume wisely and rank factors.
Incorporate VWAP, longer-term ranges, and volume ratios; use ranking for normalization.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, normalize, and avoid overcomplicating with too many interacting factors.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and avoid over-complexity for more interpretable and effective alpha factors.
Simplify calculations, use rolling over ewm, combine fewer but more meaningful indicators, and normalize data.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and balance between momentum, volume, and volatility for clearer signals.
Incorporate more sophisticated volume-weighted metrics and longer-term trends for improved factor performance.
Incorporate more sophisticated statistical measures, use exponential smoothing, and include longer-term indicators for better signals.
Integrate liquidity, incorporate longer-term trends, and adjust for market volatility.
