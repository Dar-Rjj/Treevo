Incorporate VWAP, RSI, and longer timeframes for volatility and trend strength. Use exponential smoothing for more reactive indicators.
Simplify, use meaningful time frames, and incorporate volume more effectively. Rank normalization enhances comparability.
Focus on dynamic interactions, normalize and rank factors, use simpler moving averages, and avoid over-complexity.
Incorporate VWAP, volatility, and longer-term ranges; use volume ratios and rank normalization.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and use ranking for normalization.
Consider simplifying and normalizing components, focus on key indicators, and experiment with different lookback periods.
Use exponential smoothing, RSI, and longer-term trends for more robust and responsive factors.
Incorporate more nuanced metrics like VWAP, volatility, and RSI with dynamic windows for deeper trend analysis.
Normalize, use percentage changes, incorporate interaction terms, and apply rank transformation for robustness.
Incorporate more dynamic indicators, use exponential smoothing, and add diverse timeframes for a robust factor.
