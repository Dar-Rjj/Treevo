Consider longer EMA, include momentum and volatility, normalize with relevant standard deviations.
Incorporate longer-term EMAs, use non-linear transformations, and include rate of change for more dynamic factors.
Adjust EMA spans, use log1p for stability, consider shorter periods for momentum, and balance factor weights.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use non-linear transformations, and balance momentum with volatility.
Adjust EMA spans, use absolute differences, normalize with shorter std windows, and balance factor weights.
Incorporate longer-term EMAs, use absolute differences, and include market sentiment for improved stability and predictive power.
Vary EMA spans, use dynamic weighting, and incorporate momentum and volatility measures.
Adjust EMA and MFI periods, incorporate high/low prices, and experiment with different non-linear transformations.
Use shorter EMA spans, include momentum, and apply selective non-linear transformations.
Use shorter EMA spans, include price momentum, and apply meaningful non-linear transformations for enhanced factor effectiveness.
