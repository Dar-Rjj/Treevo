Incorporate more diverse volatility measures and momentum signals, adjust dynamic weights, and consider additional price-derived factors.
Use longer EMA, robust volatility, and incorporate price momentum with dynamic weighting for enhanced alpha.
Vary EMA spans, adjust standard deviation windows, and optimize factor weights for improved performance.
Incorporate more diverse factors, adjust periods, and balance weights for improved performance.
Extend lookback periods, use diverse non-linear transformations, and incorporate more market dynamics for robustness.
Increase robustness with longer EMA spans, use more stable volatility measures, and refine dynamic weighting for factor combination.
Use shorter EMA spans, robust volatility measures, and varied non-linear transformations for enhanced factor responsiveness.
Shorter EMA spans, additional momentum, and volatility factors improve performance. Consider seasonality and external economic indicators.
Increase EMAs span, use robust volatility, apply meaningful non-linear transformations, and optimize dynamic weights.
Increase EMA spans, use longer rolling windows, apply varied non-linear transformations, and adjust dynamic weighting for better factor performance.
