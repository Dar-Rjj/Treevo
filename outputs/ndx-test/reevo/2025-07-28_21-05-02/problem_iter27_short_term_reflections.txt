Adjust EMA spans, use shorter rolling windows, and refine dynamic weighting for more responsive factors.
Use longer-term EMAs, incorporate momentum, and consider high-low price differences for enhanced factor robustness.
Use longer-term EMAs, robust volatility measures, and incorporate momentum and price range factors.
Consider shorter EMA spans, different non-linear transformations, and varied dynamic weighting for improved factor responsiveness.
Increase lookback periods, use more robust transformations, and adjust dynamic weighting for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Optimize EMA spans, use diverse transformations, include momentum and volatility, and dynamically adjust weights.
Shorter EMA spans, additional factors, and dynamic weighting enhance factor performance.
Shorter EMA windows, adjusted dynamic weights, and relevant volatility measures improve factor effectiveness.
Vary EMA spans, adjust non-linear transformations, and optimize dynamic weightings for enhanced factor performance.
Increase window lengths for smoother trends; adjust weights and add more diverse factors.
