Incorporate trend, momentum, and relative strength with normalized volume for more robust alpha generation.
Incorporate non-linear transformations, volume trends, and additional moving averages for more robust factors.
Consider integrating momentum, volatility, and volume anomalies; use exponential smoothing for more recent data emphasis.
Leverage longer-term EMAs, standardize measures, and incorporate non-linear transformations for normalization and emphasis.
Incorporate volatility, trend, and volume with optimal weights; consider non-linear transformations and more sophisticated moving averages.
Incorporate momentum, EMA, volatility, and volume shock; use non-linear transformations for feature engineering.
Incorporate momentum, volatility normalization, and use exponential moving averages for more responsive trend signals.
Incorporate more sophisticated moving averages, volatility, and volume measures; use non-linear transformations.
Incorporate more sophisticated trends, use exponential smoothing, and normalize by volatility for robustness.
Use longer EMAs, incorporate volume volatility, and combine factors with weighted averages for robustness.
