Shorter EMA spans, additional momentum, and volume factors with dynamic weighting improve factor effectiveness.
Adjust EMAs and windows, balance factor weights, and incorporate more price/volume features for robustness.
Consider longer EMAs, dynamic factor weighting, and integrating more robust volatility measures.
Adjust weighting, incorporate more market indicators, and refine non-linear transformations for enhanced factor performance.
Adjust EMA spans, use dynamic weighting, and incorporate momentum for more robust factor generation.
Vary EMA spans, use shorter std windows, add momentum, and adjust dynamic weights for factor contributions.
Use shorter EMA spans, incorporate volume and price momentum, and include range for better signal responsiveness.
Consider shorter EMA spans, dynamic factor weighting, and incorporating more price and volume derivatives.
Vary EMA spans, use shorter std windows, and adjust dynamic weights for more sensitivity.
Adjust EMAs, use dynamic weighting, and incorporate more volatility measures for enhanced factor performance.
