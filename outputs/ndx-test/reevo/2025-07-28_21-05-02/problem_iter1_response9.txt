```python

    # Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close
    close_diff = df['close'].diff()
    
    # Calculate the average range (high - low) over the last 5 days
    avg_range_5d = (df['high'] - df['low']).rolling(window=5).mean()
    
    # Calculate the ratio of close difference to the 5-day average range
    factor_values = close_diff / (avg_range_5d + 1e-7)
    
    return factor_values
