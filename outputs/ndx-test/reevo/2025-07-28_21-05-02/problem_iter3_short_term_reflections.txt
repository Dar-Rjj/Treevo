Incorporate diverse indicators, normalize, and blend for richer signals; consider volatility, volume, and trend strength.
Incorporate longer-term trends, normalize using standard deviation, and consider additional features like volume for enhanced signals.
Incorporate volatility, momentum, and liquidity. Use normalized indicators and consider multi-day patterns for more robust factors.
Incorporate momentum, volatility normalization, and consider additional volume-adjusted price movements.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and volume trends; use multi-period analysis for robust signals.
Incorporate volatility, trend strength, and relative strength for more robust and predictive alpha factors.
Consider volatility, liquidity, and market sentiment. Incorporate multi-period analysis and use robust statistical measures.
Incorporate momentum, use exponential weighting, and consider market breadth for more robust factors.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and volume-weighted averages for more robust and dynamic alpha factor generation.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and volume shocks; explore non-linear transformations and custom time windows.
