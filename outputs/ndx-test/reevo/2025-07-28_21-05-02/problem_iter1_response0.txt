```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the closing price and the average of high and low for the day
    avg_high_low = (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2
    deviation_from_avg = df['close'] - avg_high_low
    
    # Weight the deviation by the ratio of volume relative to the moving average of volume
    volume_ratio = df['volume'] / df['volume'].rolling(window=20).mean()
    
    # Create the factor as a weighted deviation, capturing both price action significance and volume relevance
    alpha_factor = deviation_from_avg * volume_ratio
    return alpha_factor
