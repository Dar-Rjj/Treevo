Thought: Calculate the return of close price over a specific period as an alpha factor
    Thought: Use the daily return as a simple alpha factor
        Thought: Calculate the daily return by subtracting the close price of day t-1 from the close price of day t
        Thought: Calculate the average daily return over a 5-day window to smooth out short-term fluctuations
        Thought: Calculate the average daily return over a 10-day window for a medium-term perspective
        Thought: Calculate the average daily return over a 20-day window for a long-term perspective
    Thought: Incorporate volume information to enhance the return-based alpha factor
        Thought: Calculate the volume-weighted close price by multiplying the close price by the volume
        Thought: Calculate the daily return using the volume-weighted close prices instead of just the close prices
        Thought: Compute the 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day averages of the volume-weighted returns
    Thought: Analyze the intraday movement of the stock using the high and low prices
        Thought: Calculate the daily range by subtracting the low price from the high price
        Thought: Divide the daily range by the previous day's close price to get the relative range
        Thought: Average the relative range over 5, 10, and 20 days to capture the trend in intraday volatility
    Thought: Use the open price to understand the market sentiment at the start of the trading day
        Thought: Calculate the overnight return by subtracting the close price of day t-1 from the open price of day t
        Thought: Calculate the 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day averages of the overnight returns
        Thought: Combine the overnight return with the daily return to see if there is a pattern that can be exploited
Thought: Explore the relationship between the amount (dollar value traded) and the stock's performance
    Thought: Calculate the ratio of the amount to the volume to get the average transaction size
    Thought: Calculate the 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day moving averages of the average transaction size
    Thought: Analyze the change in the average transaction size to identify shifts in market participation
        Thought: Calculate the daily difference in the average transaction size
        Thought: Calculate the 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day averages of the changes in the average transaction size
    Thought: Investigate the impact of large transactions on future returns
        Thought: Identify days with significantly higher than average transaction sizes
        Thought: Calculate the return following such days and compare it to the overall return
        Thought: Calculate the 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day forward returns after these significant days
Thought: Develop a composite alpha factor by combining multiple individual factors
    Thought: Create a weighted sum of the average daily return, volume-weighted return, and overnight return
    Thought: Assign weights based on the historical correlation with future returns
    Thought: Calculate the 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day averages of the composite alpha factor
    Thought: Evaluate the predictive power of the composite alpha factor by comparing it to future returns
