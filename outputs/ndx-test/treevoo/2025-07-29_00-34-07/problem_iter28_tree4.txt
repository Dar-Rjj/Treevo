Crossover of Volume-Weighted Price Gaps with Integrated Price Momentum and High-Low Differential
├── Calculate Weighted Average of Price Gaps
│   ├── Calculate Price Gap Between Open and Close
│   │   └── Subtract Close price from Open price
│   ├── Calculate Current Day Volume Growth
│   │   └── Divide Current Day's Volume by Previous Day's Volume
│   └── Weight the Price Gaps
│       └── Multiply Each Price Gap by Corresponding Volume Growth, then Sum
├── Calculate Rolling High-Low Differential
│   ├── Determine 15-day Rolling High
│   │   └── Use High price
│   └── Subtract 25-day Rolling Low
│       └── Use Low price
├── Aggregate the Signals
│   ├── Add Weighted Rolling High-Low Differential
│   └── Subtract Long-Term Price Difference
│       └── Subtract Close price (t-25) from Close price (t)
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 1-day Price Return
│   │   └── Calculate Close price (t) divided by Close price (t-1) minus 1
│   ├── Compute 7-day Price Return
│   │   └── Calculate Close price (t) divided by Close price (t-7) minus 1
│   └── Compute 35-day Price Return
│       └── Calculate Close price (t) divided by Close price (t-35) minus 1
├── Average the Momentum
│   └── Average 1-day, 7-day, and 35-day Price Returns
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Weighted Average of Price Gaps
    ├── Add Aggregated Signal
    └── Subtract Averaged Price Momentum
