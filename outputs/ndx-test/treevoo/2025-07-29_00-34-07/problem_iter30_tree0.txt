        Sub-thought: Use MA to create a trend-following signal
            Sub-thought: Buy when price > 14-day MA, Sell when price < 14-day MA
    Sub-thought: Calculate 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
        Sub-thought: Use EMA for a smoother trend indicator
            Sub-thought: Buy when price > 20-day EMA, Sell when price < 20-day EMA

Thought: Investigate Volume-Weighted Factors
    Sub-thought: Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
        Sub-thought: Use VWAP as a benchmark for trading decisions
            Sub-thought: Buy when close price > VWAP, Sell when close price < VWAP
    Sub-thought: Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
        Sub-thought: Use OBV to identify buying or selling pressure
            Sub-thought: Buy when OBV is increasing, Sell when OBV is decreasing

Thought: Analyze Price Patterns
    Sub-thought: Identify Bullish and Bearish Engulfing Patterns

    Sub-thought: Identify Inside and Outside Days
        Sub-thought: Look for days where the high and low of the current day are within (Inside Day) or outside (Outside Day) the high and low of the previous day
            Sub-thought: Buy on Outside Day with higher close, Sell on Inside Day with lower close

Thought: Evaluate Volatility
    Sub-thought: Calculate Average True Range (ATR)
        Sub-thought: Use ATR to measure market volatility
            Sub-thought: Adjust position size based on ATR; reduce size in high volatility, increase in low volatility
    Sub-thought: Calculate Bollinger Bands
        Sub-thought: Use Bollinger Bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions
            Sub-thought: Buy when price touches the lower band, Sell when price touches the upper band

Thought: Consider Accumulation/Distribution Line
    Sub-thought: Calculate the Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) Line
        Sub-thought: Use A/D Line to gauge the cumulative flow of money into or out of a stock
            Sub-thought: Buy when A/D Line is increasing, Sell when A/D Line is decreasing
