Thought: Explore momentum and volatility as key indicators for future stock returns
  Sub-thought: Momentum factors
    Sub-thought: Calculate simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over different periods
      Sub-thought: Use SMA over 5 days, 10 days, and 20 days

    Sub-thought: Determine average true range (ATR) over a specific period
      Sub-thought: Use ATR over 14 days
    Sub-thought: Calculate standard deviation of log-returns over different windows
      Sub-thought: Use standard deviation over 5 days, 10 days, and 20 days
  Sub-thought: Volume and amount factors
    Sub-thought: Analyze volume trends
      Sub-thought: Identify if volume is increasing or decreasing
        Sub-thought: Compare current volume to the average volume over the past 5 days

      Sub-thought: Use MFI with a 14-day lookback period
  Sub-thought: Price action factors
    Sub-thought: Identify price patterns
      Sub-thought: Look for bullish and bearish engulfing patterns
      Sub-thought: Check for hammer and hanging man patterns
    Sub-thought: Calculate relative strength (RS) between high and low prices
      Sub-thought: Use RS to determine the strength of the trend
  Sub-thought: Combined factors
    Sub-thought: Create a composite factor combining momentum, volatility, and volume
