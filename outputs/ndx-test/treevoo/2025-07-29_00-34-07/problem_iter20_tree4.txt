Integrated Analysis of Price Momentum, Volume Flow, and High-Low Differential with Enhanced Components
├── Calculate Enhanced Price Difference
│   ├── Use Close price on day t
│   └── Subtract Close price on day t-20
│       └── Adjust by 3-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close prices
├── Calculate 50-day Rolling High-Low Differential
│   ├── Determine 50-day Rolling High
│   │   └── Use High price
│   └── Subtract 50-day Rolling Low
│       └── Use Low price
├── Weight by Volume Volatility
│   ├── Calculate 20-day Volume Volatility
│   │   ├── Use Volume on days t-1 to t-20
│   │   └── Calculate standard deviation
│   └── Multiply 50-day Rolling High-Low Differential by 20-day Volume Volatility
├── Aggregate the Signals
│   ├── Add Weighted 50-day Rolling High-Low Differential
│   └── Subtract Enhanced Price Difference
│       └── Adjusted by 3-day EMA
├── Calculate Averaged Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 3-day, 10-day, and 40-day Price Returns
│   │   ├── 3-day: Use Close price (t) and (t-3)
│   │   ├── 10-day: Use Close price (t) and (t-10)
│   │   └── 40-day: Use Close price (t) and (t-40)
│   └── Average the 3 Price Returns
└── Adjust for Volume
    ├── Calculate Daily Volume Percentage Change
    │   ├── Use Volume (t)
    │   └── Use Volume (t-1)
    └── Multiply Aggregated Signal by Volume Percentage Change
