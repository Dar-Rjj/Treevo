Enhanced High-Low Range and Momentum with Volume and Amount Integration
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   ├── High-Low Range: (High price (t) - Low price (t)) / Close price (t-1)
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── 1-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-1)) / Close price (t-1)
│   ├── 5-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-5)) / Close price (t-5)
│   └── 20-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-20)) / Close price (t-20)
├── Combine High-to-Low Range with Price Change
│   ├── Combined Value: High-Low Range * 100 + 1-day Price Return
├── Smoothing and Initial Momentum Calculation
│   ├── Apply Simple Moving Average on Combined Value over 5 days
│   └── Momentum Difference: SMA(Combined Value, 5 days) (t) - SMA(Combined Value, 5 days) (t-5)
├── Calculate Daily Log Return
│   └── Daily Log Return: log(Close price (t)) - log(Close price (t-1))
├── Calculate Weighted Average Momentum
│   ├── Weights
│   │   ├── Short-term weight: 0.4
│   │   ├── Medium-term weight: 0.3
│   │   └── Long-term weight: 0.3
│   └── Weighted Average Momentum: (Short-term weight * 1-day Price Return + Medium-term weight * 5-day Price Return + Long-term weight * 20-day Price Return)
├── Adjust for Volume
│   └── Daily Volume Change: Volume (t) - Volume (t-1)
└── Integrate Transaction Amount
    ├── Daily Amount Change: Amount (t) - Amount (t-1)
    ├── Final Volume Adjustment: Weighted Average Momentum * (1 + (Daily Volume Change + Daily Amount Change) / Volume (t-1))
    └── Final Factor: Momentum Difference + Final Volume Adjustment
