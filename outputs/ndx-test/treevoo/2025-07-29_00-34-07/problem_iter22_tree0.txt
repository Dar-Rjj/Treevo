- Analyze historical price and volume data for patterns
  - Calculate moving averages of closing prices
    - Implement a 50-day simple moving average
    - Implement a 200-day simple moving average
  - Evaluate the relationship between moving averages and future returns
    - Calculate the spread between 50-day and 200-day moving averages
    - Determine if the spread is positive (bullish) or negative (bearish)
  - Identify price trends using high and low prices
    - Compute Aroon Up and Aroon Down indicators
      - Track the number of days since the highest high over N days (Aroon Up)
      - Track the number of days since the lowest low over N days (Aroon Down)
    - Use Aroon Oscillator to measure the trend strength
  - Investigate volume changes for potential signals
    - Calculate the on-balance volume (OBV)
      - Adjust OBV by adding or subtracting the day's volume based on price movement
    - Assess the correlation between OBV and future returns
  - Explore price volatility
    - Compute the Average True Range (ATR) over N days
      - Measure the volatility by averaging true range values
    - Examine the effect of ATR on future returns
  - Combine multiple factors into a composite score
    - Assign weights to each factor based on historical performance
    - Sum the weighted factors to create a single alpha factor
    - Test the composite factor for predictive power
