├── Calculate Volume Trend
│   ├── Compute 5-day Moving Average of Volumes
│   │   ├── Use Volumes from the previous 5 days
│   │   └── Apply 5-day Moving Window
│   └── Multiply 5-day Moving Average by Current Day's Volume Growth
│       ├── Use Current Day's Volume
│       └── Divide by Previous Day's Volume
├── Filter by Relative Volume
│   ├── Calculate Average Volume over a period
│   │   ├── Use Volumes from the previous n days
