Enhanced High-Low Range, Price and Volume Momentum Synthesis with Crossover Innovations
├── Calculate Enhanced High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Calculate Price Change
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t-1
├── Combine Enhanced High-to-Low Range with Price Change
│   ├── Multiply Enhanced High-to-Low Range by 100
│   └── Add to Price Change
├── Smoothing and Initial Momentum Calculation
│   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average on Combined Value over 7 days
│   └── Calculate the difference between day t and day t-7
├── Calculate Daily Log Return
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Previous Day Close price
│       └── Apply Natural Logarithm
├── Calculate Multi-Day Price Momentum
│   ├── 3-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-3)) / Close price (t-3)
│   ├── 7-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-7)) / Close price (t-7)
│   └── 21-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-21)) / Close price (t-21)
├── Weighted Average the Momentum
│   └── (3*3-day Price Return + 7-day Price Return + 21-day Price Return) / 31
├── Adjust for Volume Changes
│   ├── Daily Volume Percentage Change: (Volume (t) - Volume (t-1)) / Volume (t-1)
│   └── Final Volume Adjustment: Weighted Average Momentum * (1 + Daily Volume Percentage Change)
├── Intermediate Factor Combination
│   ├── Sum Smoothing and Initial Momentum
│   └── Sum Weighted and Volume-Adjusted Price Momentum
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Today's Close
│   └── Subtract 5-Day Weighted Moving Average of Close
│       └── Multiply by Log Return
├── Introduce High-Frequency Volatility
│   ├── Calculate True Range: Max(High - Low, Abs(High - Close(t-1)), Abs(Low - Close(t-1)))
│   └── Compute 15-day Simple Moving Average of True Range
├── Adjust for High-Frequency Volatility
│   └── Divide Volume-Weighted Price Momentum by 15-day SMA of True Range
├── Additional Momentum Factor
│   ├── Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices for the last 5 days.
│   └── Subtract the SMA from the current day's closing price to get the momentum value.
├── Additional Volatility Factor
│   ├── Calculate the daily range by subtracting the low price from the high price.
│   ├── Compute the average daily range over the last 10 days.
│   └── Use the standard deviation of the daily ranges over the last 10 days as the volatility measure.
├── Additional Money Flow Index (MFI) Factor
│   ├── Calculate the typical price for each day by averaging the high, low, and close prices.
│   ├── Determine the raw money flow by multiplying the typical price by the volume.
│   ├── Classify the money flow as positive or negative based on whether the typical price is higher or lower than the previous day's typical price.
│   ├── Calculate the positive and negative money flow sums over the last 14 days.
│   └── Divide the positive money flow sum by the total money flow (positive + negative) to get the MFI value.
├── Additional Relative Strength (RS) Factor
│   ├── Calculate the total return for the last 26 weeks by summing the percentage changes in closing prices.
│   ├── Calculate the total return for the last 14 weeks by summing the percentage changes in closing prices.
│   └── Divide the 26-week total return by the 14-week total return to get the RS value.
├── Additional Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Factor
│   ├── Calculate the typical price for each day by averaging the high, low, and close prices.
│   ├── Multiply the typical price by the volume to get the daily VWAP contribution.
│   ├── Sum the daily VWAP contributions over the last 20 days.
│   ├── Sum the volumes over the last 20 days.
│   └── Divide the sum of the VWAP contributions by the sum of the volumes to get the VWAP value.
