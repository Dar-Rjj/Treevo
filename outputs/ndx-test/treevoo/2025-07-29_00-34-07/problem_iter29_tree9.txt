[Calculate Momentum Factors]
    [Compute Short-Term Momentum Factor (SMA 10 Day)]
        Calculate the Simple Moving Average of the closing prices over the last 10 days.
    [Compute Long-Term Momentum Factor (SMA 50 Day)]
        Calculate the Simple Moving Average of the closing prices over the last 50 days.
    [Momentum Signal]
        Subtract the 50-day SMA from the 10-day SMA to generate a momentum signal.

[Calculate Volume Factors]
    [Compute Short-Term Average Volume (10 Day)]
        Calculate the average volume over the last 10 days.
    [Compute Long-Term Average Volume (50 Day)]
        Calculate the average volume over the last 50 days.
    [Volume Signal]
        Subtract the 50-day average volume from the 10-day average volume to generate a volume signal.

[Generate Price and Volume Combination Factor]
    [Price-Volume Strength Indicator]
        Multiply the momentum signal by the volume signal to get a combined price and volume strength indicator.
    
[Calculate Open-High-Low-Close Factors]
    [Intraday Range Factor]
        Subtract the daily low from the daily high for each day.
    [Intraday Directional Bias]
        Compare the open and close prices. If close is higher, assign +1; if lower, -1.
    [Intraday Volatility Weighted Direction]
        Multiply the intraday range by the intraday directional bias to get the intraday volatility weighted direction.

[Combine All Factors]
    [Composite Alpha Factor]
        Sum the combined price and volume strength indicator and the intraday volatility weighted direction to create a composite alpha factor.
