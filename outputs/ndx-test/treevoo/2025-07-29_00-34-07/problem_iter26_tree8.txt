[Alpha Factor Generation]
- [Momentum Indicators]
  - [Simple Moving Average Crossover]
    - Calculate the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices.
    - Calculate the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices.
    - Generate a signal where: 
      - If 50-day SMA > 200-day SMA, signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If 50-day SMA < 200-day SMA, signal = -1 (Bearish)
  - [Rate of Change (ROC)]
    - Calculate the percentage change in closing price over a 12-day period.
    - Generate a signal where:
      - If ROC > 0, signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If ROC < 0, signal = -1 (Bearish)
- [Volume Indicators]
  - [On-Balance Volume (OBV)]
    - Initialize OBV at 0.
    - For each day, if the close is higher than the previous close, add the volume to OBV.
    - For each day, if the close is lower than the previous close, subtract the volume from OBV.
    - For each day, if the close is equal to the previous close, keep OBV unchanged.
    - Generate a signal where:
      - If OBV(t) > OBV(t-1), signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If OBV(t) < OBV(t-1), signal = -1 (Bearish)
- [Price Action Indicators]
  - [Candlestick Patterns]
    - Identify Bullish Engulfing patterns.
    - Identify Bearish Engulfing patterns.
    - Generate a signal where:
      - If Bullish Engulfing, signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If Bearish Engulfing, signal = -1 (Bearish)
  - [Gap Analysis]
    - Check for gaps between the high of the previous day and the low of the current day.
    - Generate a signal where:
      - If there is an upward gap, signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If there is a downward gap, signal = -1 (Bearish)
- [Combining Factors]
  - Assign weights to each factor (e.g., SMA Crossover: 0.4, ROC: 0.3, OBV: 0.2, Candlestick: 0.1).
  - Compute a weighted sum of the signals from each factor.
  - Generate a final alpha signal based on the weighted sum.
- [New Combined Factor]
  - [Combined Momentum and Volume]
    - Calculate the 50-day and 200-day SMAs of the On-Balance Volume (OBV).
    - Generate a signal where:
      - If 50-day OBV SMA > 200-day OBV SMA, signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If 50-day OBV SMA < 200-day OBV SMA, signal = -1 (Bearish)
  - [Combined Price Action and Gap]
    - Identify days with both Bullish Engulfing and upward gaps.
    - Identify days with both Bearish Engulfing and downward gaps.
    - Generate a signal where:
      - If Bullish Engulfing and upward gap, signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If Bearish Engulfing and downward gap, signal = -1 (Bearish)
- [Final Combination]
  - Assign weights to each new combined factor (e.g., Combined Momentum and Volume: 0.5, Combined Price Action and Gap: 0.5).
  - Compute a weighted sum of the signals from each new combined factor.
  - Generate a final alpha signal based on the weighted sum.
