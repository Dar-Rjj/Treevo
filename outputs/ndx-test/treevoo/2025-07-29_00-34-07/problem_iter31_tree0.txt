Crossover of Integrated Price and Volume Momentum with Enhanced High-Low Range, and Price and Volume Synthesis
├── Weighted Average of Price Gaps
│   ├── Price Gap: High price - Low price
│   ├── Volume Trend: 5-day Moving Average of Volumes * (Current Day's Volume / Previous Day's Volume)
│   └── Sum(Price Gap * Volume Trend)
├── Volume-Adjusted Rolling High-Low Differential
│   ├── 20-day Rolling High: Use High price
│   ├── 20-day Rolling Low: Use Low price
│   ├── Volume Volatility: Standard Deviation of Volumes (t-1 to t-10)
│   └── Multiply (20-day Rolling High - 20-day Rolling Low) by Volume Volatility
├── Aggregate the Signals
│   ├── Add Volume-Adjusted Rolling High-Low Differential
│   └── Subtract 10-Day Price Difference: Close price (t) - Close price (t-10)
├── Enhanced High-to-Low Range and Price Change
│   ├── (High price (t) - Low price (t)) / Close price (t-1)
│   ├── 1-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-1)) / Close price (t-1)
│   └── Combined Value: High-Low Range * 100 + 1-day Price Return
├── Multi-Day Price Momentum
│   ├── 1-day Price Return
│   ├── 7-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-7)) / Close price (t-7)
│   ├── 14-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-14)) / Close price (t-14)
│   └── 30-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-30)) / Close price (t-30)
├── Weighted Average Momentum
│   ├── Short-term weight: 0.4
│   ├── Medium-term weight: 0.3
│   ├── Long-term weight: 0.3
│   └── (Short-term weight * 1-day Price Return) + (Medium-term weight * 7-day Price Return) + (Long-term weight * 30-day Price Return)
├── Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Daily Volume Change: Volume (t) - Volume (t-1)
│   └── (Weighted Average Momentum * (1 + (Daily Volume Change) / Volume (t-1)))
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply the result from Weighted Average of Price Gaps
    ├── Add the result from Aggregate the Signals
    └── Add Volume-Adjusted Momentum
