Calculate High-to-Low Range and Rolling High-Low Differential
├── Use High price
│   └── Determine 25-day Rolling High
└── Use Low price
    ├── Compute (High - Low) / Low
    └── Subtract 25-day Rolling Low

Price Difference and Momentum Calculation
├── Calculate Price Change
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t-1
├── Calculate 2-day Price Return
│   ├── Use Close price (t)
│   └── Use Close price (t-2)
├── Calculate 7-day Price Return
│   ├── Use Close price (t)
│   └── Use Close price (t-7)
└── Calculate 30-day Price Return
    ├── Use Close price (t)
    └── Use Close price (t-30)

Volume Adjustments and Volume Volatility
├── Daily Volume Percentage Change: (Volume (t) - Volume (t-1)) / Volume (t-1)
├── Calculate Volume Volatility
│   ├── Use Volume on days t-1 to t-15
│   └── Calculate standard deviation
└── Final Volume Adjustment: (High-to-Low Range + Rolling High-Low Differential) * (1 + 2 * Daily Volume Percentage Change) * Volume Volatility

Smoothing and Initial Momentum Calculation
├── Combine High-to-Low Range, Rolling High-Low Differential, and Price Change
│   ├── Multiply High-to-Low Range by 150
│   └── Add to Price Change and Rolling High-Low Differential
├── Apply Simple Moving Average on Combined Value over 7 days
└── Calculate the difference between day t and day t-7

Averaged Price Momentum and High-Low Range Sum
├── Sum the 2-day, 7-day, and 30-day Price Returns
├── Divide by 3
└── Sum of Daily Price Ranges for Filtered Days
    ├── For Each Filtered Day
    │   ├── Calculate Daily Price Range
    │   │   ├── Use High price
    │   │   └── Use Low price
    │   └── Sum of Daily Price Ranges for Filtered Days
    └── Weight the Price Gaps
        ├── Multiply Each Price Gap by Corresponding Volume Growth
        └── Sum All Weighted Price Gaps

Intermediate Factor Combination
├── Sum Smoothing and Initial Momentum
└── Sum Averaged and Volume-Adjusted Price Momentum

Weighted Price Momentum
├── Use Today's Close
└── Subtract 15-Day Moving Average of Close
    └── Multiply by Logarithm of Close price

Final Alpha Factor Construction
├── Add Sum of Daily Price Ranges to Sum of Weighted Price Gaps
├── Multiply Combined Value by Average Momentum
├── Sum Intermediate Factor Combination
├── Add Weighted Price Momentum
└── Incorporate Enhanced Volume-Filtered High-Low Range
