├── Adjusted High-Low Cumulative Return and Price Gaps
│   ├── For Each Filtered Day, Calculate Daily Price Range (High - Low)
│   │   └── Sum All Daily Price Ranges for Filtered Days
│   ├── For Each Filtered Day, Calculate Price Gap (|Open - Close|)
│   └── Adjust the Price Gaps (Multiply Each Gap by Volume Growth Factor (Volume(t) / Average Volume))
├── Calculate 25-day Rolling High-Low Differential
│   ├── Determine 25-day Rolling High
│   │   └── Use High price
│   └── Subtract 25-day Rolling Low
│       └── Use Low price
├── Weight by Volume Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Volume Volatility
│   │   ├── Use Volume on days t-1 to t-15
│   │   └── Calculate standard deviation
│   └── Multiply 25-day Rolling High-Low Differential by Volume Volatility
├── Aggregate the Signals

└── Adjust for Volume
    ├── Calculate Daily Volume Percentage Change
    │   ├── Use Volume (t)
    │   └── Use Volume (t-1)
    └── Multiply Aggregated Signal by Volume Percentage Change
