Thought: Calculate the momentum factor based on the closing prices of the last 5 days.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices for the last 5 days.
- Sub-thought: Subtract the SMA from the current day's closing price to get the momentum value.

Thought: Develop a volatility factor using high and low prices over the last 10 days.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the daily range by subtracting the low price from the high price.
- Sub-thought: Compute the average daily range over the last 10 days.
- Sub-thought: Use the standard deviation of the daily ranges over the last 10 days as the volatility measure.

Thought: Create a money flow index (MFI) factor using close, high, low, and volume data over the last 14 days.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the typical price for each day by averaging the high, low, and close prices.
- Sub-thought: Determine the raw money flow by multiplying the typical price by the volume.
- Sub-thought: Classify the money flow as positive or negative based on whether the typical price is higher or lower than the previous day's typical price.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the positive and negative money flow sums over the last 14 days.
- Sub-thought: Divide the positive money flow sum by the total money flow (positive + negative) to get the MFI value.

Thought: Construct a relative strength (RS) factor using the closing prices of the last 26 weeks and the last 14 weeks.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the total return for the last 26 weeks by summing the percentage changes in closing prices.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the total return for the last 14 weeks by summing the percentage changes in closing prices.
- Sub-thought: Divide the 26-week total return by the 14-week total return to get the RS value.

Thought: Formulate a volume weighted average price (VWAP) factor using the opening, high, low, close, and volume data over the last 20 days.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the typical price for each day by averaging the high, low, and close prices.
- Sub-thought: Multiply the typical price by the volume to get the daily VWAP contribution.
- Sub-thought: Sum the daily VWAP contributions over the last 20 days.
- Sub-thought: Sum the volumes over the last 20 days.
- Sub-thought: Divide the sum of the VWAP contributions by the sum of the volumes to get the VWAP value.
