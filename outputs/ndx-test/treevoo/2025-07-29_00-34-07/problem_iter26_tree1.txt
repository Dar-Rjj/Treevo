Crossover of Enhanced Integrated Price and Volume Momentum, High-Low Range, and Synthesized Cumulative Returns
├── Calculate Weighted Average of Price Gaps

├── Rolling High-Low Differential
│   ├── 20-day Rolling High: Use High price
│   └── Subtract 20-day Rolling Low: Use Low price
├── Weight by Volume Volatility
│   ├── Volume Volatility: Standard Deviation of Volumes (t-1 to t-10)
│   └── Multiply Rolling High-Low Differential by Volume Volatility
├── Adjust for Volume Changes
│   ├── Daily Volume Percentage Change: (Volume (t) - Volume (t-1)) / Volume (t-1)
│   └── Final Volume Adjustment: Volume-Weighted Rolling High-Low Differential * (1 + 2 * Daily Volume Percentage Change)
├── Aggregate the Signals

│   └── Subtract 15-Day Price Difference: Close price (t) - Close price (t-15)
├── High-to-Low Range
│   ├── (High price (t) - Low price (t)) / Close price (t-1)
├── Combine High-to-Low Range with Price Change
│   ├── 1-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-1)) / Close price (t-1)
│   └── Combined Value: High-Low Range * 100 + 1-day Price Return

├── Average the Momentum
│   ├── Sum the 2-day, 7-day, and 30-day Price Returns
│   └── Divide by 3
