Crossover of Integrated Price and Volume Momentum with Enhanced High-Low Range, and Price and Volume Synthesis
├── Calculate Weighted Average of Price Gaps
│   ├── Price Gap: High price - Low price
│   ├── Volume Trend: 5-day Moving Average of Volumes * (Current Day's Volume / Previous Day's Volume)
│   └── Sum(Price Gap * Volume Trend)
├── Rolling High-Low Differential
│   ├── 20-day Rolling High: Use High price
│   └── Subtract 20-day Rolling Low: Use Low price
├── Weight by Volume Volatility
│   ├── Volume Volatility: Standard Deviation of Volumes (t-1 to t-10)
│   └── Multiply Rolling High-Low Differential by Volume Volatility
├── Aggregate the Signals
│   ├── Add Weighted Rolling High-Low Differential
│   └── Subtract 10-Day Price Difference: Close price (t) - Close price (t-10)
├── High-to-Low Range
│   ├── (High price (t) - Low price (t)) / Close price (t-1)
├── Combine High-to-Low Range with Price Change
│   ├── 1-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-1)) / Close price (t-1)
│   └── Combined Value: High-Low Range * 100 + 1-day Price Return
├── Smoothing and Initial Momentum Calculation
│   ├── EMA(Combined Value, 5 days) (t) - EMA(Combined Value, 5 days) (t-5)
├── Multi-Day Price Momentum
│   ├── 1-day Price Return
│   ├── 7-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-7)) / Close price (t-7)
│   ├── 14-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-14)) / Close price (t-14)
│   └── 30-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-30)) / Close price (t-30)
├── Weighted Average Momentum
│   ├── Short-term weight: 0.4
│   ├── Medium-term weight: 0.3
│   ├── Long-term weight: 0.3
│   └── (Short-term weight * 1-day Price Return) + (Medium-term weight * 7-day Price Return) + (Long-term weight * 30-day Price Return)
├── Final Volume Adjustment
│   ├── Daily Volume Change: Volume (t) - Volume (t-1)
│   └── (Weighted Average Momentum * (1 + (Daily Volume Change) / Volume (t-1)))
├── Integrate Transaction Amount
│   ├── Daily Amount Change: Amount (t) - Amount (t-1)
│   └── Intermediate Volume Adjustment: Final Volume Adjustment * (1 + (Daily Amount Change) / Amount (t-1))
├── Intermediate Factor Combination
│   ├── Sum Smoothing and Initial Momentum
│   └── Add Weighted and Volume-Adjusted Price Momentum
├── Volume-Weighted Price Momentum
│   ├── Today's Close
│   └── Subtract 10-Day EMA of Close * Log Return: log(Close price (t)) - log(Close price (t-1))
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply the result from Weighted Average of Price Gaps
    ├── Add the Intermediate Factor Combination
    └── Add Volume-Weighted Price Momentum
