def heuristics_v2(df):
    """
    The function `heuristics_v2` computes a novel alpha factor based on the given market features.
    It calculates the difference between the high and low prices, normalized by the close price,
    and further incorporates the volume information to create a more robust signal.
    
    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame with columns ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'] indexed by date.
        
    Returns:
        pd.Series: A Series with the computed alpha factor values indexed by date.
