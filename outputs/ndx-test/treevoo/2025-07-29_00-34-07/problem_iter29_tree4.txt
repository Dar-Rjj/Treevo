[Improved Alpha Factor Generation]
- [Momentum and Volume Indicators]
  - [High-to-Low Range and Price Change]
    - Use High price
    - Use Low price
    - Calculate High-to-Low Range
    - Use Close price of day t
    - Use Open price of day t-1
    - Calculate Price Change
    - Multiply High-to-Low Range by 150
    - Add to Price Change
    - Apply Simple Moving Average on Combined Value over 7 days
    - Calculate the difference between day t and day t-7
  - [Multi-Day Price Momentum and Volume Adjustment]
    - 3-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-3)) / Close price (t-3)
    - 10-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-10)) / Close price (t-10)
    - 30-day Price Return: (Close price (t) - Close price (t-30)) / Close price (t-30)
    - Average the Momentum: (3-day Price Return + 10-day Price Return + 30-day Price Return) / 3
    - Daily Volume Percentage Change: (Volume (t) - Volume (t-1)) / Volume (t-1)
    - Final Volume Adjustment: Average Momentum * (1 + 2 * Daily Volume Percentage Change)
- [Price Action and Gap Analysis]
  - [Candlestick Patterns]
    - Identify Bullish Engulfing patterns
    - Identify Bearish Engulfing patterns
    - Generate a signal where:
      - If Bullish Engulfing, signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If Bearish Engulfing, signal = -1 (Bearish)
  - [Gap Analysis]
    - Check for gaps between the high of the previous day and the low of the current day
    - Generate a signal where:
      - If there is an upward gap, signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If there is a downward gap, signal = -1 (Bearish)
- [Combining Factors]
  - [Intermediate Factor Combination]
    - Sum Smoothing and Initial Momentum
    - Sum Averaged and Volume-Adjusted Price Momentum
  - [Weighted Crossover and ROC]
    - Calculate the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices
    - Calculate the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices
    - Generate a signal where: 
      - If 50-day SMA > 200-day SMA, signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If 50-day SMA < 200-day SMA, signal = -1 (Bearish)
    - Calculate the percentage change in closing price over a 12-day period (ROC)
    - Generate a signal where:
      - If ROC > 0, signal = 1 (Bullish)
      - If ROC < 0, signal = -1 (Bearish)
- [On-Balance Volume (OBV)]
  - Initialize OBV at 0
  - For each day, if the close is higher than the previous close, add the volume to OBV
  - For each day, if the close is lower than the previous close, subtract the volume from OBV
  - For each day, if the close is equal to the previous close, keep OBV unchanged
  - Generate a signal where:
    - If OBV(t) > OBV(t-1), signal = 1 (Bullish)
    - If OBV(t) < OBV(t-1), signal = -1 (Bearish)
- [Final Combination]
  - Assign weights to each factor (e.g., High-to-Low and Price Change: 0.4, Candlestick and Gap: 0.2, Crossover and ROC: 0.2, OBV: 0.2)
  - Compute a weighted sum of the signals from each factor
  - Generate a final alpha signal based on the weighted sum
- [Rolling High-Low Differential and Volume Volatility]
  - Determine 25-day Rolling High using High price
  - Subtract 25-day Rolling Low using Low price
  - Calculate Volume Volatility using Volume on days t-1 to t-15
  - Multiply 25-day Rolling High-Low Differential by Volume Volatility
- [Aggregate and Adjust Signals]
  - Add Weighted 25-day Rolling High-Low Differential
  - Subtract Smoothing and Initial Momentum
  - Calculate Daily Volume Percentage Change
  - Multiply Aggregated Signal by Volume Percentage Change
- [Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return]
  - Use Open price
  - Use Close price
