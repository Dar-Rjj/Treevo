Thought: Create a Momentum Indicator
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 12-day Rate of Change (ROC) using closing prices
- Sub-thought: Smooth the ROC over 25 days using a simple moving average (SMA)
- Sub-thought: Determine the Momentum Signal
  - Sub-sub-thought: If the smoothed ROC is positive, signal = 1, else signal = -1

Thought: Develop a Volume-based Strength Indicator
- Sub-thought: Compute the 20-day Volume Moving Average (VMA)
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the Volume Ratio by dividing the current day's volume by the VMA
- Sub-thought: Assign a Volume Score
  - Sub-sub-thought: If the Volume Ratio > 1, score = 1; if equal = 0; otherwise score = -1

Thought: Construct a Price Volatility Indicator
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Daily Range by subtracting the low from the high for each day
- Sub-thought: Compute the 14-day Average True Range (ATR) using the daily range
- Sub-thought: Analyze the ATR Trend
  - Sub-sub-thought: If current ATR > previous ATR, trend = 1; else trend = -1

Thought: Formulate a Money Flow Index (MFI)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Typical Price as (High + Low + Close) / 3
- Sub-thought: Determine Positive and Negative Money Flow
  - Sub-sub-thought: If today's typical price > yesterday's, it's positive flow; otherwise, negative
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 14-day Money Flow Ratio
  - Sub-sub-thought: Sum of positive money flow / sum of negative money flow
- Sub-thought: Compute MFI as 100 - (100 / (1 + Money Flow Ratio))
- Sub-thought: Interpret MFI
  - Sub-sub-thought: If MFI < 20, condition = oversold; if MFI > 80, condition = overbought; else neutral

Thought: Design an Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Money Flow Multiplier as ((Close - Low) - (High - Close)) / (High - Low)
- Sub-thought: Update the A/D Line by adding the Money Flow Multiplier multiplied by the period's volume to the previous A/D Line
- Sub-thought: Analyze the A/D Line Trend
  - Sub-sub-thought: If the A/D Line is rising, market accumulation; if falling, distribution
