Alpha Mining for Stock Returns Prediction
- Momentum-Based Factors
  - Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages
    - The factor value is the difference between the 50-day and 200-day SMAs
  - Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Measure the percentage change in price over a specified period, such as 12 days
- Reversal-Based Factors
  - Short-Term Overbought/Oversold Indicator
    - Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a lookback period of 14 days
  - Extreme Price Movements
    - Identify days where the close-to-open ratio is significantly above or below the average
- Volume-Price Interaction
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Accumulate volume on up-days and subtract it on down-days
  - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Calculate the sum of the Accumulation/Distribution Line values over a 20-period
    - Divide by the total volume over the same period to get the CMF
- Volume and Amount-Based Factors
  - Volume Breakout
    - Identify significant volume spikes compared to the 30-day average volume
  - Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Calculate the VWAP for each day
  - Volume-Price Correlation
    - Compute the correlation between daily price changes and volume
- Hybrid Factors
  - Momentum and Volume Combined
    - Combine the ROC with the CMF to create a hybrid momentum-volume indicator
  - Reversal and Volume Combined
    - Combine the RSI with the OBV to create a hybrid reversal-volume indicator
