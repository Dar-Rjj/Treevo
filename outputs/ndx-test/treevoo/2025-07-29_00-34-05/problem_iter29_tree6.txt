Use Price and Volume-Based Features for Alpha Factor Generation
├── Calculate Momentum Indicators
│   ├── Compute the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices over a 10-day window
│   ├── Determine the Rate of Change (ROC) of closing prices over a 20-day period
│   ├── Use Close price (t)
│   └── Subtract Close price (t-20)
├── Analyze Price Patterns and Breakouts
│   ├── Identify if the close price is above its 30-day high, indicating a potential breakout
│   ├── Check if the close price is below its 60-day low, suggesting a breakdown
│   ├── Detect Bearish Engulfing patterns by checking if the current close is below the previous open and the current open is above the previous close
│   └── Look for Bullish Engulfing signals where the current close is above the previous open and the current open is below the previous close
├── Incorporate Volume and Trading Activity
│   ├── Evaluate if today's volume exceeds the 50-day moving average volume, signaling increased trading activity
│   ├── Measure the percentage increase in volume from the previous day to today, capturing sudden interest spikes
│   ├── Use Volume (t)
│   ├── Divide by Average Volume (last 30 days)
│   ├── Use Amount (t)
│   └── Divide by Average Amount (last 30 days)
├── Examine Volatility and Risk
│   ├── Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) over a 14-day period to gauge market volatility
│   ├── Find the standard deviation of the daily returns over the last 30 days as a measure of risk
│   ├── Use Close price (t)
│   └── Calculate Standard Deviation of Close prices (last 30 days)
├── Consider Market Sentiment and Reversals
│   ├── Detect Bearish Engulfing patterns by checking if the current close is below the previous open and the current open is above the previous close
│   └── Look for Bullish Engulfing signals where the current close is above the previous open and the current open is below the previous close
├── Daily Enhanced Dynamic Price Range
│   ├── Subtract Low price (t) from High price (t)
│   └── Multiply by (Close price (t) / Open price (t))
├── Average Trading Price
│   ├── Add (Open + High + Low + Close) (t)
│   └── Divide by 4
├── Volume Adjusted Enhanced Range
│   ├── Multiply (Daily Enhanced Dynamic Price Range / Average Trading Price) (t)
│   │   └── Ensure non-zero division
│   └── Multiply by Volume (t)
├── Short-Term Rolling Avg of Volume Adjusted Enhanced Range
│   ├── Use last 15 days' Volume Adjusted Enhanced Range
│   └── Sum and divide by 15
├── Long-Term Rolling Avg of Volume Adjusted Enhanced Range
│   ├── Use last 25 days' Volume Adjusted Enhanced Range
│   └── Sum and divide by 25
├── Combine Momentum and Volume Impact
│   ├── Momentum (t)
│   └── Multiply by Volume Impact Adjustment (t)
├── Adjust for Price Volatility
│   ├── Combined Momentum and Volume (t)
│   └── Divide by Price Volatility (last 30 days)
├── High-Low Range Momentum
│   ├── Compute 7-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of High-Low Range
│   │   ├── Use High-Low Range
│   │   ├── Use smoothing factor alpha = 2 / (N + 1), N=7
│   │   └── Apply EMA formula
│   └── Calculate Daily Change in EMA
│       ├── Use today's EMA
│       └── Use yesterday's EMA
├── Volume Shock
│   ├── Compute Volume Percentage Change
│   │   ├── Use today's Volume
│   │   └── Use yesterday's Volume
│   └── Identify Significant Volume Changes
│       ├── Set a threshold for significant volume change, e.g., 60%
│       └── Flag days with volume changes above the threshold
├── High-Frequency Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 5-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices
│   │   ├── Use Close price (t)
│   │   ├── Use smoothing factor alpha = 2 / (N + 1), N=5
│   │   └── Apply EMA formula
│   └── Calculate Daily Change in EMA
│       ├── Use today's EMA
│       └── Use yesterday's EMA
