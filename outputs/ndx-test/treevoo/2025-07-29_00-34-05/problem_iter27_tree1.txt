Thought: Explore price patterns and trade volume for alpha factors
    Subthought: Calculate simple moving averages to identify trends
        Subthought: Compute 5-day simple moving average (SMA5)
        Subthought: Compute 20-day simple moving average (SMA20)
        Subthought: Determine if SMA5 is above SMA20 (trend indicator)
    Subthought: Examine the relationship between open, high, low, and close prices
        Subthought: Calculate the difference between high and low prices (price range)
        Subthought: Calculate the ratio of close to open prices (close-to-open ratio)
        Subthought: Determine if the close price is higher than the open price (positive day indicator)
    Subthought: Analyze volume-related indicators
        Subthought: Calculate the 5-day and 20-day moving averages of volume (VMA5, VMA20)
        Subthought: Determine if VMA5 is above VMA20 (volume trend indicator)
        Subthought: Compute the ratio of current day's volume to the 20-day average volume (volume spike indicator)
    Subthought: Combine multiple factors to create a composite factor
        Subthought: Sum the following binary indicators: SMA5 > SMA20, close > open, VMA5 > VMA20, and volume spike
        Subthought: Assign weights to each binary indicator based on their predictive power
        Subthought: Calculate a weighted score for each day
