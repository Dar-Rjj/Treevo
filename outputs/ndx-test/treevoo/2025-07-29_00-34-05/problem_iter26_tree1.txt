Thought: Deriving Integrated and Enhanced Alpha Factors from Price, Volume, and Momentum
- Sub-Thought: Analyzing Price Movements and Momentum
  - Sub-Thought: Calculating Price Differences and Short-Term/Long-Term Momentum
    - Sub-Thought: Day-to-Day Open Price Difference (open[t] - open[t-1])
    - Sub-Thought: Day-to-Day Close Price Difference (close[t] - close[t-1])
    - Sub-Thought: Intra-Day Price Movement (high[t] - low[t])
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate 5-day EMA of Close Price
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate 10-day EMA of Close Price
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate 20-day EMA of Close Price
    - Sub-Thought: Subtract 10-day EMA from 5-day EMA (Short-Term Momentum)
    - Sub-Thought: Subtract 20-day EMA from 5-day EMA (Momentum Difference)
  - Sub-Thought: Identifying Trend Reversals
    - Sub-Thought: Detecting Bullish Reversals (low[t-1] > low[t] and close[t] > open[t])
    - Sub-Thought: Detecting Bearish Reversals (high[t-1] < high[t] and close[t] < open[t])
- Sub-Thought: Analyzing Volume Changes and Volume Influence
  - Sub-Thought: Calculating Volume Differences
    - Sub-Thought: Day-to-Day Volume Difference (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
  - Sub-Thought: Identifying Volume Spikes Relative to Price
    - Sub-Thought: High Volume with Minimal Price Change (abs(close[t] - close[t-1]) < threshold and volume[t] > mean(volume[0:t-1]))
    - Sub-Thought: Low Volume with Significant Price Change (abs(close[t] - close[t-1]) > threshold and volume[t] < mean(volume[0:t-1]))
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate 5-day EMA of Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate 10-day EMA of Volume
  - Sub-Thought: Subtract 10-day EMA of Volume from 5-day EMA of Volume (Volume Acceleration)
- Sub-Thought: Combining Price and Volume for Insight
  - Sub-Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Sub-Thought: Adjust OBV Based on Price Changes
      - Sub-Thought: If close[t] > close[t-1], add volume[t] to OBV
      - Sub-Thought: If close[t] < close[t-1], subtract volume[t] from OBV
  - Sub-Thought: Money Flow Index (MFI)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Typical Price (typical_price[t] = (high[t] + low[t] + close[t]) / 3)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Raw Money Flow (money_flow[t] = typical_price[t] * volume[t])
    - Sub-Thought: Determine Positive and Negative Money Flow
      - Sub-Thought: If typical_price[t] > typical_price[t-1], positive money flow
      - Sub-Thought: If typical_price[t] < typical_price[t-1], negative money flow
    - Sub-Thought: Compute MFI
      - Sub-Thought: MFI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (positive_money_flow[t] / negative_money_flow[t])))
- Sub-Thought: Interpreting Combined Factors
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate Trend Strength
    - Sub-Thought: Strong Upward Trend (close[t] > open[t] and OBV[t] > OBV[t-1])
    - Sub-Thought: Strong Downward Trend (close[t] < open[t] and OBV[t] < OBV[t-1])
  - Sub-Thought: Assess Market Sentiment
    - Sub-Thought: Bullish Sentiment (MFI > 80)
    - Sub-Thought: Bearish Sentiment (MFI < 20)
- Sub-Thought: Enhance Alpha Factor with Volatility and Volume Adjustments
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Price Range
    - Sub-Thought: (High[t] - Low[t]) / Close[t]
  - Sub-Thought: Compute Volume-Weighted Range
    - Sub-Thought: (Daily Price Range / ((High[t] + Low[t]) / 2)) * sqrt(volume[t])
  - Sub-Thought: Short-Term Rolling Average of Volume-Weighted Range (last 10 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Long-Term Rolling Average of Volume-Weighted Range (last 30 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Combine Price Momentum and Volume-Weighted Range
