  - Cumulative Volume Impact
    - Daily Volume Delta Factor
      - Today's volume minus yesterday's volume
  - Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Calculate the VWAP for each day
      - (Sum of (price * volume) for the day) / (Total volume for the day)
- Analyzing Price Patterns
  - High-Low Range Analysis
    - True Range Calculation
      - Max(high, close_prev) - Min(low, close_prev)
  - Moving Averages
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA)

    - ATR(14): Average of the True Range over the past 14 days
- Order Imbalance Factors
  - Bid-Ask Spread
    - Difference between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price
  - Order Flow Imbalance
    - Sum of the difference between buy and sell order volumes in a given period
- Breakout and Reversal Patterns

    - Plus Directional Indicator (+DI)
      - Positive directional movement divided by the true range
    - Minus Directional Indicator (-DI)
      - Negative directional movement divided by the true range
  - Moving Average Crossover
    - Fast MA (e.g., 5-day) crosses above or below the Slow MA (e.g., 20-day)
- Volume-Based Indicators
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - OBV: Incremental volume on up-days, decremental on down-days
  - Volume Spike
    - Indicator if today's volume is significantly higher than the 20-day average
- Novel Alpha Factors
  - Volume-Weighted Momentum
    - (Today's VWAP - VWAP(n days ago)) / VWAP(n days ago)
  - Price-Volume Divergence
    - Indicator if the price is increasing but the volume is decreasing
  - Volume Acceleration
    - (Today's volume - Volume(n days ago)) / Volume(n days ago)
  - High-Low Ratio
    - (High - Low) / (Close - Open)
  - Close-High Distance
    - (High - Close) / (High - Low)

  - Low-Low Breakdown
    - Indicator if today's low is lower than the lowest low in the past n days
- Advanced Price Patterns
  - Inside Bar
    - Indicator if today's high is lower than the previous day's high and today's low is higher than the previous day's low
  - Outside Bar
    - Indicator if today's high is higher than the previous day's high and today's low is lower than the previous day's low
  - Engulfing Pattern
    - Indicator if today's candle fully engulfs the previous day's candle (either bullish or bearish)
  - Doji Pattern
    - Indicator if today's open and close are nearly equal, creating a doji pattern
- Combined Indicators
  - Momentum-Volume Convergence
    - Indicator if both momentum (e.g., RSI) and volume are increasing
  - Momentum-Volume Divergence
    - Indicator if momentum is increasing but volume is decreasing
  - VWAP-Moving Average Crossover
    - Indicator if VWAP crosses above or below a longer-term moving average
  - Volume-Price Trend
