Thought: Analyze Price Patterns
- Sub-thought: Calculate Moving Averages
  - Sub-thought: Compute the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of close prices for different windows (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days)
  - Sub-thought: Compute the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of close prices for different windows (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days)
- Sub-thought: Identify Crossovers
  - Sub-thought: Determine when the short-term SMA crosses above or below the long-term SMA
  - Sub-thought: Determine when the short-term EMA crosses above or below the long-term EMA
- Sub-thought: Calculate Price Derivatives
  - Sub-thought: Compute the first derivative of close prices (daily change in close price)
  - Sub-thought: Compute the second derivative of close prices (acceleration or deceleration of daily price change)

Thought: Explore Volume and Amount Relationships
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume and Amount Ratios
  - Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of volume to amount traded for each day
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the moving average of the volume-amount ratio over different windows (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days)
- Sub-thought: Identify Volume Spikes
  - Sub-thought: Determine days with unusually high or low volumes compared to the recent average

Thought: Leverage Intraday Price Information
- Sub-thought: Calculate Intraday Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Compute the range (high - low) for each day
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the moving average of the daily range over different windows (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days)
- Sub-thought: Measure Gap Openings
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the current day's open and the previous day's close
  - Sub-thought: Identify significant gap openings (e.g., gaps larger than a certain percentage of the previous day's close)
- Sub-thought: Analyze Intraday Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between the close and open prices (day's net change)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the moving average of the day's net change over different windows (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days)

Thought: Utilize Technical Indicators
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Sub-thought: Compute the RSI using the close prices over a 14-day period
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Sub-thought: Compute the MACD line and signal line using the close prices
  - Sub-thought: Identify crossovers between the MACD line and signal line
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Average True Range (ATR)
  - Sub-thought: Compute the ATR using the high, low, and close prices over a 14-day period
