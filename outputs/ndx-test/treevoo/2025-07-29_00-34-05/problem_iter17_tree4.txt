Synthesized Intraday, Momentum, and Volume Adjustments
├── Calculate Enhanced Intraday Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High

│       └── Average the two results
├── Adjust by Short-Term and Long-Term Momentum
    ├── Short-Term Price Momentum
    │   ├── 5-day EMA of Close
    │   └── 10-day EMA of Close
    │       └── Subtract 10-day EMA from 5-day EMA
    ├── Long-Term Price Momentum
    │   ├── 20-day EMA of Close
    │   └── Subtract 20-day EMA from 10-day EMA
└── Incorporate Volume and Volatility Influence
    ├── Volume Momentum
    │   ├── 5-day Moving Average of Volume
    │   └── 10-day Moving Average of Volume
    │       └── Subtract 10-day Moving Average from 5-day Moving Average
    ├── Daily Range
    │   ├── High price
    │   ├── Low price
    │   └── Subtract Low from High for daily range
    ├── Aggregate 30-day Daily Ranges

    │       └── Previous Volume
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combine Momentum with Volatility and Volume
    │   ├── Multiply Short-Term and Long-Term Price Momentum Difference by inverse of Volatility Score
    │   ├── Multiply result by Volume Acceleration
    └── Divide by (Enhanced Intraday Range * Close)
