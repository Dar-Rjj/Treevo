Volume, Momentum, and Reversal Enhanced Alpha Factor
- Momentum-Based Factors
  - Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages
    - The factor value is the difference between the 50-day and 200-day SMAs
  - Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Measure the percentage change in price over a specified period, such as 12 days
- Reversal-Based Factors
  - Short-Term Overbought/Oversold Indicator
    - Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a lookback period of 14 days
  - High-Low Range Momentum
    - Compute 7-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Daily Price Range
      - Daily Price Range = High price (t) - Low price (t)
      - Use smoothing factor alpha = 2 / (N + 1), N=7
      - Apply EMA formula
    - Calculate Daily Change in EMA
      - Today's EMA - Yesterday's EMA
- Volume-Price Interaction
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Accumulate volume on up-days and subtract it on down-days
  - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Calculate the sum of the Accumulation/Distribution Line values over a 20-period
    - Divide by the total volume over the same period to get the CMF
  - Volume Adjusted Range
    - Multiply (Daily Price Range / Close price) (t)
      - Ensure non-zero division
    - Multiply by Volume (t)
  - Short-Term Rolling Avg of Volume Adjusted Range
    - Sum last 15 days' Volume Adjusted Range and divide by 15
  - Long-Term Rolling Avg of Volume Adjusted Range
    - Sum last 25 days' Volume Adjusted Range and divide by 25
- Hybrid Factors
  - Momentum and Volume Combined
    - Combine the ROC with the CMF to create a hybrid momentum-volume indicator
  - Reversal and Volume Combined
    - Combine the RSI with the OBV to create a hybrid reversal-volume indicator
  - High-Low Range Momentum and Volume Shock
    - Multiply High-Low Range Momentum by Sign of Volume Shock
      - Use Daily Change in EMA
      - Set a threshold for significant volume change, e.g., 60%
      - Flag days with volume changes above the threshold
- Finalize Alpha Factor
  - Use Short-Term Rolling Avg of Volume Adjusted Range
  - Use Long-Term Rolling Avg of Volume Adjusted Range
  - Use Combined Indicators
  - Adjust for Price Volatility
    - Price Volatility = Standard Deviation of Close prices (last 30 days)
  - Multiply by Trade Amount Influence (t)
