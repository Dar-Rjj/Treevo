Alpha Mining for Stock Returns Prediction with Enhanced Intraday, Momentum, and Volume Adjustments
- Momentum-Based Factors
  - Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages
    - The factor value is the difference between the 50-day and 200-day SMAs
  - Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Measure the percentage change in price over a specified period, such as 12 days
  - Short-Term Price Momentum
    - 5-day EMA of Close
    - 10-day EMA of Close
    - Subtract 10-day EMA from 5-day EMA
  - Long-Term Price Momentum
    - 20-day EMA of Close
    - Subtract 20-day EMA from 5-day EMA
- Reversal-Based Factors
  - Short-Term Overbought/Oversold Indicator
    - Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a lookback period of 14 days
  - Extreme Price Movements
    - Identify days where the close-to-open ratio is significantly above or below the average
- Volume-Price Interaction
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Accumulate volume on up-days and subtract it on down-days
  - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Calculate the sum of the Accumulation/Distribution Line values over a 20-period
    - Divide by the total volume over the same period to get the CMF
  - 5-day Moving Average of Volume
  - 10-day Moving Average of Volume
  - Volume Deviation Score
    - Subtract 10-day Moving Average from 5-day Moving Average
    - Percentage Change in Volume for 5 days
      - Current Volume
      - Previous Volume
- Volume and Amount-Based Factors
  - Volume Breakout
    - Identify significant volume spikes compared to the 30-day average volume
  - Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Calculate the VWAP for each day
  - Volume-Price Correlation
    - Compute the correlation between daily price changes and volume
- Hybrid Factors
  - Momentum and Volume Combined
    - Combine the ROC with the CMF to create a hybrid momentum-volume indicator
  - Reversal and Volume Combined
    - Combine the RSI with the OBV to create a hybrid reversal-volume indicator
- Enhanced Intraday Range
  - Subtract Low from High
  - Subtract Open from Close
  - Average the two results
- Volatility Adjustment
  - Daily Range
    - High price
    - Low price
    - Subtract Low from High for daily range
  - Aggregate 30-day Daily Ranges
    - Sum of daily ranges over 30 days
    - Compute average range volatility
- New Factor: Price-Volatility Ratio
  - Compute the ratio of Close to Volatility
- New Factor: Volume-Adjusted Momentum
  - Calculate the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages
  - The factor value is the difference between the 50-day and 200-day SMAs
  - Multiply the momentum difference by the CMF
- Combine Factors
  - Adjust Momentum by Volatility
    - Multiply Momentum Difference by inverse of Volatility Score
  - Adjust by Volume Acceleration
    - Multiply result by Volume Deviation Score
  - Final Alpha Factor
    - Add Volume-Adjusted Momentum to the adjusted momentum
    - Divide by (Enhanced Intraday Range * Close)
    - Multiply by Price-Volatility Ratio
