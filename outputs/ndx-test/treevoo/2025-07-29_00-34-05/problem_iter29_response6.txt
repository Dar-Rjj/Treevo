```python
import pandas as pd

def heuristics_v2(df):
    """
    This function generates a novel alpha factor based on the thought tree.
    
    The alpha factor is computed as follows:
    1. Calculate the difference between the high and low prices (True Range).
    2. Calculate the percentage change in volume compared to the previous day.
    3. Calculate the directional movement by comparing the current close price to the previous close price.
    4. Combine these three components to form the final alpha factor.
    
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with columns ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'] indexed by date.
    
    Returns:
    pd.Series: A Series representing the alpha factor values, indexed by date.

    # 3. Directional movement
