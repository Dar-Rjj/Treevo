- Momentum-Based Factors
  - Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages
    - The factor value is the difference between the 50-day and 200-day SMAs
  - Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Measure the percentage change in price over a specified period, such as 12 days
  - Exponential Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate the 10-day and 30-day exponential moving averages
    - The factor value is the difference between the 10-day and 30-day EMAs
- Reversal-Based Factors
  - Short-Term Overbought/Oversold Indicator
    - Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a lookback period of 14 days
  - Extreme Price Movements
    - Identify days where the close-to-open ratio is significantly above or below the average
  - Stochastic Oscillator
    - Calculate the %K and %D lines over a 14-day period
    - The factor value is the %D line
- Volume-Price Interaction
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Accumulate volume on up-days and subtract it on down-days
  - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Calculate the sum of the Accumulation/Distribution Line values over a 20-period
    - Divide by the total volume over the same period to get the CMF
  - Money Flow Index (MFI)
    - Calculate the MFI over a 14-day period
    - The factor value is the MFI

    - Calculate the VWAP for each day
  - Volume-Price Correlation
    - Compute the correlation between daily price changes and volume
- Hybrid Factors
  - Momentum and Volume Combined
    - Combine the ROC with the CMF to create a hybrid momentum-volume indicator
  - Reversal and Volume Combined
    - Combine the RSI with the OBV to create a hybrid reversal-volume indicator
  - Momentum, Reversal, and Volume-Price Efficiency Combined
    - Combine the ROC, RSI, CMF, and Volume-Efficiency Ratio into a single indicator
- Enhanced Hybrid Factors
  - Momentum, Reversal, and Volume Combined
    - Combine the ROC, RSI, and CMF to create a comprehensive hybrid indicator
  - Volume-Price Correlation and SMA Crossover
    - Combine the Volume-Price Correlation with the 50-day and 200-day SMA crossover
- Advanced Volume-Based Indicators
  - Volume Spike Detection
    - Identify days with unusually high volume compared to the 60-day average volume
  - Volume-Weighted Close
    - Calculate the volume-weighted close price for each day
  - Volume Rate of Change (VROC)
    - Measure the percentage change in volume over a specified period, such as 14 days
- Advanced Momentum and Reversal Indicators
  - Long-Term ROC
    - Measure the percentage change in price over a long-term period, such as 252 days
  - Adaptive RSI
    - Use an adaptive RSI that adjusts the lookback period based on recent volatility
  - Bollinger Bands Width
    - Calculate the Bollinger Bands width over a 20-day period
    - The factor value is the width of the Bollinger Bands
- Advanced Volume-Price Interaction
  - Accumulation/Distribution Line
    - Calculate the Accumulation/Distribution Line based on the day's close relative to the high-low range
  - Volume-Efficiency Ratio
    - Compute the efficiency ratio of price changes to volume
  - Negative Volume Index (NVI)
    - Calculate the NVI which tracks price changes only when volume decreases
- Advanced Hybrid Indicators
  - Integrated Momentum, Reversal, and Volume-Price Efficiency
    - Combine the ROC, RSI, CMF, and Volume-Efficiency Ratio into a single indicator
  - Dynamic Momentum and Reversal with Volume-Weighted Close
    - Combine the Long-Term ROC, Adaptive RSI, and Volume-Weighted Close
