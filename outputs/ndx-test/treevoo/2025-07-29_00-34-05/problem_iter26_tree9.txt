Integrated Momentum, Reversal, and Volume Indicators with Enhanced Intraday Interactions
- Momentum-Based Factors
  - Simple Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculate the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages
    - The factor value is the difference between the 50-day and 200-day SMAs
  - Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Measure the percentage change in price over a specified period, such as 12 days
- Reversal-Based Factors
  - Short-Term Overbought/Oversold Indicator
    - Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a lookback period of 14 days
  - High-Low Range Momentum
    - Compute 7-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Daily Price Range
      - Daily Price Range = High price (t) - Low price (t)
      - Use smoothing factor alpha = 2 / (N + 1), N=7
      - Apply EMA formula
    - Calculate Daily Change in EMA
      - Today's EMA - Yesterday's EMA
- Volume-Price Interaction
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Accumulate volume on up-days and subtract it on down-days
  - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Calculate the sum of the Accumulation/Distribution Line values over a 20-period
    - Divide by the total volume over the same period to get the CMF
  - Volume Adjusted Range
    - Multiply (Daily Price Range / Close price) (t)
      - Ensure non-zero division
    - Multiply by Volume (t)
  - Short-Term Rolling Avg of Volume Adjusted Range
    - Sum last 10 days' Volume Adjusted Range and divide by 10
  - Long-Term Rolling Avg of Volume Adjusted Range
    - Sum last 20 days' Volume Adjusted Range and divide by 20
- Hybrid Factors
  - Momentum and Volume Combined
    - Combine the ROC with the CMF to create a hybrid momentum-volume indicator
  - Reversal and Volume Combined
    - Combine the RSI with the OBV to create a hybrid reversal-volume indicator
  - High-Low Range Momentum and Volume Shock
    - Multiply High-Low Range Momentum by Sign of Volume Shock
      - Use Daily Change in EMA
      - Set a threshold for significant volume change, e.g., 60%
      - Flag days with volume changes above the threshold
- Intraday Measures
  - Calculate Daily Price Range
    - Use High price
    - Use Low price
  - Calculate Average Price
    - Add (High + Low + Close)
    - Divide by 3
  - Compute Volume Adjusted Range
    - Multiply (Daily Price Range / Average Price)
      - Ensure non-zero division
    - Multiply by Volume
  - Combine Intraday Measures
    - Add Intraday High-Low Spread and Close-Open Difference
    - Multiply by Volume
- Short-Term and Long-Term Price Momentum
  - Short-Term Price Momentum
    - Daily Price Change
      - Use Close price
      - Subtract Previous Day's Close price
    - Compute 5-day EMA and 10-day EMA
      - Subtract 10-day EMA from 5-day EMA
  - Long-Term Price Momentum
    - Daily Price Change
      - Use Close price
      - Subtract Previous Day's Close price
    - Moving Average of Daily Price Changes
      - Compute 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
      - Compute 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
      - Subtract 50-day SMA from 20-day SMA
- Volume Indicator
  - Volume Change
    - Use Volume
    - Subtract Previous Day's Volume
  - Positive Volume Days
    - Over the Last 20 Days
  - Negative Volume Days
    - Over the Last 20 Days
- Final Factor Adjustment
  - Calculate Volume Momentum
    - Use Volume
      - Calculate 5-day EMA
    - Use Volume
      - Calculate 10-day EMA
      - Subtract 10-day EMA from 5-day EMA
  - Multiply Short-Term Price Momentum by Volume Momentum
  - Divide the result by Combined Intraday Measure
- Combine Momentum, Volume, and High-Low Range
  - Multiply Short-Term Price Momentum by Volume Momentum
  - Multiply the result by High-Low Range Factor
  - Use Close price
    - Divide the result by Close price
- Combine Factors
  - Add Short-Term Rolling Average of Volume Adjusted Range
  - Subtract Long-Term Rolling Average of Volume Adjusted Range
  - Add Final Factor Adjustment
- Final
