Thought: Create a Momentum Indicator
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Rate of Change (ROC) for 12 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Use closing prices to find ROC
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Smoothed ROC over 25 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Apply a simple moving average (SMA) on the 12-day ROC
- Sub-thought: Determine the Momentum Signal
-- Sub-sub-thought: If the smoothed ROC is positive, signal = 1, else signal = -1

Thought: Develop a Volume-based Strength Indicator
- Sub-thought: Compute the Volume Moving Average (VMA) for 20 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Use volume data to calculate VMA
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Volume Ratio
-- Sub-sub-thought: Divide the current day's volume by the 20-day VMA
- Sub-thought: Assign a Volume Score
-- Sub-sub-thought: If the Volume Ratio > 1, score = 1, if equal = 0, otherwise score = -1

Thought: Construct a Price Volatility Indicator
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Daily Range
-- Sub-sub-thought: Subtract the low from the high for each day
- Sub-thought: Compute the Average True Range (ATR) over 14 days
-- Sub-sub-thought: Use the daily range to estimate ATR
- Sub-thought: Analyze the ATR Trend
-- Sub-sub-thought: Compare the current ATR with the previous day's ATR
--- Sub-sub-sub-thought: If current ATR > previous ATR, trend = 1, else trend = -1

Thought: Formulate a Money Flow Index (MFI)
- Sub-thought: Calculate Typical Price
-- Sub-sub-thought: (High + Low + Close) / 3
- Sub-thought: Determine Positive and Negative Money Flow
-- Sub-sub-thought: If today's typical price > yesterday's, it's positive flow, otherwise negative
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Money Flow Ratio
-- Sub-sub-thought: Sum of positive money flow / sum of negative money flow for 14 days
- Sub-thought: Compute MFI
-- Sub-sub-thought: 100 - (100 / (1 + Money Flow Ratio))
- Sub-thought: Interpret MFI
-- Sub-sub-thought: If MFI < 20, condition = oversold; if MFI > 80, condition = overbought; else neutral

Thought: Design an Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Money Flow Multiplier
-- Sub-sub-thought: ((Close - Low) - (High - Close)) / (High - Low)
- Sub-thought: Update the A/D Line
-- Sub-sub-thought: Add the Money Flow Multiplier multiplied by the period's volume to the previous A/D Line
- Sub-thought: Analyze the A/D Line Trend
-- Sub-sub-thought: If the A/D Line is rising, market accumulation; if falling, distribution
