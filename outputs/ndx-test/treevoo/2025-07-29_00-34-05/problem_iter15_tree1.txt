Alpha Mining for Stock Returns Prediction
- Alpha Factor Generation Based on Price Data
  - Momentum-Based Factors
    - Simple Moving Average Crossover
      - Calculate the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages
      - The factor value is the difference between the 50-day and 200-day SMAs
    - Rate of Change (ROC)
      - Measure the percentage change in price over a specified period, such as 12 days
  - Reversal-Based Factors
    - Short-Term Overbought/Oversold Indicator
      - Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a lookback period of 14 days
      - The factor captures potential short-term mean reversion
    - Extreme Price Movements
      - Identify days where the close-to-open ratio is significantly above or below the average
      - This could signal a potential reversal
  - Volume-Price Interaction
    - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
      - Accumulate volume on up-days and subtract it on down-days
      - Consider the OBV trend as an indicator of buying/selling pressure
    - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
      - Calculate the sum of the Accumulation/Distribution Line values over a 20-period
      - Divide by the total volume over the same period to get the CMF
- Alpha Factor Generation Based on Volume and Amount
  - Volume Breakout
    - Identify significant volume spikes compared to the 30-day average volume
    - This may indicate strong interest or a potential breakout
  - Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Calculate the VWAP for each day
    - Use the VWAP as a reference level to identify trends
  - Volume-Price Correlation
    - Compute the correlation between daily price changes and volume
    - A high positive correlation may indicate strong price momentum
- Hybrid Factors
  - Momentum and Volume Combined
    - Combine the ROC with the CMF to create a hybrid momentum-volume indicator
    - This factor aims to capture both price and volume dynamics
  - Reversal and Volume Combined
    - Combine the RSI with the OBV to create a hybrid reversal-volume indicator
    - This factor aims to capture potential reversals supported by volume activity
