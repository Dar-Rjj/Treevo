- Exploring Volume-Price Relationship
  - Cumulative Volume Impact
    - Daily Volume Delta Factor
      - Today's volume minus yesterday's volume
  - Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Calculate the VWAP for each day
      - (Sum of (price * volume) for the day) / (Total volume for the day)
- Analyzing Price Patterns
  - High-Low Range Analysis
    - True Range Calculation
      - Max(high, close_prev) - Min(low, close_prev)
  - Moving Averages
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
      - SMA(5): Average of the last 5 closing prices
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
      - EMA(10): Exponential moving average with a span of 10 days
- Momentum and Volatility Indicators
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - RSI(14): Measure of the stock's recent gains versus losses over the past 14 days
  - Average True Range (ATR)
    - ATR(14): Average of the True Range over the past 14 days
- Order Imbalance Factors
  - Bid-Ask Spread
    - Difference between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price
  - Order Flow Imbalance
    - Sum of the difference between buy and sell order volumes in a given period
- Breakout and Reversal Patterns
  - New High or Low
    - Indicator if today's high is higher than the previous 20-day high
  - Price Reversal
    - Indicator if the price crosses above the 50-day moving average
- Trend Following Indicators
  - Directional Movement
    - Plus Directional Indicator (+DI)
      - Positive directional movement divided by the true range
    - Minus Directional Indicator (-DI)
      - Negative directional movement divided by the true range
  - Moving Average Crossover
    - Fast MA (e.g., 5-day) crosses above or below the Slow MA (e.g., 20-day)
- Volume-Based Indicators
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - OBV: Incremental volume on up-days, decremental on down-days
  - Volume Spike
    - Indicator if today's volume is significantly higher than the 20-day average
- Novel Alpha Factors
  - Volume-Weighted Return
    - (Close - Open) * Volume
  - Price-Oscillation Factor
    - (High - Low) / (High + Low)
  - Volume-Adjusted True Range
    - True Range * (Volume / Average Volume over 20 days)
  - Accumulation-Distribution Line
    - Cumulative sum of (Close - (High + Low) / 2) * Volume
  - Volume-Weighted Momentum
    - (Close - Close 10 days ago) * Volume
