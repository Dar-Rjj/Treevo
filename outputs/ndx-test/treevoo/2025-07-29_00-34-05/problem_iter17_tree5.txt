Alpha Mining for Stock Returns Prediction with Enhanced Intraday and Momentum Indicators
- Alpha Factor Generation Based on Price Data
  - Momentum-Based Factors
    - Simple Moving Average Crossover
      - Calculate the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages
      - The factor value is the difference between the 50-day and 200-day SMAs
    - Rate of Change (ROC)
      - Measure the percentage change in price over a specified period, such as 12 days
    - Enhanced Intraday Range
      - Subtract Low from High
      - Subtract Open from Close
      - Average the two results
      - Adjust by Short-Term Momentum and Volume Trend
        - Short-Term Price Momentum
          - 5-day EMA of High
          - 10-day EMA of Low
          - Subtract 10-day EMA from 5-day EMA
        - Volume Momentum
          - 5-day Sum of Volume
          - 10-day Sum of Volume
          - Subtract 10-day Sum from 5-day Sum
        - Final Factor
          - Multiply Short-Term Price Momentum by Volume Momentum
          - Divide by (Enhanced Intraday Range * Total Amount)
  - Reversal-Based Factors
    - Short-Term Overbought/Oversold Indicator
      - Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a lookback period of 14 days
      - The factor captures potential short-term mean reversion
    - Extreme Price Movements
      - Identify days where the close-to-open ratio is significantly above or below the average
      - This could signal a potential reversal
- Alpha Factor Generation Based on Volume and Amount
  - Volume-Price Interaction
    - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
      - Accumulate volume on up-days and subtract it on down-days
      - Consider the OBV trend as an indicator of buying/selling pressure
    - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
      - Calculate the sum of the Accumulation/Distribution Line values over a 20-period
      - Divide by the total volume over the same period to get the CMF
    - Volume Breakout
      - Identify significant volume spikes compared to the 30-day average volume
      - This may indicate strong interest or a potential breakout
    - Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
      - Calculate the VWAP for each day
      - Use the VWAP as a reference level to identify trends
    - Volume-Price Correlation
      - Compute the correlation between daily price changes and volume
      - A high positive correlation may indicate strong price momentum
    - Volume Impact Factor
      - Use Volume (t)
      - Average Volume (last 30 days)
    - Trade Amount Influence
      - Use Amount (t)
      - Average Amount (last 30 days)
- Hybrid Factors
  - Momentum and Volume Combined
    - Combine the ROC with the CMF to create a hybrid momentum-volume indicator
    - This factor aims to capture both price and volume dynamics
    - Calculate Momentum
      - Use Close price (t)
      - Subtract Close price (t-20)
    - Combine Momentum and Volume Impact
      - Momentum (t)
      - Divide by Volume Impact Factor (t)
    - Adjust for Price Volatility
      - Combined Momentum and Volume (t)
      - Divide by Price Volatility (last 30 days)
  - Reversal and Volume Combined
    - Combine the RSI with the OBV to create a hybrid reversal-volume indicator
    - This factor aims to capture potential reversals supported by volume activity
  - High-Low Range and Volume Shock Combined
    - Calculate High-Low Range
      - Use High price (t)
      - Use Low price (t)
    - Calculate High-Low Range Momentum
      - Compute 7-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of High-Low Range
      - Apply EMA formula
      - Calculate Daily Change in EMA
        - Use today's EMA
        - Use yesterday's EMA
    - Calculate Volume Shock
      - Compute Volume Percentage Change
        - Use today's Volume
        - Use yesterday's Volume
      - Identify Significant Volume Changes
        - Set a threshold for significant volume change, e.g., 60%
        - Flag days with volume changes above the threshold
    - Combine Indicators
      - Multiply High-Low Range Momentum by Sign of Volume Shock
        - Use Daily Change in EMA
        - Use Flags from Volume Shock
      - Generate Combined Indicator
  - Volume Adjusted Range
    - Calculate Daily Price Range
      - Use High price (t)
      - Use Low price (t)
    - Calculate Average Price
      - Add (High + Low + Close) (t)
