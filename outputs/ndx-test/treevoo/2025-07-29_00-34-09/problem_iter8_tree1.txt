Dynamic Volume- and Amount-Adjusted Relative Strength Index with Exponential Smoothing
├── Calculate Daily Adjusted Return
│   ├── Calculate Logarithmic Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Adjust by Previous Day's High and Low
│       ├── Subtract yesterday's low from today's close
│       ├── Divide by (yesterday's high - yesterday's low)
│       └── Multiply by 100 to get percentage
├── Apply Volume and Amount Smoothing
│   ├── Calculate 7-Day Exponentially Weighted Moving Average of Volumes
│   │   ├── Assign weights exponentially (higher weight for recent days)
│   │   └── Sum the weighted volumes over the last 7 days
│   ├── Calculate 7-Day Exponentially Weighted Moving Average of Amounts
│   │   ├── Assign weights exponentially (higher weight for recent days)
│   │   └── Sum the weighted amounts over the last 7 days
│   └── Normalize Today's Volume and Amount by 7-Day Exponentially Weighted Averages
│       ├── Divide today's volume by 7-day exponentially weighted moving average of volumes
│       └── Divide today's amount by 7-day exponentially weighted moving average of amounts
├── Weighted Returns Calculation
│   ├── Multiply Adjusted Return by Normalized Volume and Amount
│   │   ├── Multiply Adjusted Return by Normalized Volume
│   │   └── Multiply result by Normalized Amount
│   └── Sum Over 14 Days
├── Separate Positive and Negative Weights
│   ├── Calculate Positive Weighted Returns
│   │   ├── Filter for positive weighted returns
│   │   └── Sum over 14 days
│   └── Calculate Negative Weighted Returns
│       ├── Filter for negative weighted returns
│       └── Sum absolute values over 14 days
├── Compute Dynamic RSI
│   ├── Calculate Relative Strength
│   │   ├── Divide Sum of Positive Weighted Returns
│   │   └── by Sum of Absolute Negative Weighted Returns
│   └── Transform to Dynamic RSI
│       ├── Use the formula: 100 - (100 / (1 + Relative Strength))
└── Interpret Factor
    ├── High Dynamic RSI indicates overbought, low Dynamic RSI indicates oversold
    └── Use as a predictive signal for future stock returns
