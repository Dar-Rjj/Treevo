Thought: Exploring Momentum and Reversion Factors Using Price Data
    Thought: Calculate 10-day simple moving average (SMA) of the close price to identify short-term trends
        Thought: Define a momentum factor as the difference between the current close price and the 10-day SMA
            Thought: Use the sign of the momentum factor to predict continuation or reversal, assuming positive values indicate continuation and negative values suggest reversion
    Thought: Utilize volume data to identify significant trading activity days
        Thought: Define high-activity days as those where the volume is above its 30-day simple moving average
            Thought: On high-activity days, calculate the percentage change in the closing price from the previous day
                Thought: Adjust the momentum score based on the percentage change: increase if positive, decrease if negative
    Thought: Incorporate the open, high, low, and close prices to measure intraday market sentiment
        Thought: Calculate the daily price range (high - low)
            Thought: Compare the daily close with the midpoint of the daily range (average of high and low)
                Thought: Determine directional bias: bullish if close is above midpoint, bearish if below
                    Thought: Combine the directional bias with the volume-based momentum adjustment to create a composite sentiment-adjusted momentum signal
                        Thought: Output the final composite sentiment-adjusted momentum score for each day to predict the stock's potential direction
