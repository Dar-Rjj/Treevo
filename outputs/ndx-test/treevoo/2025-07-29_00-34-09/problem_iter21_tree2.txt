Thought: Enhancing Momentum and Reversion Strategies with Price and Volume Data
    Thought: Calculate 10-day simple moving average (SMA) of the close price to identify short-term trends
        Thought: Define a momentum factor as the difference between the current close price and the 10-day SMA
            Thought: Use the sign of the momentum factor to predict continuation or reversal, assuming positive values indicate continuation and negative values suggest reversion
    Thought: Utilize volume data to identify significant trading activity days
        Thought: Define high-activity days as those where the volume is above its 30-day simple moving average
            Thought: On high-activity days, calculate the percentage change in the closing price from the previous day
                Thought: If this percentage change is positive, increase the momentum score; if negative, decrease it, adjusting the expected future return direction
    Thought: Incorporate the open, high, low, and close prices to measure intraday market sentiment
        Thought: Calculate the daily price range (high - low)
            Thought: Compare the daily close with the midpoint of the daily range (average of high and low)
                Thought: If the close is above the midpoint, interpret it as bullishness for the next period; if below, bearishness. This forms a directional bias indicator.
                    Thought: Combine the directional bias indicator with the volume-based momentum adjustment to create a composite sentiment-adjusted momentum signal
                        Thought: For each day, output the final composite sentiment-adjusted momentum score to predict the stock's potential direction
                            Thought: Introduce a volatility component by calculating the average true range (ATR) over the last 10 days
                                Thought: Adjust the composite sentiment-adjusted momentum score by multiplying it with the ATR to incorporate volatility, enhancing the predictive power
                                    Thought: On high-volatility days, amplify the momentum signal; on low-volatility days, dampen the momentum signal
                                        Thought: Finalize the enhanced momentum score, incorporating both sentiment and volatility, to predict the stock's potential direction
    Thought: Incorporate a trend-following element using the 50-day and 200-day SMAs
        Thought: Calculate the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA of the close price
            Thought: Define a long-term trend factor as the difference between the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA
                Thought: Use the sign of the long-term trend factor to determine the overall trend direction
                    Thought: If the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, it indicates a bullish trend; if below, a bearish trend
                        Thought: Adjust the final momentum score based on the long-term trend direction
                            Thought: In a bullish trend, increase the momentum score; in a bearish trend, decrease it
                                Thought: Finalize the adjusted momentum score, incorporating both short-term and long-term trend information, to predict the stock's potential direction
