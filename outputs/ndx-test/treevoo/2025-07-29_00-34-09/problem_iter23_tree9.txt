├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   └── (High - Low) / Low
├── Integrate Intraday and Multi-Day Momentum
│   ├── (High - Low) / Low * Volume / (High + Low)
│   ├── 5-Day Average Sequential Momentum: Sum((Close - Previous Close) / Previous Close) / 5
│   └── (Intraday Momentum * 5-Day Average Amount) + (Sustained 5-Day Momentum * Volume)
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   └── (Close - Open)
├── Compute 5-Day and 10-Day EMAs of Price Change
│   └── Use the last 5 days' and 10 days' price changes to calculate EMAs
├── Determine Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 10-Day EMAs
│   │   ├── If 5-Day EMA crosses below 10-Day EMA, signal a bearish trend
│   │   └── If 5-Day EMA crosses above 10-Day EMA, signal a bullish trend
│   └── Consider 14-day Rolling Median of High-to-Low Range
│       ├── If high, amplify the reversal signal
│       └── If low, dampen the reversal signal
├── Filter by Volume
    └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
├── Calculate Cumulative Weighted Momentum
│   └── Sum(Weighted Daily Return Over Last 5 Days) / 5-Day Average Amount
├── Incorporate Volatility into Alpha Factor
│   ├── 21-Day Historical Volatility: Standard Deviation of last 21 days' Close prices
│   └── Final Alpha Factor * (1 / 21-Day Historical Volatility)
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Price (VAP)
│   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices to calculate Typical Price
│   └── Weight Typical Price by Volume
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VAP
│   │   ├── Use VAP for EMA calculation
│   └── Subtract 20-day EMA from current VAP
├── Incorporate Recent Volatility

│   │   ├── Daily Returns Calculation
│   │   │   ├── Use Adjacent Close Prices

    ├── Compute 30-Day Rolling Window of High-Low Range
    │   ├── Use 30-day window for high-low range
    └── Compute 30-Day Moving Standard Deviation of High-Low Ranges
    │   ├── Use 30-day window for standard deviation
    └── Combine with Existing Volatility Measures
        ├── Average of 20-Day and 30-Day High-Low Range Volatilities
        └── Use this average in the final composite volatility calculation
├── Calculate 5-Day Price Range
    ├── Use High and Low prices of the last 5 days
    └── Calculate the difference between the highest high and lowest low
├── Incorporate 5-Day Price Range into Momentum
    ├── Normalize 5-Day Price Range
    │   ├── Divide by the average of the 5-day High and Low prices
    └── Multiply the normalized 5-Day Price Range by the Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── Calculate 10-Day Price Range
    ├── Use High and Low prices of the last 10 days
    └── Calculate the difference between the highest high and lowest low
├── Incorporate 10-Day Price Range into Momentum
