Crossover of Enhanced Momentum, Price Range Volatility, and Volume-Adjusted Price Movement with Sentiment and Reversal Signals
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t
│       ├── Subtract Open from Close to get daily change
├── Compute 5-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Price Change
│   ├── Use the last 5 days' price changes
│   └── Calculate the EMA
├── Compute 10-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Price Change
│   ├── Use the last 10 days' price changes
│   └── Calculate the EMA
├── Determine Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 10-Day EMAs
│   │   ├── If 5-Day EMA crosses below 10-Day EMA, signal a bearish trend
│   │   └── If 5-Day EMA crosses above 10-Day EMA, signal a bullish trend
├── Filter by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
│       ├── This ensures that the signal is significant
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Price (VAP)
│   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices to calculate Typical Price
│   └── Weight Typical Price by Volume
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Price Movement
│   ├── Compute Daily Log Returns
│   │   ├── Close price of day t
│   │   └── Close price of previous day (t-1)
│   ├── 20-Day EMA of Log Returns
│   │   └── Weigh by Volume
│   │       └── Volume of day t
│   └── Weight by High-Low Range Volatility
│       ├── Daily High-Low Range
│       │   ├── High price of day t
│       │   └── Low price of day t
│       └── 20-Day Moving SD of High-Low Ranges
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VAP
│   │   ├── Use VAP for EMA calculation
│   └── Subtract 20-day EMA from current VAP
│       ├── Current VAP value
│       └── 20-day EMA of VAP
├── Incorporate Recent Volatility
│   ├── Compute 10-day Standard Deviation of daily returns
│   │   ├── Daily Returns Calculation
│   │   │   ├── Use Adjacent Close Prices
│   │   └── Calculate Standard Deviation
│   └── Multiply Momentum by Inverse of Volatility
│       ├── Invert the 10-day Volatility
│       └── Multiply Momentum by this value
├── Calculate High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Compute 20-Day Moving Standard Deviation of High-Low Ranges
│       ├── Use 20-day window for standard deviation
├── Calculate Open-Close Range Volatility
    ├── Compute 20-Day Moving Standard Deviation of Open-Close Ranges
└── Combine Crossover Momentum and Composite Volatility
    ├── Use Raw Value of Volume Adjusted Momentum
    └── Subtract Average of High-Low and Open-Close Range Volatilities
├── Enhance with Additional Volatility Measure
    ├── Compute 30-Day Rolling Window of High-Low Range
    │   ├── Use 30-day window for high-low range
    └── Compute 30-Day Moving Standard Deviation of High-Low Ranges
    │   ├── Use 30-day window for standard deviation
    └── Combine with Existing Volatility Measures
        ├── Average of 20-Day and 30-Day High-Low Range Volatilities
        └── Use this average in the final composite volatility calculation
├── Calculate 5-Day Price Range
    ├── Use High and Low prices of the last 5 days
    └── Calculate the difference between the highest high and lowest low
├── Incorporate 5-Day Price Range into Momentum
    ├── Normalize 5-Day Price Range
    │   ├── Divide by the average of the 5-day High and Low prices
    └── Multiply the normalized 5-Day Price Range by the Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── Calculate 10-Day Price Range
    ├── Use High and Low prices of the last 10 days
    └── Calculate the difference between the highest high and lowest low
├── Incorporate 10-Day Price Range into Momentum
    ├── Normalize 10-Day Price Range
