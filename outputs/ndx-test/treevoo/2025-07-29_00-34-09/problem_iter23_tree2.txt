Thought: Synthesized Enhanced Momentum and Reversion Strategies with Volume-Adjusted Price and Composite Volatility
    Thought: Calculate 10-day simple moving average (SMA) of the close price to identify short-term trends
        Thought: Define a momentum factor as the difference between the current close price and the 10-day SMA
            Thought: Use the sign of the momentum factor to predict continuation or reversal, assuming positive values indicate continuation and negative values suggest reversion
    Thought: Utilize volume data to identify significant trading activity days
        Thought: Define high-activity days as those where the volume is above its 30-day simple moving average
            Thought: On high-activity days, calculate the percentage change in the closing price from the previous day
                Thought: If this percentage change is positive, increase the momentum score; if negative, decrease it, adjusting the expected future return direction
    Thought: Incorporate the open, high, low, and close prices to measure intraday market sentiment
        Thought: Calculate the daily price range (high - low)
            Thought: Compare the daily close with the midpoint of the daily range (average of high and low)
                Thought: If the close is above the midpoint, interpret it as bullishness for the next period; if below, bearishness. This forms a directional bias indicator.
                    Thought: Combine the directional bias indicator with the volume-based momentum adjustment to create a composite sentiment-adjusted momentum signal
                        Thought: For each day, output the final composite sentiment-adjusted momentum score to predict the stock's potential direction
                            Thought: Introduce a volatility component by calculating the average true range (ATR) over the last 10 days
                                Thought: Adjust the composite sentiment-adjusted momentum score by multiplying it with the ATR to incorporate volatility, enhancing the predictive power
                                    Thought: On high-volatility days, amplify the momentum signal; on low-volatility days, dampen the momentum signal
                                        Thought: Finalize the enhanced momentum score, incorporating both sentiment and volatility, to predict the stock's potential direction
    Thought: Incorporate a trend-following element using the 50-day and 200-day SMAs
        Thought: Calculate the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA of the close price
            Thought: Define a long-term trend factor as the difference between the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA
                Thought: Use the sign of the long-term trend factor to determine the overall trend direction
                    Thought: If the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, it indicates a bullish trend; if below, a bearish trend
                        Thought: Adjust the final momentum score based on the long-term trend direction
                            Thought: In a bullish trend, increase the momentum score; in a bearish trend, decrease it
                                Thought: Finalize the adjusted momentum score, incorporating both short-term and long-term trend information, to predict the stock's potential direction
    Thought: Calculate Volume-Weighted Price (VWP)
        Thought: (High Price * Volume + Low Price * Volume) / (2 * Volume)
    Thought: Assess Intraday Volatility
        Thought: Absolute Intraday Range
            Thought: High Price - Low Price
        Thought: Adjust for Median Volume
            Thought: Absolute Intraday Range / Median Volume over the Last 14 Days
        Thought: Generate Intraday Volatility Metric
    Thought: Integrate High-to-Low Range Momentum
        Thought: Rolling 20-Day High-to-Low Range Sum
            Thought: Sum of the Last 20 Days' (High Price - Low Price)
        Thought: Difference between Consecutive VWP
        Thought: Adjust by Intraday Volatility and 20-Day High-to-Low Range Sum
    Thought: Calculate Volume-Adjusted Momentum
        Thought: 25-day EMA of VWP
        Thought: Subtract 25-day EMA from current VWP
    Thought: Incorporate Recent Volatility
        Thought: 15-day Standard Deviation of daily returns
            Thought: Daily Returns Calculation
            Thought: Calculate Standard Deviation
        Thought: Multiply Momentum by Inverse of Volatility
    Thought: Calculate High-Low Range Volatility
        Thought: Daily High-Low Range
            Thought: High price - Low price
        Thought: 30-Day Moving Average of High-Low Ranges
    Thought: Calculate Open-Close Range Volatility
        Thought: Daily Open-Close Range
            Thought: Open price - Close price
        Thought: 30-Day Moving Average of Open-Close Ranges
    Thought: Combine Volume-Adjusted Momentum and Enhanced Composite Volatility
        Thought: Use Raw Value of Volume-Adjusted Momentum
        Thought: Subtract Weighted Average of High-Low and Open-Close Range Averages
