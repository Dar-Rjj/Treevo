Synthesized Intraday and Multi-Day Momentum with Trend Reversal, Volume-Adjusted Price, and Composite Volatility Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Price (VWP) with High and Low Prices
│   └── Adjusted Volume-Weighted Price: (High Price * Volume + Low Price * Volume) / (2 * Volume)
├── Assess Intraday Volatility through Range and Volume
│   ├── Calculate Absolute Intraday Range: High Price - Low Price
│   ├── Adjust for Average Volume over Period: Absolute Intraday Range / Average Volume over the Last 14 Days
│   └── Generate Intraday Volatility Metric
├── Integrate High-to-Low Range Momentum into Alpha Factor
│   ├── Calculate Rolling 14-Day High-to-Low Range Average: Average of the Last 14 Days' (High Price - Low Price)
│   ├── Combine Metrics: Volume-Weighted Price and Momentum
│   │   ├── Difference between Consecutive Volume-Weighted Prices
│   │   └── Adjust by Both Intraday Volatility and 14-Day High-to-Low Range
│   └── Final Alpha Factor Adjustment
│       ├── Multiply Difference by Intraday Volatility
│       └── Further Modulate by 14-Day High-to-Low Range Average
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWP
│   │   └── Use VWP for EMA calculation
│   └── Subtract 20-day EMA from current VWP
│       ├── Current VWP value
│       └── 20-day EMA of VWP
├── Incorporate Recent Volatility
│   ├── Compute 10-day Standard Deviation of daily returns
│   │   ├── Daily Returns Calculation: Use Adjacent Close Prices
│   │   └── Calculate Standard Deviation
│   └── Multiply Momentum by Inverse of Volatility
│       ├── Invert the 10-day Volatility
│       └── Multiply Momentum by this value
├── Calculate High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Compute Daily High-Low Range: Use High price of day t and Low price of day t
│   └── Compute 20-Day Moving Standard Deviation of High-Low Ranges
│       └── Use 20-day window for standard deviation
├── Calculate Open-Close Range Volatility
│   ├── Compute Daily Open-Close Range: Use Open price of day t and Close price of day t
│   └── Compute 20-Day Moving Standard Deviation of Open-Close Ranges
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   └── Subtract Low from High to get daily range
├── Integrate Intraday and Multi-Day Momentum
│   ├── Calculate Intraday Momentum
│   │   ├── Compute High-Low Ratio: (High - Low) / Low
│   │   └── Multiply by Intraday Trading Activity: Volume / (High + Low)
│   ├── Measure Sustained 5-Day Momentum
│   │   ├── Use Close price and Previous Day's Close Prices (for 5 days)
│   │   └── Compute Average Sequential Momentum: Sum((Close - Previous Close) / Previous Close) / 5
│   ├── Combine Intraday and 5-Day Momentum
│   │   ├── Intraday Momentum * 5-Day Average Amount
│   │   ├── Sustained 5-Day Momentum * Volume
│   │   └── Sum the Adjusted Factors
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   └── Subtract Open from Close to get daily change
├── Compute 5-Day Exponential Moving Average of Price Change
│   └── Use the last 5 days' price changes
├── Compute 10-Day Exponential Moving Average of Price Change
│   └── Use the last 10 days' price changes
├── Determine Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 10-Day EMAs
│   │   ├── If 5-Day EMA crosses below 10-Day EMA, signal a bearish trend
│   │   └── If 5-Day EMA crosses above 10-Day EMA, signal a bullish trend
│   └── Consider High-to-Low Range
│       ├── If 14-day Rolling Median of High-to-Low Range is high, amplify the reversal signal
│       └── If 14-day Rolling Median of High-to-Low Range is low, dampen the reversal signal
├── Filter by Volume
│   └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
