Thought: Exploring Momentum and Reversion Factors Using Price Data
    Thought: Calculate 10-day simple moving average (SMA) of the close price to identify short-term trends
        Thought: Define a momentum factor as the difference between the current close price and the 10-day SMA
            Thought: Use the sign of the momentum factor to predict continuation or reversal, assuming positive values indicate continuation and negative values suggest reversion
    Thought: Utilize volume data to identify significant trading activity days
        Thought: Define high-activity days as those where the volume is above its 30-day simple moving average
            Thought: On high-activity days, calculate the percentage change in the closing price from the previous day
                Thought: If this percentage change is positive, increase the momentum score; if negative, decrease it, adjusting the expected future return direction
    Thought: Incorporate the open, high, low, and close prices to measure intraday market sentiment
        Thought: Calculate the daily price range (high - low)
            Thought: Compare the daily close with the midpoint of the daily range (average of high and low)
                Thought: If the close is above the midpoint, interpret it as bullishness for the next period; if below, bearishness. This forms a directional bias indicator.
                    Thought: Combine the directional bias indicator with the volume-based momentum adjustment to create a composite sentiment-adjusted momentum signal
                        Thought: For each day, output the final composite sentiment-adjusted momentum score to predict the stock's potential direction
