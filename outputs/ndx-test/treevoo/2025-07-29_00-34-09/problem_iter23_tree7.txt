Crossover Idea: Generating a Novel Alpha Factor by Combining Momentum and Reversal Signals

- Combine price momentum with reversal signals
  - Calculate the short-term momentum (e.g., 5-day return)
    - Use close prices for calculation
      - Formula: (close_t / close_t-5) - 1
  - Calculate the long-term reversal (e.g., 20-day return)
    - Use close prices for calculation
      - Formula: (close_t / close_t-20) - 1
  - Generate a combined factor
    - Add the short-term momentum and the long-term reversal
      - Formula: short_term_momentum + long_term_reversal
  - Consider the impact of volume
    - If the 5-day average volume is above the 20-day average volume
      - Multiply the combined factor by a factor (e.g., 1.5) to amplify the signal
        - Formula: combined_factor * 1.5
  - Consider the impact of daily price range
    - If the average daily range over 5 days is higher than the 20-day average daily range
      - Multiply the combined factor by a factor (e.g., 1.2) to amplify the signal
        - Formula: combined_factor * 1.2
  - Final Alpha Factor
    - Apply the amplified signal as the final alpha factor
