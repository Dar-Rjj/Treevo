Synthesized Intraday and Multi-Day Momentum with Enhanced Trend Reversal, Volume Interaction, and Volatility Adjustment
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   └── (High - Low) / Low
├── Integrate Intraday and Multi-Day Momentum
│   ├── Intraday Momentum: (High - Low) / Low * Volume / (High + Low)
│   ├── 5-Day Average Sequential Momentum: Sum((Close - Previous Close) / Previous Close) / 5
│   └── Combined Momentum: (Intraday Momentum * 5-Day Average Amount) + (5-Day Momentum * Volume)
├── Daily Price Change
│   └── (Close - Open)
├── Compute 5-Day and 10-Day EMAs of Price Change
│   └── Use the last 5 days' and 10 days' price changes to calculate EMAs
├── Determine Enhanced Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 10-Day EMAs
│   │   ├── If 5-Day EMA crosses below 10-Day EMA, signal a bearish trend
│   │   └── If 5-Day EMA crosses above 10-Day EMA, signal a bullish trend
│   └── Consider 14-day Rolling Standard Deviation of High-to-Low Range
│       ├── If high, amplify the reversal signal
│       └── If low, dampen the reversal signal
├── Filter by Volume
    └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
├── Cumulative Weighted Momentum
│   └── Sum(Weighted Daily Return Over Last 5 Days * Volume) / 5-Day Average Volume
├── Incorporate Volatility into Alpha Factor
│   ├── 21-Day Historical Volatility: Standard Deviation of last 21 days' Close prices
│   └── Final Alpha Factor * (1 / 21-Day Historical Volatility)
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Combined Momentum
    ├── Cumulative Weighted Momentum
    ├── Enhanced Reversal Signal
    └── Volatility-Adjusted Factor
