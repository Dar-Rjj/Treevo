Thought: Crossover of Advanced Momentum, Reversal, and Price-Volume Dynamics with Enhanced Volume-Adjusted and Trend Factors
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Price Movement
│   ├── Compute Daily Log Returns
│   │   ├── Close price of day t
│   │   └── Close price of previous day (t-1)
│   ├── 20-Day EMA of Log Returns
│   │   └── Weigh by Volume
│   │       └── Volume of day t
│   └── Weight by High-Low Range Volatility
│       ├── Daily High-Low Range
│       │   ├── High price of day t
│       │   └── Low price of day t
│       └── 20-Day Moving SD of High-Low Ranges
├── Calculate 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the Close Price
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use the last 10 days' close prices
├── Define a Momentum Factor
│   ├── Difference between the current close price and the 10-day SMA
│   └── Use the sign of the momentum factor to predict continuation or reversal
├── Identify High-Activity Days
│   ├── Define high-activity days as those where the volume is above its 30-day simple moving average
│   └── Use Volume of day t
│       ├── If volume is above the 30-day SMA, mark as high-activity day
│       └── Otherwise, mark as low-activity day
├── Calculate Percentage Change in Close Price on High-Activity Days
│   ├── Only consider high-activity days
│   ├── Percentage change from the previous day
│   └── Adjust the momentum score based on the percentage change
├── Analyze Intraday Market Sentiment
│   ├── Calculate the daily price range (high - low)
│   ├── Compare the daily close with the midpoint of the daily range (average of high and low)
│   └── Determine directional bias
│       ├── If the close is above the midpoint, interpret it as bullishness
│       └── If the close is below the midpoint, interpret it as bearishness
├── Combine Momentum and Sentiment for Composite Signal
│   ├── Use the momentum factor
│   ├── Adjust by the directional bias
│   └── Output the final composite sentiment-adjusted momentum score
├── Filter by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
│       ├── This ensures that the signal is significant
├── Analyze Price Reversals Using High, Low, and Open Prices
│   ├── Use High price
│   ├── Use Low price
│   ├── Use Open price
│   └── Calculate (High - Low) / Open for each day, then sum over 20 days
├── Assess Volume Impact on Price Movement
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate the 20-day Exponential Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close
├── Enhance Trend Analysis with Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA)
│   ├── Calculate the 5-day EWMA of close prices
│   └── Calculate the 20-day EWMA of close prices
├── Incorporate Dynamic Volume-Weighted Price Actions
│   ├── Calculate the cumulative volume over a rolling period
│   │   ├── Compute the 5-day rolling total volume
│   │   └── Compute the 20-day rolling total volume
│   └── Calculate the time-series volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
│       ├── Compute the 5-day VWAP using a rolling window
│       └── Compute the 20-day VWAP using a rolling window
├── Investigate Recent Price Volatility with High and Low Prices
│   ├── Calculate the true range as a measure of daily price movement
│   │   ├── Compute the 5-day average true range (ATR) using high, low, and close prices
│   │   └── Compute the 20-day average true range (ATR) using high, low, and close prices
├── Analyze Trading Volume Patterns with High and Low Volumes
│   ├── Identify changes in trading volume
│   │   ├── Compute the 5-day rate of change (ROC) in volume
│   │   └── Compute the 20-day rate of change (ROC) in volume
│   └── Identify high volume days
│       ├── Determine if the current day's volume is higher than the 5-day average volume
│       └── Determine if the current day's volume is higher than the
