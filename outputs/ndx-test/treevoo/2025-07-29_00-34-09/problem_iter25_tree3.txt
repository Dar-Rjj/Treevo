Crossover Enhanced Momentum and Price Range Volatility
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   ├── Subtract Open from Close to get daily change
├── Compute 5-Day EMA of Price Change
│   ├── Use the last 5 days' price changes
│   └── Calculate the EMA
├── Compute 10-Day EMA of Price Change
│   ├── Use the last 10 days' price changes
│   └── Calculate the EMA
├── Determine Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 10-Day EMAs
│   │   ├── If 5-Day EMA crosses below 10-Day EMA, signal a bearish trend
│   │   └── If 5-Day EMA crosses above 10-Day EMA, signal a bullish trend
├── Filter by Volume
│   ├── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Price (VAP)
│   ├── Use High, Low, and Close prices to calculate Typical Price
│   └── Weight Typical Price by Volume
├── Calculate Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 20-day EMA of VAP
│   │   ├── Use VAP for EMA calculation
│   └── Subtract 20-day EMA from current VAP
├── Incorporate Recent Volatility
│   ├── Compute 10-day Standard Deviation of daily returns
│   └── Multiply Momentum by Inverse of Volatility
├── Calculate High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Compute 20-Day Moving Standard Deviation of High-Low Ranges
├── Combine Crossover Momentum and Composite Volatility
    ├── Use Raw Value of Volume Adjusted Momentum
    └── Subtract Average of High-Low Range Volatilities
├── Enhance with Additional Volatility Measure
    ├── Compute 30-Day Moving Standard Deviation of High-Low Ranges
    └── Combine with Existing Volatility Measures
        ├── Average of 20-Day and 30-Day High-Low Range Volatilities
├── Calculate 5-Day Price Range
    ├── Calculate the difference between the highest high and lowest low
├── Incorporate 5-Day Price Range into Momentum
    ├── Normalize 5-Day Price Range
    │   ├── Divide by the average of the 5-day High and Low prices
    └── Multiply the normalized 5-Day Price Range by the Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── Calculate 10-Day Price Range
    ├── Calculate the difference between the highest high and lowest low
├── Incorporate 10-Day Price Range into Momentum
    ├── Normalize 10-Day Price Range
    │   ├── Divide by the average of the 10-day High and Low prices
    └── Multiply the normalized 10-Day Price Range by the Volume Adjusted Momentum
├── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Sum of Volume Adjusted Momentum, 5-Day Price Range Adjusted Momentum, and 10-Day Price Range Adjusted Momentum
    └── Subtract the combined volatility measures
        ├── Average of 20-Day and 30-Day High-Low Range Volatilities
