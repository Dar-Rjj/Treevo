[Novel Alpha Factor Generation]
- [Momentum Indicators]
  - [Price Momentum]
    - Calculate the percentage change in closing price over different time horizons (e.g., 5, 20, and 60 days) to capture short, medium, and long-term momentum.
  - [Volume Momentum]
    - Calculate the ratio of current volume to the average volume over a certain period (e.g., 20 days) to identify if the stock is trading with higher-than-normal volume, which could indicate strong interest or a trend continuation.
- [Volatility Indicators]
  - [Historical Volatility]
    - Compute the standard deviation of daily returns over various periods (e.g., 10, 30, 60, and 120 days) to understand the historical volatility of the stock.
  - [Intraday Volatility]
    - Calculate the difference between the high and low prices, then divide it by the opening price to determine the intraday volatility. This can be done for a single day or averaged over a period (e.g., 5, 20 days).
- [Trend Strength Indicators]
  - [Average Directional Index (ADX)]
    - Use the ADX without normalization, calculated over a specific period (e.g., 14 days), to measure the strength of the trend. The higher the ADX value, the stronger the trend, regardless of direction.
  - [Relative Strength Index (RSI)]
    - Calculate RSI over various periods (e.g., 14, 28 days) to assess whether the stock is overbought or oversold. The calculation should use the closing price and avoid any form of data normalization.
- [Sentiment Indicators]
  - [Open-Close Ratio]
    - Divide the closing price by the opening price to gauge the sentiment of the market participants. A ratio above 1 indicates a bullish sentiment, while below 1 suggests bearishness.
  - [High-Low Range to Close Price]
    - Calculate the range (high-low) as a percentage of the closing price to measure how volatile the day was relative to the end-of-day price. This can give insights into the market's hesitation or confidence.
- [Liquidity Indicators]
  - [Amount Turnover Rate]
    - Compute the daily traded amount as a percentage of the total market capitalization to evaluate the liquidity of the stock. Higher turnover rates may suggest better liquidity and potentially lower risk.
  - [Volume to Average Volume Ratio]
    - Similar to the volume momentum, but instead focusing on how the current day’s volume compares to the long-term average (e.g., 100 days). This can help identify unusual trading activity.
- [Pattern Recognition]
  - [Candlestick Patterns]
    - Identify key candlestick patterns (e.g., Doji, Hammer, Shooting Star, Bullish/Bearish Engulfing) using open, high, low, close prices to predict possible reversals or continuations of trends based on pattern recognition.
  - [Trend Line Breaks]
    - Detect when the closing price crosses above or below a trend line (up or down) formed by connecting previous highs or lows. This can signal potential trend changes.
- [Composite Factors]
  - [Integrated Momentum-Volatility Score]
    - Combine the price momentum (short, medium, and long-term), volume momentum, and historical volatility into a single score. This composite factor aims to encapsulate both the direction and stability of the stock movement.
  - [Sentiment-Adjusted Trend Strength]
    - Adjust the ADX or RSI values by multiplying them with the Open-Close Ratio or High-Low Range to Close Price. This adjustment aims to incorporate market sentiment into the traditional trend strength indicators, potentially providing a more nuanced view of the trend's robustness.
