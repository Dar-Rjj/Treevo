Synthesized Intraday, Multi-Day Momentum, and Enhanced Volatility Alpha Factors
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   └── (High - Low) / Low
├── Integrate Intraday and Multi-Day Momentum with Volume Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── (High - Low) / Low * Volume / (High + Low)
│   ├── 5-Day Average Sequential Momentum: Sum((Close - Previous Close) / Previous Close) / 5
│   ├── Compute Daily Log Returns
│   │   ├── Close price of day t
│   │   └── Close price of previous day (t-1)
│   ├── 20-Day EMA of Log Returns
│   ├── Weight by Volume
│   │   └── Volume of day t
│   └── (Intraday Momentum * 5-Day Average Amount) + (Sustained 5-Day Momentum * Volume) + (20-Day EMA of Log Returns * Volume of day t)
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   └── (Close - Open)
├── Compute 5-Day and 10-Day EMAs of Price Change
│   └── Use the last 5 days' and 10 days' price changes to calculate EMAs
├── Determine Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 10-Day EMAs
│   │   ├── If 5-Day EMA crosses below 10-Day EMA, signal a bearish trend
│   │   └── If 5-Day EMA crosses above 10-Day EMA, signal a bullish trend
│   └── Consider 14-day Rolling Median of High-to-Low Range
│       ├── If high, amplify the reversal signal
│       └── If low, dampen the reversal signal
├── Filter by Volume
    └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
├── Incorporate Enhanced Volatility into Alpha Factor
│   ├── 21-Day Historical Volatility: Standard Deviation of last 21 days' Close prices
│   ├── 20-Day Moving SD of High-Low Ranges
│   │   ├── Daily High-Low Range
│   │   │   ├── High price of day t
│   │   │   └── Low price of day t
│   │   └── 20-Day Moving SD of High-Low Ranges
│   └── 20-Day Moving SD of Open to Previous Close Differences
│       ├── Daily Open to Previous Close Difference
│       │   ├── Open price of day t
│       │   └── Close price of previous day (t-1)
│       └── 20-Day Moving SD of Open to Previous Close Differences
├── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Intraday and 5-Day Combined Momentum
    ├── 20-Day EMA of Log Returns * Volume of day t
    ├── Reversal Signal
    └── Volatility-Adjusted Factor: (1 / (21-Day Historical Volatility * 20-Day Moving SD of High-Low Ranges * 20-Day Moving SD of Open to Previous Close Differences))
