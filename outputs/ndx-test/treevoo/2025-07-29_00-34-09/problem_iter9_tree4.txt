Synthesized Momentum and Trend Reversal Indicator with Volume-Weighted Price Change
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       ├── Subtract Low from High to get daily range
├── Calculate Rolling Average of High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use a 20-day window
│   └── Calculate the average of the last 20 days
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t
│       ├── Subtract Open from Close to get daily change
├── Compute 5-Day Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Price Change
│   ├── Use the last 5 days' price changes and volumes
│   │   ├── Multiply each day's price change by its volume
│   │   └── Sum the volume-weighted price changes
│   └── Divide the sum by the total volume over the 5 days
├── Compute 15-Day Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Price Change
│   ├── Use the last 15 days' price changes and volumes
│   │   ├── Multiply each day's price change by its volume
│   │   └── Sum the volume-weighted price changes
│   └── Divide the sum by the total volume over the 15 days
├── Determine Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 15-Day Moving Averages
│   │   ├── If 5-Day MA crosses below 15-Day MA, signal a bearish trend
│   │   └── If 5-Day MA crosses above 15-Day MA, signal a bullish trend
│   └── Consider High-to-Low Range
│       ├── If 20-day Rolling Average of High-to-Low Range is high,
│       │   amplify the reversal signal
│       └── If 20-day Rolling Average of High-to-Low Range is low,
│           dampen the reversal signal
└── Filter by Volume
    ├── Use Volume of day t
    └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
        ├── This ensures that the signal is significant
