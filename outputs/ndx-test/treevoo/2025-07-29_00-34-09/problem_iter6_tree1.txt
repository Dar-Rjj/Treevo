Synthesized Momentum and Trend Reversal Indicator
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Use Low price of day t
│       ├── Subtract Low from High to get daily range
├── Calculate Rolling Median of High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use a 14-day window
│   └── Calculate the median of the last 14 days
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Open price of day t
│       ├── Subtract Open from Close to get daily change
├── Compute 5-Day Exponential Moving Average of Price Change
│   ├── Use the last 5 days' price changes
│   └── Calculate the EMA
├── Compute 10-Day Exponential Moving Average of Price Change
│   ├── Use the last 10 days' price changes
│   └── Calculate the EMA
├── Determine Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 10-Day EMAs
│   │   ├── If 5-Day EMA crosses below 10-Day EMA, signal a bearish trend
│   │   └── If 5-Day EMA crosses above 10-Day EMA, signal a bullish trend
│   └── Consider High-to-Low Range
│       ├── If 14-day Rolling Median of High-to-Low Range is high, 
│       │   amplify the reversal signal
│       └── If 14-day Rolling Median of High-to-Low Range is low,
│           dampen the reversal signal
└── Filter by Volume
    ├── Use Volume of day t
    └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
        ├── This ensures that the signal is significant
