Volume-Adjusted Momentum, High-Low Range Volatility, and Trend Reversal with Volume Filter
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Price (VAP)
│   ├── Compute Typical Price: (High + Low + Close) / 3
│   └── Weight Typical Price by Volume
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Compute 20-day EMA of VAP
│   └── Subtract 20-day EMA from current VAP
├── Incorporate Recent Volatility
│   ├── Compute 10-day Standard Deviation of daily returns
│   │   ├── Daily Returns: (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
│   └── Multiply Momentum by Inverse of Volatility
├── Calculate High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Compute Daily High-Low Range: High - Low
│   └── Compute 20-Day Moving Standard Deviation of High-Low Ranges
├── Calculate Open-Close Range Volatility
│   ├── Compute Daily Open-Close Range: Open - Close
│   └── Compute 20-Day Moving Standard Deviation of Open-Close Ranges
├── Combine Volume-Adjusted Momentum and Composite Volatility
│   ├── Use Raw Value of Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   └── Subtract Average of High-Low and Open-Close Range Volatilities
├── Calculate High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High to get daily range
├── Calculate Rolling Average of High-to-Low Range
│   ├── Use a 20-day window
│   └── Calculate the average of the last 20 days
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   ├── Subtract Open from Close to get daily change
├── Compute 5-Day Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Price Change
│   ├── Use the last 5 days' price changes and volumes
│   │   ├── Multiply each day's price change by its volume
│   │   └── Sum the volume-weighted price changes
│   └── Divide the sum by the total volume over the 5 days
├── Compute 15-Day Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Price Change
│   ├── Use the last 15 days' price changes and volumes
│   │   ├── Multiply each day's price change by its volume
│   │   └── Sum the volume-weighted price changes
│   └── Divide the sum by the total volume over the 15 days
├── Determine Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 15-Day Moving Averages
│   │   ├── If 5-Day MA crosses below 15-Day MA, signal a bearish trend
│   │   └── If 5-Day MA crosses above 15-Day MA, signal a bullish trend
│   └── Consider High-to-Low Range
│       ├── If 20-day Rolling Average of High-to-Low Range is high,
│       │   amplify the reversal signal
│       └── If 20-day Rolling Average of High-to-Low Range is low,
│           dampen the reversal signal
└── Filter by Volume
    ├── Use Volume of day t
    └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
        ├── This ensures that the signal is significant
