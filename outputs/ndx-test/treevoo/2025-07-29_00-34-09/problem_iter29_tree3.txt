Crossover Integrated Alpha Factor Synthesis with Enhanced Momentum, Volatility, and Price-Volume Dynamics
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Momentum with Enhanced VWAP and High-Low Range
│   ├── Compute Daily Log Returns for VWAP
│   │   ├── VWAP of day t
│   │   └── VWAP of previous day (t-1)
│   ├── 20-Day EMA of VWAP Log Returns
│   │   └── Weigh by Volume
│   │       └── Volume of day t
│   └── Weight by High-Low Range Volatility
│       ├── Daily High-Low Range
│       │   ├── High price of day t
│       │   └── Low price of day t
│       └── 20-Day Moving SD of High-Low Ranges
├── Calculate 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the Close Price
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use the last 10 days' close prices
├── Define a Momentum Factor
│   ├── Difference between the current close price and the 10-day SMA
│   └── Use the sign of the momentum factor to predict continuation or reversal
├── Identify High-Activity Days
│   ├── Define high-activity days as those where the volume is above its 30-day simple moving average
│   └── Use Volume of day t
│       ├── If volume is above the 30-day SMA, mark as high-activity day
│       └── Otherwise, mark as low-activity day
├── Calculate Percentage Change in Close Price on High-Activity Days
│   ├── Only consider high-activity days
│   ├── Percentage change from the previous day
│   └── Adjust the momentum score based on the percentage change
├── Analyze Intraday Market Sentiment
│   ├── Calculate the daily price range (high - low)
│   ├── Compare the daily close with the midpoint of the daily range (average of high and low)
│   └── Determine directional bias
│       ├── If the close is above the midpoint, interpret it as bullishness
│       └── If the close is below the midpoint, interpret it as bearishness
├── Combine Momentum and Sentiment for Composite Signal
│   ├── Use the momentum factor
│   ├── Adjust by the directional bias
│   └── Output the final composite sentiment-adjusted momentum score
├── Filter by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
│       ├── This ensures that the signal is significant
├── Synthesize High-Low Range and Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Daily High-Low Range
│   │   ├── High price of day t
│   │   └── Low price of day t
│   └── Intraday Volatility Metric
│       └── (High Price - Low Price) / Volume
├── Integrate High-to-Low Range Momentum Adjusted by Composite Volatility
│   └── Adjust by Inverse of 14-Day High-to-Low Range Sum and Intraday Volatility
│       ├── Rolling 14-Day High-to-Low Range Sum
│       │   └── Sum of the Last 14 Days' (High Price - Low Price)
│       └── Difference between Consecutive VWAP
├── Incorporate Recent Price Momentum
│   ├── 14-Day Momentum
│   │   └── (Close Price - Close Price 14 days ago) / Close Price 14 days ago
│   └── 60-Day Momentum
│       └── (Close Price - Close Price 60 days ago) / Close Price 60 days ago
├── Combine Volume-Adjusted Momentum and Composite Volatility Adjustments
│   ├── Subtract Average of 20-Day Moving Averages of Ranges
│   │   ├── 20-Day Moving Average of Daily High-Low Ranges
│   │   │   └── High price - Low price
│   │   └── 20-Day Moving Average of Daily Open-Close Ranges
│   │       └── Open price - Close price
│   └── Multiply by Inverse of 10-day Standard Deviation of VWAP Log Returns
