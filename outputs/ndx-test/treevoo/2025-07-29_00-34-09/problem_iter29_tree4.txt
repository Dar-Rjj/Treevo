Thought: Crossover Enhanced Volume-Adjusted Momentum, Volatility, and Price-Volume Dynamics with High-Low Range and Trend Analysis
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Price (VWP)
│   └── (High Price * Volume + Low Price * Volume) / (2 * Volume)
├── Assess Intraday Volatility
│   └── High Price - Low Price
├── Integrate High-to-Low Range Momentum
│   ├── Rolling 20-Day High-to-Low Range Sum
│   │   └── Sum of the Last 20 Days' (High Price - Low Price)
│   ├── Difference between Consecutive VWP
│   └── Adjust by 20-Day High-to-Low Range Sum
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── 25-day EMA of VWP
│   └── Subtract 25-day EMA from current VWP
├── Incorporate Recent Volatility
│   ├── 15-day Standard Deviation of daily returns
│   └── Multiply Momentum by Inverse of Volatility
├── Combine Volume-Adjusted Momentum and High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Use Raw Value of Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   └── Subtract 30-Day Moving Average of (High price - Low price)
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Momentum with High-Low Range
│   ├── Compute Daily Log Returns
│   │   ├── Close price of day t
│   │   └── Close price of previous day (t-1)
│   ├── 20-Day EMA of Log Returns
│   │   └── Weigh by Volume
│   │       └── Volume of day t
│   └── Weight by High-Low Range Volatility
│       ├── Daily High-Low Range
│       │   ├── High price of day t
│       │   └── Low price of day t
│       └── 20-Day Moving SD of High-Low Ranges
├── Calculate 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the Close Price
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use the last 10 days' close prices
├── Define a Momentum Factor
│   ├── Difference between the current close price and the 10-day SMA
│   └── Use the sign of the momentum factor to predict continuation or reversal
├── Identify High-Activity Days
│   ├── Define high-activity days as those where the volume is above its 30-day simple moving average
│   └── Use Volume of day t
│       ├── If volume is above the 30-day SMA, mark as high-activity day
│       └── Otherwise, mark as low-activity day
├── Calculate Percentage Change in Close Price on High-Activity Days
│   ├── Only consider high-activity days
│   ├── Percentage change from the previous day
│   └── Adjust the momentum score based on the percentage change
├── Analyze Intraday Market Sentiment
│   ├── Calculate the daily price range (high - low)
│   ├── Compare the daily close with the midpoint of the daily range (average of high and low)
│   └── Determine directional bias
│       ├── If the close is above the midpoint, interpret it as bullishness
│       └── If the close is below the midpoint, interpret it as bearishness
├── Combine Momentum and Sentiment for Composite Signal
│   ├── Use the momentum factor
│   ├── Adjust by the directional bias
│   └── Output the final composite sentiment-adjusted momentum score
├── Filter by Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Only consider signal if volume is above a certain threshold
│       ├── This ensures that the signal is significant
├── Calculate High-Low Range Volatility
│   ├── Daily High-Low Range
│   │   ├── High price of day t
│   │   └── Low price of day t
│   └── 20-Day Moving SD of High-Low Ranges
├── Calculate Opening Gap Volatility
│   ├── Daily Open to Previous Close Difference
│   │   ├── Open price of day t
│   │   └── Close price of previous day (t-1)
│   └── 20-Day Moving SD of Open to Previous Close Differences
├── Assess Volume Impact on Price Movement
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Calculate the 20-day Exponential Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close
└── Combine Factors for Final Alpha
