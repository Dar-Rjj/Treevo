├── Determine Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 10-Day Moving Averages of (Close - Open)
│   │   ├── Bearish if 5-Day MA < 10-Day MA
│   │   └── Bullish if 5-Day MA > 10-Day MA
│   └── Consider 14-day Rolling Average of High-to-Low Range to amplify or dampen signal
├── Analyze Price Reversals Using High, Low, and Open Prices
