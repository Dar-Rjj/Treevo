Crossover of Volume-Adjusted Momentum, Volatility, and Trend Reversal Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Volume-Adjusted Price Movement
│   ├── Daily Log Returns (Close price of day t / Close price of t-1)
│   ├── 20-Day EMA of Log Returns, weighted by Volume of day t
│   └── Weight by High-Low Range Volatility (20-Day Moving SD of High-Low Ranges)
├── Determine Reversal Signal
│   ├── Compare 5-Day and 10-Day Moving Averages of (Close - Open)
│   │   ├── Bearish if 5-Day MA < 10-Day MA
│   │   └── Bullish if 5-Day MA > 10-Day MA
│   └── Amplify or dampen signal with 14-day Rolling Average of High-to-Low Range
└── Analyze Price Reversals Using High, Low, and Open Prices
    └── 20-day sum of (High - Low) / Open
└── Assess Volume Impact on Price Movement
    └── 20-day Exponential Moving Average of Volume-Weighted Close
