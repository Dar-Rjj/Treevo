Thought: Analyze historical price and volume data to identify momentum, volatility, and trading activity patterns
  Sub-thought: Calculate the rate of change in closing prices over different time windows
    Sub-thought: Rate of change over 5 days (ROC_5) = (Close_t / Close_(t-5)) - 1
    Sub-thought: Rate of change over 20 days (ROC_20) = (Close_t / Close_(t-20)) - 1
    Sub-thought: Rate of change over 60 days (ROC_60) = (Close_t / Close_(t-60)) - 1
  Sub-thought: Analyze price movement relative to the highest and lowest prices within a given period
    Sub-thought: Williams %R over 14 days (Williams_R_14) = (High_14 - Close_t) / (High_14 - Low_14) * -100
    Sub-thought: Williams %R over 28 days (Williams_R_28) = (High_28 - Close_t) / (High_28 - Low_28) * -100
  Sub-thought: Measure the volatility based on the standard deviation of price changes
    Sub-thought: Volatility over 30 days (Volatility_30) = Standard Deviation(Close_t, Close_(t-1), ..., Close_(t-30))
    Sub-thought: Volatility over 60 days (Volatility_60) = Standard Deviation(Close_t, Close_(t-1), ..., Close_(t-60))
  Sub-thought: Evaluate trading activity and liquidity by analyzing volume
    Sub-thought: Average Volume over 10 days (Avg_Volume_10) = Mean(Volume_t, Volume_(t-1), ..., Volume_(t-10))
    Sub-thought: Volume Relative Strength (VRS) over 10 days = Avg_Volume_10 / Avg_Volume_20
    Sub-thought: Volume Momentum (VM) over 10 days = (Volume_t - Volume_(t-10)) / Volume_(t-10)
  Sub-thought: Identify breakouts and consolidation patterns
    Sub-thought: Price Breakout Indicator (PBI) = (Close_t - Min(Low_t, ..., Low_(t-19))) / Min(Low_t, ..., Low_(t-19)) * 100 if Close_t > Max(High_t, ..., High_(t-19)) else 0
    Sub-thought: Price Consolidation Indicator (PCI) = (Max(High_t, ..., High_(t-19)) - Min(Low_t, ..., Low_(t-19))) / Close_t
  Sub-thought: Examine the relationship between open and close prices
    Sub-thought: Open-Close Ratio (OCR) = Close_t / Open_t
    Sub-thought: Number of Days with Positive OCR (Positive_OCR_Count) = Count(OCR > 1) over the last 20 days
    Sub-thought: Number of Days with Negative OCR (Negative_OCR_Count) = Count(OCR < 1) over the last 20 days
  Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between high and low prices
    Sub-thought: High-Low Ratio (HLR) = High_t / Low_t
    Sub-thought: Number of Days with High-Low Ratio above 1.05 (HLR_1_05_Count) = Count(HLR > 1.05) over the last 20 days
