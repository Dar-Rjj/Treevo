Thought: Utilize price and volume data to create predictive factors for stock returns
- Sub-Thought: Calculate momentum based on close prices
  - Sub-Thought: Simple moving average (SMA) of close prices over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
  - Sub-Thought: SMA of close prices over a long period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between short and long SMAs as a momentum signal
  - Sub-Thought: Momentum crossover signal
    - Sub-Thought: Generate a buy signal when short SMA crosses above long SMA
    - Sub-Thought: Generate a sell signal when short SMA crosses below long SMA
- Sub-Thought: Analyze trading activity using volume and amount
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate daily volume weighted average price (VWAP)
    - Sub-Thought: Sum of (close price * volume) / total volume
  - Sub-Thought: Track changes in VWAP over time
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in VWAP from the previous day
  - Sub-Thought: Volume spike indicator
    - Sub-Thought: Identify significant increases in volume compared to the average volume
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of current volume to the average volume over a period
- Sub-Thought: Identify volatility using high, low, and close prices
  - Sub-Thought: True range calculation
    - Sub-Thought: Max(High - Low, Abs(High - Previous Close), Abs(Low - Previous Close))
  - Sub-Thought: Average true range (ATR) over a period
    - Sub-Thought: SMA of true ranges over a set period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Volatility breakout
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the upper and lower volatility bands
      - Sub-Thought: Upper band = EMA of close prices + ATR * multiplier
      - Sub-Thought: Lower band = EMA of close prices - ATR * multiplier
    - Sub-Thought: Generate signals when the price crosses the volatility bands
      - Sub-Thought: Buy signal when the price crosses above the upper band
      - Sub-Thought: Sell signal when the price crosses below the lower band
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate market sentiment using open and close prices
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily return
    - Sub-Thought: (Close - Open) / Open
  - Sub-Thought: Cumulative return over a recent period
    - Sub-Thought: Product of (1 + daily return) over the last n days - 1
  - Sub-Thought: Sentiment trend
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the rolling sum of positive and negative daily returns over a period
    - Sub-Thought: Generate a bullish or bearish sentiment signal based on the rolling sum
- Sub-Thought: Detect trends with moving averages
  - Sub-Thought: Exponential moving average (EMA) of close prices
    - Sub-Thought: EMA with a span of 5 days
    - Sub-Thought: EMA with a span of 20 days
  - Sub-Thought: Trend direction based on the slope of EMAs
    - Sub-Thought: Difference between current and previous EMA values
  - Sub-Thought: EMA crossover
    - Sub-Thought: Generate a buy signal when 5-day EMA crosses above 20-day EMA
    - Sub-Thought: Generate a sell signal when 5-day EMA crosses below 20-day EMA
  - Sub-Thought: Trend strength
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the distance between the 5-day and 20-day EMAs
    - Sub-Thought: Use the distance as an indicator of trend strength
- Sub-Thought: Combine momentum, volume, volatility, and sentiment factors
  - Sub-Thought: Composite score calculation
    - Sub-Thought: Assign weights to each factor (momentum, volume, volatility, sentiment)
    - Sub-Thought: Sum the weighted factors to generate a composite score
  - Sub-Thought: Composite signal generation
    - Sub-Thought: Generate a buy signal when the composite score exceeds a threshold
    - Sub-Thought: Generate a sell signal when the composite score falls below a threshold
