Thought: Calculate the difference between the closing price and the opening price as a simple indicator of daily performance.
- Sub-thought: Determine if the daily performance is increasing or decreasing over a short period (e.g., 5 days).
    - Sub-thought: Count the number of days the daily performance was positive in the last 5 days.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the average daily performance over the past 20 trading days to identify medium-term trend.
    - Sub-thought: Evaluate if the current day's performance is above or below this 20-day average.
- Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of the closing price to the highest price of the day for an indication of the stock's strength on that day.
    - Sub-thought: Measure the consistency of this ratio over the past 10 days to understand the stock's resilience.
- Sub-thought: Use the volume data to assess how much activity there was during the day.
    - Sub-thought: Compare today's volume with the average volume over the past 30 days to detect any unusual activities.
- Sub-thought: Investigate the relationship between the daily amount traded and the closing price.
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the correlation between the daily amount and the closing price over the last 60 days.
- Sub-thought: Analyze the pattern of the low prices over a specific period (e.g., 10 days) to see if there are any supports being tested or broken.
    - Sub-thought: Mark the days when the low price was lower than the lowest price of the past 9 days, indicating potential breakouts.
