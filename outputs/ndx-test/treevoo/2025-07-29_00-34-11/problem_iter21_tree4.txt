Thought: Explore price action patterns
- Sub-thought: Calculate the relative closing price change
  - Formula: (close[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1]
- Sub-thought: Analyze high and low price behavior
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the true range
    - Formula: max(high[t], close[t-1]) - min(low[t], close[t-1])
  - Sub-sub-thought: Measure the upper shadow length
    - Formula: high[t] - max(open[t], close[t])
  - Sub-sub-thought: Measure the lower shadow length
    - Formula: min(open[t], close[t]) - low[t]

Thought: Investigate volume-related factors
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the ratio of current to previous day's volume
  - Formula: volume[t] / volume[t-1]
- Sub-thought: Assess the volume-weighted close price
  - Formula: (close[t] * volume[t])

Thought: Derive momentum indicators from price data
- Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
  - Formula: sum(close[t-i] for i in range(0, n)) / n
- Sub-thought: Determine the rate of change (ROC) over a period
  - Formula: (close[t] - close[t-n]) / close[t-n]
- Sub-thought: Identify the directional movement using the difference between consecutive closes
  - Formula: close[t] - close[t-1]

Thought: Integrate amount into analysis
- Sub-thought: Consider the ratio of daily amount to volume
  - Formula: amount[t] / volume[t]
- Sub-thought: Examine the relationship between amount and price
  - Formula: (amount[t] / volume[t]) * close[t]
