[Novel Alpha Factor Generation]
- [Price Momentum Factors]
  - [Simple Moving Average Crossover]
    - Calculate the 5-day and 20-day simple moving averages of closing prices.
    - Generate a factor: (5-day SMA - 20-day SMA) / 20-day SMA
  - [Rate of Change (ROC)]
    - Calculate the rate of change of closing prices over 10 days.
    - Generate a factor: (Close_t - Close_{t-10}) / Close_{t-10}
- [Volume-based Factors]
  - [On-Balance Volume (OBV)]
    - Track the cumulative volume based on whether the closing price is higher or lower than the previous day.
    - Generate a factor: Cumulative OBV
  - [Volume Momentum]
    - Calculate the 5-day average volume.
    - Generate a factor: (Current Volume - 5-day Avg Volume) / 5-day Avg Volume
- [Volatility Factors]
  - [True Range]
    - Calculate the true range for each day.
    - Generate a factor: 14-day average of true range
  - [Average True Range (ATR)]
    - Calculate the 14-day average true range.
    - Generate a factor: ATR
- [Price-Volume Correlation]
  - [Price-Volume Trend (PVT)]
    - Calculate the price-volume trend by incorporating the percentage change in closing price with the daily volume.
    - Generate a factor: PVT
- [Gap Analysis]
  - [Gap Up/Down]
    - Identify gaps where the open price is significantly higher or lower than the previous day's close.
    - Generate a factor: (Open_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
- [Intraday Price Movements]
  - [High-Low Range]
    - Calculate the difference between the high and low prices for the day.
    - Generate a factor: (High_t - Low_t) / Low_t
  - [High-Close Ratio]
    - Calculate the ratio of the high price to the closing price.
    - Generate a factor: High_t / Close_t
