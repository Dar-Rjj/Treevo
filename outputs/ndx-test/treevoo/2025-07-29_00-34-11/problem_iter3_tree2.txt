Price Momentum and Volume Confirmation with Enhanced Signal
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Obtain Last 5 Days' Close Prices
│   │   └── Use Close price
│   ├── Calculate Moving Averages
│   │   ├── Short-term (e.g., 3-day) Moving Average
│   │   │   └── Use Last 3 Days' Close Prices
│   │   └── Long-term (e.g., 10-day) Moving Average
│   │       └── Use Last 10 Days' Close Prices
│   └── Compute Momentum Signal
│       ├── Subtract Short-term MA from Long-term MA
│       └── Determine Momentum Direction
│           ├── Positive if Difference is Increasing
│           └── Negative if Difference is Decreasing
└── Confirm Momentum with Volume
    ├── Calculate Volume Ratio
    │   ├── Sum of Volume for the Last 5 Days
    │   └── Divide by Average Daily Volume of the Last 20 Days
    └── Apply Volume Filter
        ├── Check if Volume Ratio is Above a Threshold
        └── Output Alpha Factor
            ├── If Momentum and Volume Align, Assign Positive Factor
            │   ├── If Momentum is Positive and Volume is High, Assign Strong Positive Factor
            │   └── If Momentum is Negative and Volume is Low, Assign Weak Negative Factor
            └── Otherwise, Assign Neutral or Negative Factor
                ├── If Momentum is Positive but Volume is Low, Assign Neutral Factor
                └── If Momentum is Negative but Volume is High, Assign Negative Factor
