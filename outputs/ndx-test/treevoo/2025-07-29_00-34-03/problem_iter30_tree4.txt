Thought: Develop advanced alpha factors using price and volume data
- Thought: Calculate momentum-based factors
  - Thought: Determine the simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over N days
  - Thought: Evaluate the difference between the current closing price and the SMA as a factor
  - Thought: Analyze the rate of change (ROC) of closing prices over M days
  - Thought: Compute the exponential moving average (EMA) of closing prices over O days
  - Thought: Calculate the difference between the current closing price and the EMA as a factor
  - Thought: Create a momentum factor by combining the ROC and the difference between the current closing price and the SMA
- Thought: Create volatility-based factors
  - Thought: Calculate the true range (highest high minus lowest low, or highest high/lowest close, or yesterday's close/lowest low) over K days
  - Thought: Sum the true ranges to find the Average True Range (ATR) over L days
  - Thought: Utilize the ATR as an indicator of volatility
  - Thought: Compute the standard deviation of closing prices over S days
  - Thought: Use the standard deviation as a measure of volatility
  - Thought: Combine the ATR and standard deviation to create a composite volatility factor
- Thought: Generate volume-based factors
  - Thought: Compute the moving average of trading volume over P days
  - Thought: Assess the ratio of the current day's volume to the moving average volume as a potential factor
  - Thought: Investigate the cumulative sum of volumes on up days and down days separately, over Q days
  - Thought: Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) over T days
  - Thought: Use the difference between the current close and VWAP as a factor
  - Thought: Create a factor based on the difference in cumulative volume between up and down days
- Thought: Explore pattern recognition for alpha generation
  - Thought: Identify candlestick patterns (e.g., doji, hammer, engulfing) using open, high, low, and close prices
  - Thought: Score the presence of specific patterns as positive or negative factors based on their predictive power
  - Thought: Count the number of bullish and bearish reversal signals in the last R days
  - Thought: Identify gaps in the opening price compared to the previous day's close
  - Thought: Score the presence of gaps as positive or negative factors
  - Thought: Create a composite score combining the presence of candlestick patterns, reversal signals, and gaps
- Thought: Introduce inter-day price and volume relationships
  - Thought: Calculate the ratio of the current day's closing price to the previous day's closing price
  - Thought: Analyze the relationship between the current day's volume and the previous day's volume
  - Thought: Create a factor based on the combination of price and volume changes from one day to the next
- Thought: Incorporate high and low price information
  - Thought: Calculate the range (high - low) for each day
  - Thought: Analyze the ratio of the current day's range to the previous day's range
  - Thought: Create a factor based on the change in daily range
  - Thought: Calculate the distance between the current day's close and the day's high and low
  - Thought: Use the distances as a factor to gauge the position of the closing price within the day's range
