Volume-Weighted and Momentum Integrated Alpha Factor with Enhanced Volatility and Volume Adjustments
├── Compute Weighted Close Price
│   ├── Multiply Volume by Close Price
├── Calculate Adjusted SMA of Weighted Close Prices
│   ├── Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Weighted Close Prices
│   └── Smooth Realized Volatility
│       ├── Use High and Low Prices for Realized Volatility
│       │   └── Standard Deviation of Log Returns over the last 10 days
│       └── Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Realized Volatility over the last 20 days
│   └── Subtract Smoothed Volatility from SMA
├── Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close prices over the last 5 days
│   └── Compute the average
├── Calculate Medium-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close prices over the last 10 days
│   └── Compute the average
├── Calculate Long-Term Price Momentum
    ├── Use Close prices over the last 20 days
    └── Compute the average
├── Determine the Difference between Short, Medium, and Long-Term Momentum
│   ├── Compute the difference between Short and Medium-Term Momentum
│   └── Compute the difference between Medium and Long-Term Momentum
├── Incorporate Volume Trend
    ├── Calculate Average Volume over the last 5 days
    ├── Calculate Average Volume over the last 20 days
    └── Compute the difference between short and long-term volume averages
├── Combine Momentum and Volume-Weighted Return
    ├── Add the Differences in Price Momentum to the Adjusted SMA
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Use the Result from the Combined Momentum and Adjusted SMA
