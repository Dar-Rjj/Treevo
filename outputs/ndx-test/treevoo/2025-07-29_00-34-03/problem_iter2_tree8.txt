Volume-Weighted Price Momentum with Volatility Adjustment and Volume Surge
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Prices
│   ├── Compute Weighted Close Price
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Multiply Volume by Close Price
│   └── Compute Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Weighted Close Prices
│       └── Use 10-day SMA
├── Volatility Adjustment Factor
│   ├── Calculate Realized Volatility
│   │   ├── Use High and Low Prices
│   │   └── Standard Deviation of Log Returns
│   ├── Smooth Realized Volatility
│   │   └── Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Realized Volatility
│   └── Adjust SMA with Smoothed Volatility
│       ├── Subtract Smoothed Volatility from SMA
│       └── Interpretable Output: Higher values suggest higher future returns with lower risk
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute Short-Term Average Close
│   │   └── Use 10-day Moving Average of Close prices
│   ├── Compute Long-Term Average Close
│   │   └── Use 60-day Moving Average of Close prices
│   └── Calculate the Difference Between Short-Term and Long-Term Averages
└── Calculate Volume Surge
    ├── Compute Short-Term Average Volume
    │   └── Use 10-day Moving Average of Volume
    ├── Compute Long-Term Average Volume
    │   └── Use 60-day Moving Average of Volume
    └── Calculate the Difference Between Short-Term and Long-Term Volumes
        ├── Positive Volume Difference
        └── Negative Volume Difference
