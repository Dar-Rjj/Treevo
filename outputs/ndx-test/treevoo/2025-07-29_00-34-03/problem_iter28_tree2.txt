Thought: Explore Moving Averages and Price Trends
- Thought: Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices
  - Action: SMA(Close, window=20)
- Thought: Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of closing prices
  - Action: EMA(Close, span=20)
- Thought: Determine the trend by comparing current price to moving averages
  - Thought: If current close is above both SMA and EMA, trend is bullish
    - Action: Bullish_Trend = (Close > SMA(Close, 20)) & (Close > EMA(Close, 20))
  - Thought: If current close is below both SMA and EMA, trend is bearish
    - Action: Bearish_Trend = (Close < SMA(Close, 20)) & (Close < EMA(Close, 20))

Thought: Analyze Price Volatility
- Thought: Calculate the standard deviation of closing prices over a period
  - Action: StdDev(Close, window=20)
- Thought: Determine if the volatility is increasing or decreasing
  - Thought: If the recent standard deviation is higher than the previous, volatility is increasing
    - Action: Volatility_Increasing = (StdDev(Close, 20) > Shift(StdDev(Close, 20), 1))
  - Thought: If the recent standard deviation is lower than the previous, volatility is decreasing
    - Action: Volatility_Decreasing = (StdDev(Close, 20) < Shift(StdDev(Close, 20), 1))

Thought: Assess Volume Changes
- Thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume
  - Action: Volume_Change = (Volume - Shift(Volume, 1)) / Shift(Volume, 1)
- Thought: Determine if there is a significant increase or decrease in volume
  - Thought: If the percentage change is greater than a threshold, volume is increasing
    - Action: Volume_Significant_Increase = (Volume_Change > 0.1)
  - Thought: If the percentage change is less than a negative threshold, volume is decreasing
    - Action: Volume_Significant_Decrease = (Volume_Change < -0.1)

Thought: Evaluate Price Gaps
- Thought: Identify if there is a price gap between today's open and yesterday's close
  - Action: Price_Gap = Open - Shift(Close, 1)
- Thought: Determine if the gap is significant
  - Thought: If the gap is greater than a threshold, it is a significant upward gap
    - Action: Significant_Upward_Gap = (Price_Gap > 0.05 * Shift(Close, 1))
  - Thought: If the gap is less than a negative threshold, it is a significant downward gap
    - Action: Significant_Downward_Gap = (Price_Gap < -0.05 * Shift(Close, 1))

Thought: Combine Factors for Predictive Power
- Thought: Create a composite factor combining trend, volatility, and volume changes
  - Action: Composite_Factor = Bullish_Trend + (-1 * Bearish_Trend) + Volatility_Increasing + (-1 * Volatility_Decreasing) + Volume_Significant_Increase + (-1 * Volume_Significant_Decrease) + Significant_Upward_Gap + (-1 * Significant_Downward_Gap)
