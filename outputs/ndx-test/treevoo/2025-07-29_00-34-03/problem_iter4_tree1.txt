Volume-Weighted Price Momentum with Volatility Adjustment
├── Compute Weighted Close Price
│   ├── Multiply Volume by Close Price
└── Calculate Adjusted SMA of Weighted Close Prices
    ├── Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Weighted Close Prices
    └── Smooth Realized Volatility
        ├── Use High and Low Prices for Realized Volatility
        │   └── Standard Deviation of Log Returns
        └── Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Realized Volatility
    └── Subtract Smoothed Volatility from SMA
        └── Interpretable Output: Higher values suggest higher future returns with lower risk
