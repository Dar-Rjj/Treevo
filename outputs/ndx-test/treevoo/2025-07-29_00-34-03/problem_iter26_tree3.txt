    - [Simple Moving Average Crossover]
      - Calculate the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices.
      - Calculate the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices.
      - Generate a signal when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA (Bullish), or below (Bearish).
    - [Relative Strength Index (RSI)]
      - Calculate the RSI over a 14-day period.
      - Use RSI to generate overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30) signals.
  - [Volume Analysis]
    - [On-Balance Volume (OBV)]
      - Calculate OBV: If the close is higher than the previous day, then add the current volume to OBV; if it is lower, subtract the current volume from OBV.
      - Generate a trend-following indicator by smoothing OBV with a 20-day SMA.
      - Signal is positive when the 20-day SMA of OBV is increasing, negative when it is decreasing.
    - [Volume Price Trend (VPT)]
      - Calculate VPT: Add the daily percentage change in price multiplied by the volume to the previous day's VPT.
      - Generate a trend-following signal by checking if the VPT is rising or falling.
- [Synthesize Indicators]
  - [Combined Momentum and Volume Factor]
    - For each day, combine the Bullish/Bearish signal from the SMA crossover, overbought/oversold signal from RSI, and the OBV/VPT trend signals.
    - Generate a final alpha factor as follows:
      - If all three signals are positive, set the alpha factor to 1.
      - If two out of three signals are positive, set the alpha factor to 0.5.
      - If one or none of the signals are positive, set the alpha factor to -1.
