Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
├── Use Close prices over the last 5 days
└── Compute the exponential moving average

Calculate Long-Term Price Momentum
├── Use Close prices over the last 20 days
└── Compute the exponential moving average

Determine the Difference between Short and Long-Term Momentum

Calculate Adjusted High-Low Range
├── Use High price
├── Use Low price
└── Scale by Volume
    ├── Use Volume
    └── Divide Volume by Exponential Moving Average of Last 20 Days' Volumes

Calculate Close-to-Open Return
├── Use Close price
└── Use Open price
    └── Subtract Open from Close

Calculate Intraday Volatility
└── High - Low

Calculate Previous Day's Return
├── Use Close price (current day)
└── Use Close price (previous day)
    └── Subtract Previous Close from Current Close

Adjust Short-Term Momentum
├── Subtract Long-Term Momentum from Short-Term Momentum
└── Divide by Intraday Volatility

Combine Factors
├── Multiply Adjusted High-Low Range by Scaled Volume
├── Inverse of Intraday Range
├── Combine Adjusted High-Low Range, Inversed Intraday Range, and Previous Day's Return
│   ├── Multiply Adjusted High-Low Range by Inversed Intraday Range
│   └── Add Previous Day's Return
└── Add Adjusted Short-Term Momentum

Final Alpha Factor
├── Combine Price Momentum and High-Low Range
│   ├── Add Scaled High-Low Range to the Difference in Price Momentum
├── Add Close-to-Open Return
└── Weight by Volume
    ├── Use Volume
    └── Multiply by Combined Factor
