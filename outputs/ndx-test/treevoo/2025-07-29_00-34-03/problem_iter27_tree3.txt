Thought: Develop alpha factors using price and volume data
- Thought: Calculate momentum-based factors
  - Thought: Determine the simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over N days
  - Thought: Evaluate the difference between the current closing price and the SMA as a factor
  - Thought: Analyze the rate of change (ROC) of closing prices over M days
  - Thought: Compute the exponential moving average (EMA) of closing prices over O days
  - Thought: Calculate the difference between the current closing price and the EMA as a factor
- Thought: Create volatility-based factors
  - Thought: Calculate the true range (highest high minus lowest low, or highest high/lowest close, or yesterday's close/lowest low) over K days
  - Thought: Sum the true ranges to find the Average True Range (ATR) over L days
  - Thought: Utilize the ATR as an indicator of volatility

  - Thought: Use the difference between the current close and VWAP as a factor
- Thought: Explore pattern recognition for alpha generation
  - Thought: Identify candlestick patterns (e.g., doji, hammer, engulfing) using open, high, low, and close prices
  - Thought: Score the presence of specific patterns as positive or negative factors based on their predictive power
  - Thought: Count the number of bullish and bearish reversal signals in the last R days
