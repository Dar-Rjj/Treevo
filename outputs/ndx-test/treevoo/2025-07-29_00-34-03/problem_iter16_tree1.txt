Crossover of Intraday Volatility Adjusted Momentum and Volume-Weighted Price Momentum with Enhanced Volatility and Volume Surge Adjustment
├── Calculate Intraday Volatility
│   └── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Short-Term Momentum
│   ├── Use Close prices from t-1 to t-4
│   ├── Calculate Average Close Price
│   │   └── Sum of last 4 days' Close prices divided by 4
│   ├── Calculate Current Momentum
│   │   └── Subtract Average from Current Close
│   └── Adjust Momentum by Intraday Volatility
│       └── Divide Current Momentum by Intraday Volatility
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Prices
│   ├── Multiply Volume by Close Price
│   └── Compute 10-day SMA of Weighted Close Prices
├── Calculate Realized Volatility
│   └── Standard Deviation of Log Returns using High and Low Prices
├── Smooth Realized Volatility
│   └── EMA of Realized Volatility
├── Adjust SMA with Smoothed Volatility
│   └── Subtract Smoothed Volatility from SMA
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Compute 10-day Moving Average of Close prices
│   ├── Compute 60-day Moving Average of Close prices
│   └── Calculate the Difference Between Short-Term and Long-Term Averages
├── Volume Surge Indicator
    ├── Calculate Volume Change
    │   └── Volume Change = Current Volume - Previous Volume
    ├── Volume Surge Filter
    │   └── Positive Volume Change above a Threshold
    └── Increase Alpha Factor if Volume Surge is detected
└── Combine Adjusted Momentum and Volume-Weighted Prices
    └── Add Adjusted Short-Term Momentum to Volume-Weighted Price SMA
