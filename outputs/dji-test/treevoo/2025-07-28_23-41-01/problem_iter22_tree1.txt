Integrated Intraday and Breakout Signals with Enhanced Momentum and Volume Considerations
├── Calculate Intraday Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Close Position in Range
│   ├── Use Close, Low, and Intraday Range
│   └── Divide (Close - Low) by Intraday Range
├── Calculate Daily Return
│   ├── Use Close and Previous Day's Close
│   └── Subtract and then Divide by Previous Day's Close
├── Weighted by Volume
│   ├── Multiply Volume by Daily Return
├── Combine Initial Factors
│   ├── Add Close Position in Range and Weighted Daily Return
├── Calculate Breakout Strength
│   ├── Use Current Day's High-Low Range
