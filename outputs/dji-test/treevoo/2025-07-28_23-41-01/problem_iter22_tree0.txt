Integrated Intraday and Breakout Signals with Enhanced Momentum and Volume Considerations Combined with Close-to-Open Returns and High-Low Range
├── Calculate Intraday Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Close Position in Range
│   ├── Divide (Close - Low) by Intraday Range
├── Calculate Daily Return
│   ├── Subtract and then Divide Close by Previous Day's Close
├── Weighted by Volume
│   ├── Multiply Volume by Daily Return
├── Combine Initial Factors
│   ├── Add Close Position in Range and Weighted Daily Return
├── Calculate Breakout Strength
│   ├── Divide Current Day's High-Low Range by 21-Day Rolling Sum of High-Low Range
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Multiply Volume by (Close - Open)
├── Integrate Volume-Weighted Return and Breakout Strength
│   ├── Add (Volume-Weighted Return * 0.4) and (Breakout Strength * 0.6)
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Average Daily Returns over a rolling 20-day period
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Add (Combined Volume-Weighted Return and Breakout Strength * 0.8) and (Price Momentum * 0.2)
    ├── Derive High-Low Range Signal
    │   ├── If Current Range > N-Day Average, Signal = 1; Else, Signal = 0
    └── Add High-Low Range Signal to Final Alpha Factor
