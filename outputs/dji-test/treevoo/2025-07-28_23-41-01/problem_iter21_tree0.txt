Alpha Mining for Predicting Future Stock Returns
- Momentum Indicators
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    - Calculate SMA for Close prices over a 50-day period
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    - Calculate EMA for Close prices over a 20-day period
  - Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Compute ROC for the Close price over 12 days
- Volume Indicators
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Accumulate OBV using volume and close price
- Volatility Indicator
  - True Range (TR)
    - Calculate TR from High, Low, and Previous Close
  - Average True Range (ATR)
    - Calculate ATR from TR over a 14-day period
- Price Patterns
  - Breakout
    - Identify breakout points by comparing today's High with the 20-day high
  - Reversal
    - Spot reversal patterns by analyzing the relationship between Open and Close
- Trend Indicators
  - Directional Movement Index (DMI)
    - Calculate +DI and -DI from High and Low over 14 days
  - Plus Directional Indicator (+DI)
    - Use +DI to measure positive trend strength
  - Minus Directional Indicator (-DI)
    - Use -DI to measure negative trend strength
- Composite Factors
  - Momentum and Volume
    - Combine SMA and OBV to create a new factor: SMA_OBV
  - Volatility and Trend
    - Create a composite indicator combining ATR and DMI
- Custom Indicators
  - High-Low Difference (HLDiff)
    - Calculate the daily difference between High and Low
  - Open-Close Ratio (OCRatio)
    - Calculate the ratio of Open to Close
  - Volume Weighted Price (VWP)
    - Calculate VWP as (High + Low + Close) / 3 * Volume
- Interpretable Alpha Factors
  - Momentum Strength
    - Define as the difference between 50-day SMA and 20-day EMA
  - Trend Confirmation
    - Define as the difference between +DI and -DI
  - Volume and Price Consistency
    - Define as the correlation between VWP and Close
  - Breakout Opportunity
    - Define as the number of days since the last breakout
