Thought: Alpha Mining through Intraday Price Patterns and Volume Analysis
    Sub-Thought: Calculate Momentum from Close Prices
        Sub-Thought: Compute the daily return as (Close - Open) / Open for each day
        Sub-Thought: Sum the daily returns over a 10-day window to capture medium-term momentum
    Sub-Thought: Analyze High-Low Range for Volatility Indicators
        Sub-Thought: Determine the True Range as max(High - Low, abs(High - Previous Close), abs(Low - Previous Close))
        Sub-Thought: Calculate an Average True Range over a 21-day period to assess long-term volatility
    Sub-Thought: Investigate Trading Volume Patterns
        Sub-Thought: Identify days with unusually high volume compared to a 30-day average
        Sub-Thought: Examine if high volume days coincide with positive or negative price changes
            Sub-Thought: If Positive, consider it as a strong buy signal
            Sub-Thought: If Negative, flag it as a potential sell-off
    Sub-Thought: Explore Price Gaps at Market Open
        Sub-Thought: Detect upward gaps where Today's Open is significantly higher than Yesterday's Close
        Sub-Thought: Detect downward gaps where Today's Open is significantly lower than Yesterday's Close
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the gap size as a percentage of the previous close to quantify the significance
    Sub-Thought: Incorporate Day-to-Day Price Movement Trends
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the rate of change between current close and previous close
        Sub-Thought: Categorize this rate of change into bins (e.g., -10% to -5%, -5% to -1%, etc.) to identify strong trends
        Sub-Thought: Assign a score based on the bin, with more extreme moves receiving higher scores
    Sub-Thought: Evaluate Volume-Price Correlation
        Sub-Thought: Measure the correlation coefficient between daily volume and close prices over a 30-day window
        Sub-Thought: Use a positive correlation as a sign of increasing investor interest
        Sub-Thought: Use a negative correlation as a sign of decreasing investor interest
    Sub-Thought: Analyze Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the VWAP by summing up the product of volume and price divided by the total volume
        Sub-Thought: Compare the current close price to the VWAP to determine if the stock is overvalued or undervalued
