- Sub-thought: Utilize Moving Averages to Identify Trends
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: SMA_5 (5-day window)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: SMA_20 (20-day window)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: SMA_50 (50-day window)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close Prices
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: EMA_5 (5-day window)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: EMA_20 (20-day window)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: EMA_50 (50-day window)

- Sub-thought: Analyze Momentum and Volatility
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate Rate of Change (ROC) Indicator
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: ROC_10 (10-day window)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: ROC_20 (20-day window)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate Bollinger Bands
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Upper Band (SMA_20 + 2 * Standard Deviation of 20-day Close Prices)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Lower Band (SMA_20 - 2 * Standard Deviation of 20-day Close Prices)

- Sub-thought: Use Volume to Confirm Price Trends
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: OBV Calculation Logic
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: CMF_20 (20-day window)

- Sub-thought: Incorporate High, Low, and Open Prices for Comprehensive Analysis
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate True Range (TR)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: TR Definition (max[(High - Low), abs(High - Previous Close), abs(Low - Previous Close)])
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate Average True Range (ATR)
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: ATR_14 (14-day window)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate William's %R
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: William's %R_14 (14-day window)

- Sub-thought: Combine Multiple Indicators to Form Composite Alpha Factors
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create Trend Strength Factor
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Trend Strength = SMA_20 - EMA_20
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create Volatility Factor
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Volatility Factor = Upper Band - Lower Band
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create Volume Confirmation Factor
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Volume Confirmation Factor = OBV * CMF_20
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create Price Action Factor
    - Sub-sub-sub-thought: Price Action Factor = (Close - Open) / ATR_14
