Thought: Comprehensive Alpha Mining through Intraday Price, Volume, and Momentum Analysis
├── Calculate Daily Returns
│   ├── Compute the daily return as (Close - Open) / Open for each day
│   └── Sum the daily returns over a 5-day window to capture short-term momentum
├── Analyze High-Low Range for Volatility Indicators
│   ├── Determine the True Range as max(High - Low, abs(High - Previous Close), abs(Low - Previous Close))
│   └── Calculate an Average True Range over a 14-day period to assess long-term volatility
├── Investigate Trading Volume Patterns
│   ├── Identify days with unusually high volume compared to a 20-day average
│   └── Examine if high volume days coincide with positive or negative price changes
│       ├── If Positive, consider it as a strong buy signal
│       └── If Negative, flag it as a potential sell-off
├── Explore Price Gaps at Market Open
│   ├── Detect upward gaps where Today's Open is significantly higher than Yesterday's Close
│   └── Detect downward gaps where Today's Open is significantly lower than Yesterday's Close
├── Categorize Day-to-Day Price Movement Trends
│   ├── Calculate the rate of change between current close and previous close
│   └── Assign a score based on the bin, with more extreme moves receiving higher scores
├── Evaluate Volume-Price Correlation
│   ├── Measure the correlation coefficient between daily volume and close prices over a 30-day window
│   └── Use a positive correlation as a sign of increasing investor interest
├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Daily Return
│   ├── Multiply Daily Price Change with Volume of day t
│   └── Sum over N days (e.g., 5, 10, 20)
│       ├── Use cumulative sum to add up multiplied values
│       └── Divide by total volume over N days
│           ├── Sum Volume over N days
│           └── Perform division
├── Introduce Enhanced Price Directional Component
│   ├── Calculate Close-Open Difference
│   │   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   │   └── Subtract Open price of day t
│   └── Determine Sign of the Close-Open Difference
├── Incorporate Dynamic Volume Spike Indicator
│   ├── Identify Volume Spikes
│   │   ├── Calculate the standard deviation of Volume over a rolling window (e.g., 20 days)
│   │   └── Flag days where Volume is above a dynamic threshold (e.g., mean + 2 * std_dev)
│   └── Adjust Volume-Weighted Daily Return for Volume Spikes
│       ├── For each day, if it is a Volume Spike day
│       └── Multiply the Volume-Weighted Daily Return by a dynamic factor (e.g., 1 + (Volume - mean) / std_dev)
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Use High price of day t
│   └── Subtract Low price of day t
├── Calculate Adjusted Volume
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Divide by High-Low Spread of day t
├── Calculate Log Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Use Close price of day t-1
├── Combine Adjusted Volume, Log Return, and Enhanced Price Direction
│   ├── Multiply Log Return by Adjusted Volume
│   ├── Multiply the Result by the Sign of the Close-Open Difference
│   └── Multiply the Result by the Sign of the High-Close Difference
├── Smooth the Combined Adjusted Volume, Log Return, and Enhanced Price Direction
│   ├── Use the combined result over the last 5 days
│   └── Compute the exponential moving average with a span of 5
└── Combine Components into Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Add the Volume-Weighted Daily Return and the smoothed combined result
    └── Incorporate Intraday Price Reversal
        ├── Calculate Intraday Price Reversal
        │   ├── Calculate the ratio of (High - Close) to (Close - Low)
        │   └── Determine the sign of the Intraday Price Reversal
        └── Adjust Final Alpha Factor
            ├── Multiply the Final Alpha Factor by the sign of the Intraday Price Reversal
            └── Add a small constant to handle zero division
