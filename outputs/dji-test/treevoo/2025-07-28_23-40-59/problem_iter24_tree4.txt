Thought: Use price and volume data to create alpha factors
- Subthought: Calculate return-based features from close prices
  - Subsubthought: Compute daily returns as (close_t / close_(t-1)) - 1
  - Subsubthought: Compute weekly returns as the cumulative product of daily returns over the last 5 trading days minus 1
- Subthought: Leverage high, low, open, and close for pattern recognition
  - Subsubthought: Formulate the true range as max(high_t - low_t, abs(high_t - close_(t-1)), abs(low_t - close_(t-1)))
  - Subsubthought: Generate the average true range (ATR) over the past 14 days using the true range
- Subthought: Incorporate volume into technical indicators
  - Subsubthought: Create a volume-weighted price as (high_t + low_t + close_t)/3 * volume_t
  - Subsubthought: Analyze the relationship between changes in volume and price movements
    - Subsubsubthought: Measure the correlation between daily log returns and the change in volume over the last 20 trading days
- Subthought: Explore price momentum and reversal signals
  - Subsubthought: Develop a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy
    - Subsubsubthought: Calculate the short-term SMA (e.g., 9-day) and long-term SMA (e.g., 26-day)
    - Subsubsubthought: Identify bullish and bearish crossovers
  - Subsubthought: Implement a relative strength index (RSI) to gauge overbought or oversold levels
    - Subsubsubthought: Calculate the RSI over the last 14 days based on the daily close prices
- Subthought: Investigate volatility and its impact on returns
  - Subsubthought: Estimate historical volatility using the standard deviation of daily returns over the past 20 days
  - Subsubthought: Examine the relationship between high volatility and subsequent returns
    - Subsubsubthought: Calculate the mean return following periods identified as having above-average volatility
- Subthought: Consider the impact of opening gaps on stock performance
  - Subsubthought: Determine the frequency and size of opening gaps, defined as open_t - close_(t-1)
  - Subsubthought: Evaluate the performance of stocks after significant gap openings
    - Subsubsubthought: Track the average return over the next 3, 5, and 10 trading days for stocks experiencing large gaps
