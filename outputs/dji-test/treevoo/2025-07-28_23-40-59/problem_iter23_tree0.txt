[Base Price Indicators]
- [Price Momentum Factor]
  - Calculate the daily return: (close_t / close_(t-1)) - 1
  - Calculate the average daily return over a window (e.g., 20 days): sum(daily_returns[t-19:t]) / 20
  - Use the average as the momentum factor
- [Price Reversal Factor]
  - Calculate the percentage change in price from the high and low of the previous day: (high_t - low_(t-1)) / low_(t-1)
  - This represents a reversal signal if the stock moves against the trend
- [Volume-based Strength]
  - Volume-weighted close: (close_t * volume_t) / sum(volume[t-4:t])
  - Compare with simple close to assess strength: (volume_weighted_close_t - close_t) / close_t
- [Price Volatility Factor]
  - Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a window (e.g., 20 days): stdev(daily_returns[t-19:t])
  - Higher volatility indicates higher risk but also potential for higher reward

[Combined Factors]
- [Momentum and Volatility Combined]
  - Combine the momentum factor with the volatility factor: (momentum_factor_t * volatility_factor_t)
  - This captures both the trend and the risk
- [Reversal and Strength Combined]
  - Combine the reversal factor with the strength factor: (reversal_factor_t * strength_factor_t)
  - This provides a signal for mean reversion and strength of the move
- [Integrated Alpha Score]
  - Integrate all factors: integrated_alpha = (momentum_and_volatility_combined_t + reversal_and_strength_combined_t) / 2
  - Final alpha score that synthesizes all aspects of price, volume, and behavior
