- Sub-Thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between today's close and the average close over the past N days
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price from one day to the next
- Sub-Thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Measure the standard deviation of the daily returns over the past M days
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over the past P days
- Sub-Thought: Volume and Amount Based Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Compute the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the last Q days
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the money flow index (MFI) using high, low, close prices, and volume over R days
- Sub-Thought: Pattern Recognition in OHLC Data
  - Sub-Thought: Identify doji patterns by comparing open and close values with a threshold

  - Sub-Thought: Use a weighted moving average (WMA) to emphasize more recent data points
- Sub-Thought: Oscillator Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Develop a custom oscillator by subtracting the N-day minimum low from the current close and dividing by the range
  - Sub-Thought: Create a stochastic oscillator based on the location of the close relative to the high-low range over T days
- Sub-Thought: Liquidity Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the liquidity by calculating the spread as the difference between the highest and lowest prices over U days
  - Sub-Thought: Assess volatility-adjusted liquidity through the use of Bollinger Bands
- Sub-Thought: Market Sentiment Indicators
