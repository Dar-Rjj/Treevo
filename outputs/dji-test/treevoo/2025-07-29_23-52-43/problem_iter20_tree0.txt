Thought: Synthesize Alpha Factors from Price, Volume, and Intraday Analysis

- Sub-thought: Calculate Daily Return
  - Sub-thought: Daily return = (Close - Open) / Open
  - Sub-thought: Use daily return in factor construction

- Sub-thought: Measure Intraday Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Intraday range = High - Low
  - Sub-thought: Intraday volatility = (High - Low) / (Close - Open)
  - Sub-thought: Incorporate intraday range and volatility in factor analysis

- Sub-thought: Analyze Closing Price Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Short-term momentum = (Close_t - Close_t-1) / Close_t-1
  - Sub-thought: Long-term momentum = (Close_t - Avg(Close_t-5...t-1)) / Avg(Close_t-5...t-1)
  - Sub-thought: Integrate both short-term and long-term momentum in factor construction

- Sub-thought: Examine Trading Volume Changes
  - Sub-thought: Volume change ratio = Volume_t / Volume_t-1
  - Sub-thought: Volume spike detection
    - Sub-thought: Spike threshold = 75th Percentile (Past 21 Days' Volume Changes) * 1.5
    - Sub-thought: Apply spike condition
  - Sub-thought: Integrate volume change and spike detection with other factors

- Sub-thought: Evaluate High and Low Prices
  - Sub-thought: High-to-low ratio = High / Low
  - Sub-thought: Price range = High - Low
  - Sub-thought: Trend strength = Max(Price Range over past 21 days) - Min(Price Range over past 21 days)
  - Sub-thought: Moving average of high-low differences (10-day period)
  - Sub-thought: Use the ratio, range, trend strength, and moving average in factor construction

- Sub-thought: Analyze Amount Traded
  - Sub-thought: Amount change ratio = Amount_t / Amount_t-1
  - Sub-thought: Combine with other factors for a comprehensive view

- Sub-thought: Intermediate Composite Factor
  - Sub-thought: ((Volume_t / Volume_t-1) * (Close_t - Avg(Close_t-5...t-1)) / (High_t - Low_t))

- Sub-thought: Volume Weighted Intraday Return
  - Sub-thought: (Close_t - Open_t) * (Volume_t / Volume_t-1)

- Sub-thought: Extended Composite Factor
  - Sub-thought: Intermediate Composite Factor
  - Sub-thought: Moving Average of High-Low Differences
  - Sub-thought: Trend Strength
  - Sub-thought: Intraday Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Volume Weighted Intraday Return

- Sub-thought: Final Composite Factor
  - Sub-thought: Extended Composite Factor
  - Sub-thought: Volume Spike Detection
  - Sub-thought: Volume Increase Ratio
