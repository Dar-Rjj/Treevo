├── Calculate Moving Sum of High-Low Differences
│   ├── Use 10-day period
│   └── Add up recent 10 days' differences
├── Calculate Intraday Momentum
│   ├── Compute Intraday High-Low Spread
│   │   ├── Use High price
│   │   └── Use Low price
│   └── Compute Previous Day's High-Low Spread
│       ├── Use High price of the previous day
│       └── Use Low price of the previous day
├── Compute Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
│   ├── Calculate Daily VWAP
