    ├── Combine Volume Increase, Close Price Momentum, Price Volatility, and Weighted Intraday-Breakout Composite
    │   ├── Use Volume Increase Ratio (Volume_t / Volume_t-1)
    │   ├── Use Close Price Momentum (Close_t - Avg(Close_t-5...t-1)) * (Volume_t / Avg(Volume_t-5...t-1))
    │   ├── Use Price Volatility (StdDev(Close_t-5...t) / Close_t-1)
    │   └── Use Combined Metrics (Sum of Intraday Return, Close-to-PreviousClose Return, and Breakout Intensity)
    └── Generate final factor
        ├── (Volume_t / Volume_t-1) * (Close_t - Avg(Close_t-5...t-1)) * (StdDev(Close_t-5...t) / Close_t-1) + Combined Metrics
