Thought: Synthesizing Price and Volume Data for Momentum and Activity Analysis
    - Sub-Thought: Analyzing Daily Price Movements with Intraday Return
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculating the Intraday Return
            - Calculation: (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Evaluating the Daily Volatility
            - Calculation: (High_t - Low_t) / Close_(t-1)
    - Sub-Thought: Incorporating Volume to Assess Trading Activity
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Identifying Volume Trend Changes
            - Calculation: (Volume_t - Volume_(t-1))
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Correlating Volume with Price Movement
            - Calculation: (Close_t - Open_t) / (Volume_t / Volume_(t-1))
    - Sub-Thought: Generating Momentum Factors
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Generate Factor 1
            - Calculation: Multiply Intraday Return by Volume Impact Score
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate Price and Intraday Momentum
            - Price Momentum
                - Get the most recent close
                - Get the close from 10 days ago
                - Compute the difference
            - Intraday Return
                - Use High and Low prices
                - Subtract Low from High, then divide by Low
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Confirm with Volume Trend
            - Compute Average Volume (Past 5 Days)
            - Get Current Day Volume
            - Compute Volume Ratio
                - Divide Current Day Volume by Average Volume
            - If Volume Ratio > 1.2
                - Multiply Price Momentum by Intraday Return (Factor 2)
    - Sub-Thought: Final Alpha Factor
        - Calculation: Multiply Factor 1 by Factor 2
        - Interpretation
            - Higher combined factor indicates stronger momentum with both volume and intraday confirmation
            - Lower combined factor suggests weaker momentum or less volume and intraday confirmation
    - Sub-Thought: Incorporating Financial Transaction Amounts for Depth
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Linking Transaction Size to Price Efficiency
            - Calculation: (Close_t - (Amount_t / Volume_t)) / Close_(t-1)
