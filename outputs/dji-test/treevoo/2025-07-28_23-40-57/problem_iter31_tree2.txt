Thought: Deriving Alpha Factors from Basic Price and Volume Data
    - Sub-Thought: Analyzing Daily Price Movements
        - Calculation: (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)  # Rate of Change in Close Prices
        - Calculation: (High_t - Low_t) / Close_(t-1)         # Daily Volatility
        - Calculation: (Open_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)   # Gap Opening Effect
    - Sub-Thought: Assessing Trading Activity through Volume
        - Calculation: Volume_t - Volume_(t-1)               # Volume Trend Changes
        - Calculation: (Close_t - Open_t) / (Volume_t / Volume_(t-1))  # Correlation of Volume with Price Movement
    - Sub-Thought: Incorporating Financial Transaction Amounts for Depth
        - Calculation: (Amount_t - Amount_(t-1)) / Amount_(t-1)  # Impact of Large Transactions
        - Calculation: (Close_t - (Amount_t / Volume_t)) / Close_(t-1)  # Linking Transaction Size to Price Efficiency
        - Calculation: Amount_t / Close_t  # Ratio of Amount to Close Price as a Liquidity Indicator
