Thought: Synthesizing Price, Volume, and Transaction Data for Enhanced Momentum and Activity Analysis
    - Sub-Thought: Analyzing Daily Price Movements and Intraday Return
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculating the Intraday Return
            - Calculation: (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Evaluating the Daily Volatility
            - Calculation: (High_t - Low_t) / Close_(t-1)
    - Sub-Thought: Incorporating Volume to Assess Trading Activity
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Identifying Volume Trend Changes
            - Calculation: (Volume_t - Volume_(t-1))
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Correlating Volume with Price Movement
            - Calculation: (Close_t - Open_t) / (Volume_t / Volume_(t-1))
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Volume Proportion
            - Use Volume_t
            - Subtract Overnight Volume (Volume_(t-1))
    - Sub-Thought: Generating Momentum Factors
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Generate Factor 1
            - Calculation: Multiply Intraday Return by Volume Impact Score
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate Price and Intraday Momentum
            - Price Momentum
                - Get the most recent close (Close_t)
                - Get the close from 10 days ago (Close_(t-10))
                - Compute the difference: Close_t - Close_(t-10)
            - Intraday Return
                - Use High and Low prices
                - Subtract Low from High, then divide by Low: (High_t - Low_t) / Low_t
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Confirm with Volume Trend
            - Compute Average Volume (Past 5 Days)
            - Get Current Day Volume (Volume_t)
            - Compute Volume Ratio: Volume_t / Average Volume
            - If Volume Ratio > 1.2
                - Multiply Price Momentum by Intraday Return (Factor 2)
            - Otherwise, set Factor 2 to 0
    - Sub-Thought: Adjusting for Cumulative Volume and Enhanced Volume Trend
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Compute Average Volume (Past 15 Days)
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Compute Volume Ratio (Current Day Volume / Average Volume)
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: If Volume Ratio > 1.5
            - Combine Momentum
                - Multiply Price Momentum by Intraday Return
            - Aggregate Momentum Over M Days
                - Use Cumulative Volume-Weighted Momentum
                - Sum over M days
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Otherwise, return 0.3 * (Price Momentum + Intraday Return)
    - Sub-Thought: Final Alpha Factor
        - Calculation: Multiply Factor 1 by Aggregate Momentum
        - Add Factor 2
        - Interpretation
            - Higher combined factor indicates stronger momentum with both volume and intraday confirmation
            - Lower combined factor suggests weaker momentum or less volume and intraday confirmation
    - Sub-Thought: Incorporating Financial Transaction Amounts for Depth
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Linking Transaction Size to Price Efficiency
            - Calculation: (Close_t - (Amount_t / Volume_t)) / Close_(t-1)
