        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Identifying Volume Trend Changes
            - Calculation: (Volume_t - Volume_(t-1))
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Correlating Volume with Price Movement
            - Calculation: (Close_t - Open_t) / (Volume_t / Volume_(t-1))
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume Impact Score
            - Calculation: 
                - Sum volume over 10 days
                - Average High price over 10 days
                - Average Low price over 10 days
                - Subtract Average Low from Average High
                - Divide by Sum of Volume
    - Sub-Thought: Generating Momentum Factors
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Generate Factor 1
            - Calculation: Multiply Intraday Return by Volume Impact Score
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate Price and Intraday Momentum
            - Price Momentum
                - Get the most recent close
                - Get the close from 10 days ago
                - Compute the difference
            - Intraday Return
                - Use High and Low prices
                - Subtract Low from High, then divide by Low
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Confirm with Volume Trend
            - Compute Average Volume (Past 5 Days)
            - Get Current Day Volume
            - Compute Volume Ratio
                - Divide Current Day Volume by Average Volume
            - If Volume Ratio > 1.2
                - Multiply Price Momentum by Intraday Return (Factor 2)
    - Sub-Thought: Final Alpha Factor
        - Calculation: Multiply Factor 1 by Factor 2
        - Interpretation
            - Higher combined factor indicates stronger momentum with both volume and intraday confirmation
            - Lower combined factor suggests weaker momentum or less volume and intraday confirmation
    - Sub-Thought: Incorporating Financial Transaction Amounts for Depth
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Investigating the Impact of Large Transactions
            - Calculation: (Amount_t - Amount_(t-1)) / Amount_(t-1)
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Linking Transaction Size to Price Efficiency
            - Calculation: (Close_t - (Amount_t / Volume_t)) / Close_(t-1)
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Examining the Ratio of Amount to Close Price as a Liquidity Indicator

    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Volume Proportion
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Subtract Overnight Volume
            - Calculation: (Previous Close Volume - Open Volume)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Volume Intensity
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Intraday Volume Proportion / (High - Low)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Weighted Intraday Volume Intensity
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Intraday Volume Intensity * Intraday Return
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday and Breakout Momentum
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: (High - Low) / Previous Close
    - Sub-Thought: Adjust by Volume
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Adjusted Momentum = Momentum / Cumulative Volume (Sum of Volumes Over N Days)
    - Sub-Thought: Aggregate Momentum Over M Days
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Use Cumulative Volume-Weighted Momentum
        - Sub-Sub-Thought: Sum over M days
