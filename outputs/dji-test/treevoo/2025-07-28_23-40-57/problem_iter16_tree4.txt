- Calculate moving average of close prices over 20 days (MA20)
  - Subtract MA20 from close price to get a signal
    - If the signal is positive, it indicates a bullish trend
    - If the signal is negative, it indicates a bearish trend
- Calculate the difference between high and low prices as daily volatility
  - Divide this difference by the close price to normalize (Not Allowed: Ignored)
  - Instead, use the raw difference as an indicator of volatility
- Compute the ratio of volume to the 20-day moving average of volume (VMA20)
  - A value significantly higher than 1 indicates high trading activity relative to the past
  - A value significantly lower than 1 signals reduced trading interest
- Track the change in closing price from t-1 to t
  - A positive change suggests momentum in the upward direction
  - A negative change indicates a downward trend
- Examine the ratio of close price at t to the open price at t
  - A ratio greater than 1 suggests intraday strength
  - A ratio less than 1 points to intraday weakness
