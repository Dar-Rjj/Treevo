Thought: Constructing Alpha Factors using Price and Volume Data
- Thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
    - Sub-Thought: Short-term SMA (e.g., 5 days)
    - Sub-Thought: Long-term SMA (e.g., 20 days)
  - Thought: SMA Crossover Signal
    - Sub-Thought: When short-term SMA crosses above long-term SMA, signal buy
    - Sub-Thought: When short-term SMA crosses below long-term SMA, signal sell
- Thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Thought: True Range (TR)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate TR as the maximum of (High-Low), |High-Close|, and |Low-Close|
  - Thought: Average True Range (ATR)
    - Sub-Thought: Averaging the true range over a certain period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Thought: Volatility Trend
    - Sub-Thought: Use ATR to identify periods of high or low volatility
- Thought: Volume-based Indicators
  - Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Sub-Thought: Increase OBV if the close price is higher than the previous close, by the volume amount
    - Sub-Thought: Decrease OBV if the close price is lower than the previous close, by the volume amount
  - Thought: Volume Spike
    - Sub-Thought: Identify days with volume significantly higher than a moving average
- Thought: Price Pattern Indicators
  - Thought: Inside Bar Pattern
    - Sub-Thought: Day t's high is lower than day t-1’s high, and day t's low is higher than day t-1’s low
  - Thought: Outside Bar Pattern
    - Sub-Thought: Day t's high is higher than day t-1’s high, and day t's low is lower than day t-1’s low
  - Thought: Bullish Engulfing Pattern
    - Sub-Thought: Day t-1 closes red (Close < Open) and day t closes green (Close > Open) with a higher open and a lower close than day t-1
  - Thought: Bearish Engulfing Pattern
    - Sub-Thought: Day t-1 closes green (Close > Open) and day t closes red (Close < Open) with a lower open and a higher close than day t-1
- Thought: Integrated Indicators
  - Thought: Combining Momentum and Volume
    - Sub-Thought: Look for upward momentum confirmed by positive volume trends
  - Thought: Combining Volatility and Patterns
    - Sub-Thought: Analyze patterns like inside/outside bars in high/low volatility contexts
  - Thought: Composite Factor
    - Sub-Thought: Assign weights to different indicators based on their historical performance
    - Sub-Thought: Create a composite score that combines various indicator signals
