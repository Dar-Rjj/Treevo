Improved Price and Volume Momentum Factor with Enhanced Volatility and Trend Adjustment
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close price
├── Evaluate Momentum Over Time
│   ├── Sum of Daily Price Changes over a Window (e.g., 10 days)
└── Compute Volume Weighted Momentum
    ├── Multiply Sum of Daily Price Changes by Current Day's Volume
    └── Divide by Average Volume Over Time
        ├── Sum of Volumes over the same Window
└── Adjust for Volume Spike Indicator
    ├── Compare Current Day's Volume to Moving Average of Volumes (e.g., 10 days)
    ├── If Current Day's Volume exceeds a threshold (e.g., 1.5 * Moving Average)
    │   └── Apply a multiplier (e.g., 1.2) to the Volume Weighted Momentum
└── Adjust for Volatility
    ├── Calculate Historical Volatility as Standard Deviation of Daily Price Changes
    │   ├── Use Daily Price Changes over a Window (e.g., 10 days)
    │   └── Compute the Standard Deviation
    ├── Compare Current Day's Absolute Price Change to Historical Volatility
    ├── If Current Day's Absolute Price Change exceeds a threshold (e.g., 2 * Historical Volatility)
    │   └── Apply a multiplier (e.g., 1.3) to the Volume Weighted Momentum
└── Adjust for Long-Term Price Momentum
    ├── Select Close price at t-20
    └── Subtract from Close price at t
└── Adjust for Volume Trend
    ├── Calculate 20-day Moving Average Volume
    │   ├── Sum Volume from t-19 to t
    │   └── Divide by 20
    └── Subtract 20-day Moving Average Volume from Current Volume at t
└── Combine All Adjustments
    ├── Multiply Long-Term Price Momentum by Volume Weighted Momentum
    ├── Multiply the Result by Volume Trend Adjustment
    └── Apply Softmax to Ensure Positive Factor
        └── If Result < 0, apply exp(Result) / (1 + exp(Result))
