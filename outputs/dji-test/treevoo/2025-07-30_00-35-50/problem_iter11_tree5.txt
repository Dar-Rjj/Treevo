├── Calculate Daily Return
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Previous Day's Close price
├── Calculate Price Gap
│   ├── Use Open price
│   └── Previous Day's Close price
├── Adjust Daily Return by Price Gap
│   ├── Subtract/Add Price Gap to/from Daily Return
│   └── Apply Exponential Decay to Adjustment (half-life = 1 day)
├── Calculate High-to-Low Price Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Calculate Price Range Momentum
│   ├── Current Period High-to-Low Range
│   └── Previous Period High-to-Low Range
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Combine High-Low Spread with Volume Change
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   ├── Subtract previous day's Volume from current day's Volume
│   └── Multiply High-Low Spread by Volume Change if Volume Change is positive
├── Apply Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│   ├── Use Combined High-Low Spread with Volume Change
│   └── Set SMA period to 5 days
├── Adjust by Volume Change
│   ├── Current Period Volume
│   └── Previous Period Volume
├── Calculate Accumulated Volume Impact
│   ├── Sum of Volume over the Last 5 Days
│   └── Use as a Weight for Daily Return Adjustment
├── Synthesize Final Alpha Factor
