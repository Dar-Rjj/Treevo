Incorporating Price and Volume into High-Low Momentum with Enhanced Confirmation
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Analyze Volume Trend
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   ├── Subtract previous day's Volume from current day's Volume
│   ├── Determine Volume Direction
│   │   ├── If Volume Change > 0, Volume is Increasing
│   │   └── If Volume Change < 0, Volume is Decreasing
│   └── Adjust High-Low Spread with Volume
│       ├── If Volume is Increasing, Multiply High-Low Spread by (Volume Change / Previous Volume)
│       └── If Volume is Decreasing, Divide High-Low Spread by (Previous Volume - Volume Change)
├── Incorporate Price Confirmation
│   ├── Calculate Price Change
│   │   ├── Subtract previous day's Close price from current day's Close price
│   ├── Determine Price Direction
│   │   ├── If Price Change > 0, Price is Increasing
│   │   └── If Price Change < 0, Price is Decreasing
│   ├── Combine High-Low Spread, Volume, and Price
│   │   ├── If Price is Increasing and Volume is Increasing, Multiply High-Low Spread by (Price Change + Volume Change)
│   │   ├── If Price is Decreasing and Volume is Decreasing, Multiply High-Low Spread by -(Price Change + Volume Change)
│   │   ├── If Price and Volume are in opposite directions, Multiply High-Low Spread by (Price Change - Volume Change)
└── Apply Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
    ├── Use Combined High-Low Spread, Volume, and Price
    └── Set WMA period to 5 days
