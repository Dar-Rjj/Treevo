Crossover Enhanced Momentum and Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread Factor
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close price from Current Day's Close price
├── Evaluate Momentum Over Time
│   └── Sum of Daily Price Changes over a Window (e.g., 10 days)
├── Compute Volume Weighted Momentum
│   ├── Multiply Sum of Daily Price Changes by Current Day's Volume
│   └── Divide by Average Volume Over the Same Window
│       └── Sum of Volumes over the same Window
├── Integrate Volume Spike Indicator
│   ├── Compare Current Day's Volume to Moving Average of Volumes (e.g., 10 days)
│   ├── If Current Day's Volume exceeds a threshold (e.g., 1.5 * Moving Average)
│   │   └── Apply a multiplier (e.g., 1.2) to the Volume Weighted Momentum
│   └── If not, keep the Volume Weighted Momentum unchanged
├── Adjust for Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Historical Volatility as Standard Deviation of Daily Price Changes
│   │   └── Use Daily Price Changes over the same Window (e.g., 10 days)
│   ├── Compare Current Day's Absolute Price Change to Historical Volatility
│   ├── If Current Day's Absolute Price Change exceeds a threshold (e.g., 2 * Historical Volatility)
│   │   └── Apply a multiplier (e.g., 1.3) to the Volume Weighted Momentum
│   └── If not, keep the Volume Weighted Momentum unchanged
├── Calculate Price and High-to-Low Range Momentum
│   ├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   │   └── Calculate 5-day Exponential Moving Average
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Day's 5-day Exponential Moving Average
│   └── Calculate High-to-Low Price Range Momentum
│       ├── Calculate High-to-Low Price Range
│       │   ├── Use High price
│       │   └── Use Low price
│       └── Combine Current and Previous Period High-to-Low Ranges
├── Confirm High-Low Spread with Volume and Adjusted by Amount Acceleration
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Calculate difference between current and previous day
│   └── Calculate Amount Acceleration
│       ├── Use Amount
│       │   └── Calculate 5-day Exponential Moving Average
│       └── Subtract Previous Day's 5-day Exponential Moving Average
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Spread by Volume Change
│   └── Ensure positive volume change
│   ├── Adjust with Amount Acceleration
│       └── Multiply Combined High-Low Spread and Volume Change by Amount Acceleration
├── Smoothing Filter
│   ├── Apply Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│   │   ├── Use Combined High-Low Spread, Volume Change, and Amount Acceleration
│   │   └── Set SMA period to 5 days
├── Integrate Momentum and Smoothed Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
│   ├── Multiply Price and High-to-Low Range Momentum by Smoothed Volume-Adjusted High-Low Spread
└── Final Alpha Factor
