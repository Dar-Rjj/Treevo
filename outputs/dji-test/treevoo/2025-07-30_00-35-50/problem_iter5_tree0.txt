Integrated Price and High-Low Momentum with Volume Dynamics
├── Calculate Close Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Moving Average
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's 5-day Moving Average
├── Calculate High-Low Price Spread
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│   └── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Calculate Volume Acceleration
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Calculate 5-day Moving Average
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's 5-day Moving Average
├── Confirm High-Low Spread with Volume Change
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   ├── Use Volume
│   │   └── Calculate difference between current and previous day
│   └── Multiply High-Low Spread by Volume Change
├── Adjust for Volume Trend
│   ├── Calculate 10-day Moving Average Volume
│   │   ├── Sum Volume from t-9 to t
│   │   └── Divide by 10
│   └── Subtract 10-day Moving Average Volume from Current Volume at t
├── Combine Close Price Momentum, High-Low Spread, and Volume Dynamics
│   ├── Multiply Close Price Momentum by Volume Acceleration
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Spread by Volume Change
│   └── Add the two products
│   └── Multiply by Volume Trend
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Apply Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    │   ├── Use Combined Alpha Factor
    │   └── Set SMA period to 5 days
    └── Ensure Positive Factor
        └── If Result < 0, set to 0
