Synthesized and Integrated Alpha Factor: Enhanced Momentum, Volume, and Price Change with Dynamic Adjustments
├── Calculate Daily Return
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close price from Current Close price
├── Adjust Daily Return by Price Gap
│   ├── Calculate Price Gap
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close price from Current Open price
│   ├── If Price Gap > 0
│   │   └── Subtract Price Gap from Daily Return, Apply Exponential Decay (half-life = 1 day)
│   ├── If Price Gap < 0
│   │   └── Add Price Gap to Daily Return, Apply Exponential Decay (half-life = 1 day)
├── Calculate High-to-Low Price Range
│   └── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Calculate Price Range Momentum
│   └── Subtract Previous Period High-to-Low Range from Current High-to-Low Range
├── Calculate Close Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract Close price at t-10 from Current Close price
├── Adjust by Volume and Volume-Weighted Price Change
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   └── Subtract Previous Period Volume from Current Period Volume
│   └── Calculate Volume-Weighted Price Change
│       └── Multiply (Current Close price - Previous Close price) by Current Period Volume
├── Integrate Momentum, Volume, and Volume-Weighted Price Change
│   ├── Multiply Price Range Momentum by Volume Change
│   └── Add Result to Volume-Weighted Price Change
├── Combine Integrated Factor with Volume Change
│   └── Multiply Integrated Factor by Volume Change (Ensure positive volume change)
├── Smoothing Filter
│   └── Apply 5-day Simple Moving Average to Combined Integrated Factor
├── Calculate 5-day Exponential Moving Average for Price
│   └── Use Close price
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract Previous 5-day EMA of Close Price from Current 5-day EMA of Close Price
├── Calculate 5-day Exponential Moving Average for Volume
│   └── Use Volume
├── Calculate Volume Acceleration
│   └── Subtract Previous 5-day EMA of Volume from Current 5-day EMA of Volume
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Multiply Volume Acceleration by Price Momentum
│   └── Add Integrated Momentum, Volume, and Price Change
├── Final Alpha Factor with Volume Weighting
│   ├── Divide the result by the sum of the last 5 days' volumes
│   ├── Add Integrated Range Momentum and Integrated Close Price Momentum
│   └── Ensure Positive Factor (If Result < 0, set to 0)
