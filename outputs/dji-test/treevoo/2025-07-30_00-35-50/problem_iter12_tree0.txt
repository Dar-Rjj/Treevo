Thought: Utilize basic price and volume data to create momentum and volatility factors.
  Thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over a certain period.
    Thought: Use a 20-day period for SMA to capture medium-term trends.
  Thought: Measure the relative strength index (RSI) to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
    Thought: Apply a 14-day RSI to balance sensitivity with stability.
  Thought: Develop a volatility factor using the standard deviation of daily returns.
    Thought: Compute the standard deviation over a 20-day window to match the SMA period.
  Thought: Create a volume trend indicator by looking at the change in average volume.
    Thought: Calculate the average volume over a 10-day period and then compute the percentage change from the previous day.
  Thought: Combine the above factors to create a composite alpha factor.
    Thought: Sum the Z-scores of the 20-day SMA, 14-day RSI, 20-day standard deviation, and 10-day volume change.
      Thought: Ensure that each factor is given equal weight in the composite score.
  Thought: Introduce a new factor based on the difference between the high and low prices.
    Thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over a 14-day period.
    Thought: Normalize ATR by dividing it by the 20-day SMA of the closing price.
  Thought: Explore the relationship between the open and close prices to create an intraday momentum factor.
    Thought: Calculate the percentage change from the open to the close price.
    Thought: Smooth this percentage change over a 5-day period to reduce noise.
  Thought: Consider the interaction between the intraday momentum and the ATR-based factor.
    Thought: Multiply the smoothed open-to-close percentage change by the normalized ATR.
    Thought: This combined factor should highlight strong intraday moves in the context of recent volatility.
  Thought: Evaluate the performance of the composite alpha factor with and without the ATR-based and intraday momentum factors.
    Thought: Compare the Sharpe ratios of the two versions of the composite alpha factor.
    Thought: Select the version with the higher Sharpe ratio for further analysis.
