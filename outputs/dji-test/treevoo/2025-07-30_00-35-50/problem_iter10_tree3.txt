Daily Momentum and Volume Activity Factor with Enhanced Volatility Adjustment
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close price from Current Day's Close price
├── Evaluate Momentum Over Time
│   └── Sum of Daily Price Changes over a Window (e.g., 10 days)
└── Compute Volume Weighted Momentum
    ├── Multiply Sum of Daily Price Changes by Current Day's Volume
    └── Divide by Average Volume Over the Same Window
        └── Sum of Volumes over the same Window
└── Integrate Volume Spike Indicator
    ├── Compare Current Day's Volume to Moving Average of Volumes (e.g., 10 days)
    ├── If Current Day's Volume exceeds a threshold (e.g., 1.5 * Moving Average)
    │   └── Apply a multiplier (e.g., 1.2) to the Volume Weighted Momentum
    └── If not, keep the Volume Weighted Momentum unchanged
└── Adjust for Volatility
    ├── Calculate Historical Volatility as Standard Deviation of Daily Price Changes
    │   └── Use Daily Price Changes over the same Window (e.g., 10 days)
    ├── Compare Current Day's Absolute Price Change to Historical Volatility
    ├── If Current Day's Absolute Price Change exceeds a threshold (e.g., 2 * Historical Volatility)
    │   └── Apply a multiplier (e.g., 1.3) to the Volume Weighted Momentum
    └── If not, keep the Volume Weighted Momentum unchanged
