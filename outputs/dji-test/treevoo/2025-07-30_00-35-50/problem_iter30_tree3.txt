Thought: Develop a Momentum Indicator
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Return over Different Periods
  - Sub-thought: Short-Term Momentum (e.g., 5-day Return)
    - Sub-thought: Use the logarithmic return (log(Close_t / Close_(t-5)))
  - Sub-thought: Medium-Term Momentum (e.g., 20-day Return)
    - Sub-thought: Use the logarithmic return (log(Close_t / Close_(t-20)))
  - Sub-thought: Long-Term Momentum (e.g., 100-day Return)
    - Sub-thought: Use the logarithmic return (log(Close_t / Close_(t-100)))

Thought: Develop a Volume Trend Indicator
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Volume Change Over Different Periods
  - Sub-thought: Short-Term Volume Change (e.g., 5-day Change)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume (Volume_t / Volume_(t-5) - 1)
  - Sub-thought: Medium-Term Volume Change (e.g., 20-day Change)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume (Volume_t / Volume_(t-20) - 1)
  - Sub-thought: Long-Term Volume Change (e.g., 100-day Change)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume (Volume_t / Volume_(t-100) - 1)

Thought: Develop a Volatility Indicator
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Historical Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Daily Log Returns
    - Sub-thought: Calculate daily log returns (log(Close_t / Close_(t-1)))
  - Sub-thought: Standard Deviation of Log Returns
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the standard deviation of daily log returns over a period (e.g., 20 days)

Thought: Develop a Price Oscillator
- Sub-thought: Moving Average Crossover
  - Sub-thought: Short-Term Moving Average (e.g., 5-day SMA)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the 5-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_5)
  - Sub-thought: Long-Term Moving Average (e.g., 20-day SMA)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_20)
  - Sub-thought: Price Oscillator
    - Sub-thought: Subtract the long-term SMA from the short-term SMA (SMA_5 - SMA_20)

Thought: Develop a Price-Volume Relationship Indicator
- Sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
  - Sub-thought: Calculate OBV
    - Sub-thought: Initialize OBV to zero
    - Sub-thought: If Close_t > Close_(t-1), add Volume_t to OBV
    - Sub-thought: If Close_t < Close_(t-1), subtract Volume_t from OBV
    - Sub-thought: If Close_t == Close_(t-1), do nothing

Thought: Develop a Range Indicator
- Sub-thought: True Range
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the True Range
    - Sub-thought: True Range = max(High_t, Close_(t-1)) - min(Low_t, Close_(t-1))
  - Sub-thought: Average True Range (ATR)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ATR over a period (e.g., 14 days)
      - Sub-thought: ATR = Sum of True Ranges over the period / Number of periods
