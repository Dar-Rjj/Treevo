Performing alpha mining to generate novel and interpretable alpha factors that could help predict future stock returns.
|
|---Thought 1: Explore price patterns as a potential factor
|   |---Subthought 1.1: Calculate the difference between high and low prices of the day t
|   |---Subthought 1.2: Evaluate the change in close price from day t-1 to day t
|   |---Subthought 1.3: Analyze the trend of open prices over the last 5 trading days
|   |---Subthought 1.4: Investigate the relationship between the open and close prices on day t
|
|---Thought 2: Investigate volume-related indicators
|   |---Subthought 2.1: Measure the daily volume change from day t-1 to day t
|   |---Subthought 2.2: Look into the total trade amount's impact, considering its change from day t-1
|   |---Subthought 2.3: Examine the average volume over the past 5 days
|   |---Subthought 2.4: Consider the ratio of day t's volume to the average volume over the past 5 days
|
|---Thought 3: Develop composite factors by combining different metrics
|   |---Subthought 3.1: Integrate price volatility (high-low) with volume change for a new indicator
|   |---Subthought 3.2: Mix the momentum of close prices with the trend in trading volume
|   |---Subthought 3.3: Combine the relationship between open and close prices with the volume ratio
|
|---Thought 4: Focus on specific patterns or anomalies
|   |---Subthought 4.1: Identify significant gaps between the open and previous close prices
|   |---Subthought 4.2: Detect unusual spikes in volume compared to the recent average
|   |---Subthought 4.3: Look for consistent patterns where the close is higher/lower than the open for several consecutive days
|   |---Subthought 4.4: Analyze the instances where the closing price is exactly at the high or low of the day
