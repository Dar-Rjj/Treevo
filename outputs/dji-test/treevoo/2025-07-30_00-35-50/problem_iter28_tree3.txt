Thought: Use price and volume information to derive momentum and volatility-based alpha factors
  |
  |--Sub-Thought: Calculate short-term (e.g., 5-day) and long-term (e.g., 20-day) moving averages of close prices
  |     |
  |     |--Action: Subtract the 5-day moving average from the 20-day moving average to capture short-term versus long-term trends
  |
  |--Sub-Thought: Compute the ratio of today's close price to the average close price over a past period (e.g., 10 days)
  |     |
  |     |--Action: Directly use this ratio as a measure of recent price strength
  |
  |--Sub-Thought: Measure the volatility using the standard deviation of log returns over a specified period (e.g., 10 days)
  |     |
  |     |--Action: Utilize this as an indicator of market uncertainty or risk
  |
  |--Sub-Thought: Evaluate the accumulation/distribution line by considering the daily volume and the position of the closing price within the day's range
  |     |
  |     |--Action: Sum this daily value over a period (e.g., 30 days) to gauge buying versus selling pressure
  |
  |--Sub-Thought: Investigate the change in open interest or trade volume over different time horizons (e.g., comparing current day to 1-week, 1-month ago)
  |     |
  |     |--Action: The direction and magnitude of these changes can indicate shifts in investor sentiment
  |
  |--Sub-Thought: Create a composite signal by combining elements from the above factors
  |     |
  |     |--Action: For example, weigh the short-term versus long-term trend, recent price strength, and market uncertainty to form a single score
