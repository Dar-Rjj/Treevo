Synthesized Alpha Factor: Enhanced Integrated Momentum, Acceleration, and High-Low Dynamics with Volume and Price Change Adjustments
├── Calculate Daily Return
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close price
├── Calculate Price Gap
│   ├── Use Open price
│   └── Subtract Previous Day's Close price
├── Adjust Daily Return by Price Gap
│   ├── If Price Gap > 0
│   │   └── Subtract Price Gap from Daily Return
│   └── If Price Gap < 0
│       └── Add Price Gap to Daily Return
├── Evaluate Short-Term Momentum
│   ├── Sum of Adjusted Daily Returns over a Short Window (e.g., 5 days)
├── Compute Volume Weighted Short-Term Momentum
│   ├── Multiply Sum of Adjusted Daily Returns by Current Day's Volume
│   └── Divide by Average Volume Over the Short Window
│       ├── Sum of Volumes over the Short Window
├── Adjust for Volume Spike Indicator
│   ├── Compare Current Day's Volume to Moving Average of Volumes (e.g., 10 days)
│   ├── If Current Day's Volume exceeds a threshold (e.g., 1.5 * Moving Average)
│       └── Apply a multiplier (e.g., 1.2) to the Volume Weighted Short-Term Momentum
├── Adjust for Volatility
│   ├── Calculate Historical Volatility as Standard Deviation of Adjusted Daily Returns
│   │   ├── Use Adjusted Daily Returns over a Short Window (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   └── Compute the Standard Deviation
│   ├── Compare Current Day's Absolute Adjusted Daily Return to Historical Volatility
│   ├── If Current Day's Absolute Adjusted Daily Return exceeds a threshold (e.g., 2 * Historical Volatility)
│       └── Apply a multiplier (e.g., 1.3) to the Volume Weighted Short-Term Momentum
├── Calculate High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Confirm with Volume
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   ├── Subtract previous day's Volume from current day's Volume
│   └── Adjust High-Low Spread with Volume
│       ├── If Volume Change > 0, Multiply High-Low Spread by (Volume Change / Average Volume)
├── Incorporate Price Confirmation
│   ├── Calculate Price Change
│   │   ├── Subtract previous day's Close price from current day's Close price
│   └── Combine High-Low Spread, Volume, and Price
│       ├── If Price Change > 0 and Volume Change > 0, Multiply High-Low Spread by (Price Change + Volume Change)
├── Adjust for Long-Term Price Momentum
│   ├── Select Close price at t-20
│   └── Subtract from Close price at t
├── Adjust for Volume Trend
│   ├── Calculate 20-day Moving Average Volume
│   │   ├── Sum Volume from t-19 to t
│   │   └── Divide by 20
│   └── Subtract 20-day Moving Average Volume from Current Volume at t
├── Combine All Adjustments
│   ├── Multiply Long-Term Price Momentum by Volume Weighted Short-Term Momentum
│   ├── Multiply the Result by Volume Trend Adjustment
│   └── Adjust the Result by High-Low Spread
│       ├── If Result > 0, add High-Low Spread
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Apply Softmax to Ensure Positive Factor
    │   └── If Result < 0, apply exp(Result) / (1 + exp(Result))
