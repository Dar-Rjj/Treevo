Thought: Begin with basic price and volume data to construct initial alpha factors
- Sub-Thought: Calculate the return based on Close prices
  - Sub-Thought: Simple daily return (Close_t / Close_{t-1} - 1)
  - Sub-Thought: Logarithmic daily return (log(Close_t) - log(Close_{t-1}))
- Sub-Thought: Utilize Volume data for identifying significant trading days
  - Sub-Thought: Volume change percentage (Volume_t / Volume_{t-1} - 1)
  - Sub-Thought: Volume surprise factor (Volume_t - Average(Volume_{t-20:t-1}))
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate Open, High, Low, and Close to create technical indicators
  - Sub-Thought: True range (max(High_t - Low_t, abs(High_t - Close_{t-1}), abs(Low_t - Close_{t-1})))
  - Sub-Thought: Average true range (Simple moving average of True range over 14 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Accumulation/Distribution (ADL) line
    - Formula: ((Close_t - Low_t) - (High_t - Close_t)) / (High_t - Low_t) * Volume_t
  - Sub-Thought: Money Flow Index (MFI)
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Raw money flow (Typical Price * Volume)
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: Positive and Negative Money Flow
    - Sub-Sub-Thought: MFI calculation (Positive Money Flow / (Positive + Negative Money Flow) * 100)
- Sub-Thought: Use price and volume momentum to forecast future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Rate of Change (ROC) for Close prices (Close_t / Close_{t-25} - 1)
  - Sub-Thought: On-balance Volume (OBV)
    - If Close_t > Close_{t-1}, OBV = OBV_{t-1} + Volume_t
    - If Close_t < Close_{t-1}, OBV = OBV_{t-1} - Volume_t
    - Else, OBV = OBV_{t-1}
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate pattern recognition in price movements
  - Sub-Thought: Detecting bullish and bearish engulfing patterns
  - Sub-Thought: Identification of hammer and hanging man candlestick patterns
- Sub-Thought: Analyze relationship between price movement and traded amount
  - Sub-Thought: Daily traded amount change (Amount_t / Amount_{t-1} - 1)
  - Sub-Thought: Ratio of traded amount to volume (Amount_t / Volume_t)
- Sub-Thought: Explore the concept of volatility
  - Sub-Thought: Historical Volatility (Standard Deviation of daily returns over a period)
  - Sub-Thought: Implied Volatility (Theoretical, not directly calculable from provided data but can be inferred through option pricing models if available)
- Sub-Thought: Combine multiple factors to form composite alpha signals
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Weighted combination of simple daily return, logarithmic daily return, and ROC
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Composite volume-based signal (weighted sum of volume change percentage and volume surprise factor)
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Composite technical indicator (weighted sum of ADL, MFI, and OBV)
- Sub-Thought: Introduce lagged and lead-lag relationships
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Lagged simple daily return (Close_{t-1} / Close_{t-2} - 1)
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Lead-lag relationship between volume and price (Correlation between Volume_{t-1} and Close_t)
- Sub-Thought: Consider market microstructure
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Tick rule (Sign of (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) * Volume_t)
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Bid-ask spread (Estimated from Open, High, Low, and Close)
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate inter-day price patterns
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Intraday return (Close_t / Open_t - 1)
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Intraday range (High_t - Low_t)
- Sub-Thought: Explore price-volume relationships
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Price-volume trend (Correlation between Close and Volume over a period)
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Price-volume divergence (Divergence between moving averages of Close and Volume)
