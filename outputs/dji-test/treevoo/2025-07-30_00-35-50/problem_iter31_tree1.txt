Thought: Develop Momentum-based Alpha Factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate Price Momentum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the difference between the current close price and the close price n periods ago
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the percentage change in close price over the last n periods
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Momentum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the difference between the current volume and the volume n periods ago
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the percentage change in volume over the last n periods
- Sub-thought: Calculate Combined Momentum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Combine price momentum and volume momentum through a weighted sum
  - Sub-sub-thought: Use a simple moving average (SMA) of the combined momentum to smooth out short-term fluctuations
- Sub-thought: Identify Trend Reversals
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create a factor that flags when the price momentum changes sign, indicating a potential trend reversal
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create a factor that flags when the volume momentum changes sign, signaling a possible shift in buying or selling pressure
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Momentum Consistency
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the number of consecutive periods where the momentum is positive or negative
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute a score based on the length of consecutive momentum periods
