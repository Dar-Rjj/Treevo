Thought: Generate alpha factors using raw price and volume data for predictive stock returns.
- Sub-Thought: Create a factor based on the momentum of closing prices.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in close prices from t to t-1, t-2, ..., t-n and average them.
- Sub-Thought: Explore the relationship between high and low prices with market volatility.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Develop a factor by calculating the average true range (ATR) over n days without normalization.
- Sub-Thought: Analyze buying and selling pressure through the analysis of open and close prices.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Formulate a bull/bear strength indicator by comparing today's close to the previous day's close and open.
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate volume into the alpha generation process to identify unusual activity.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Create a volume shock factor by observing the difference between the current day's volume and the median of the last n days' volumes.
- Sub-Thought: Combine price and volume information to detect significant market movements.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Construct an On-Balance Volume (OBV) factor to measure cumulative buying and selling pressure over time without any normalization or use of global statistics.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Develop a money flow index (MFI) alternative, which is the ratio of positive to negative money flow over n periods, focusing only on the given data set without normalization.
- Sub-Thought: Examine the efficiency of the market using the concept of fractal efficiency.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Craft a fractal efficiency factor by measuring the ratio of the net price movement to the total distance covered (from open to close across n days), strictly using data up to time t.
- Sub-Thought: Explore the impact of gaps between consecutive days on future stock performance.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Create a gap analysis factor by evaluating the difference between the current day's opening price and the previous day's closing price, tracking this over n days.
- Sub-Thought: Leverage the concept of support and resistance levels identified through historical open, high, low, and close prices.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Design a support/resistance breakout factor that identifies when the close price breaches a critical level determined by the highest highs or lowest lows in the preceding n bars.
