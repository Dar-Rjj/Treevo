Explore Advanced Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume Data
- Utilize Open, High, Low, Close Prices
  - Calculate Intraday Volatility
    - Use Formula: (High - Low) / Close
  - Identify Price Reversal Patterns
    - Detect Bullish/Bearish Engulfing Patterns
      - Define Conditions for Pattern Recognition
        - Bullish: Today's close > Yesterday's open AND Today's open < Yesterday's close
        - Bearish: Today's close < Yesterday's open AND Today's open > Yesterday's close
  - Compute Average True Range
    - Use Formula: ATR = (1/n) * ∑(True Range)
      - Where True Range = max(High - Low, abs(High - Previous Close), abs(Low - Previous Close))
- Analyze Volume Data
  - Compute Changes in Trading Volume
    - Use Formula: (Volume(t) - Volume(t-1)) / Volume(t-1)
  - Examine Volume Spike Events
    - Set Threshold to Identify Significant Volume Increases
    - Use Formula: If (Volume(t) > k * Volume(t-1)), then Flag as Spike
- Combine Price and Volume Analysis
  - Create Composite Alpha Factors
    - Factor 1: Intraday Volatility * Volume Change
    - Factor 2: Presence of Price Reversal * Volume Change
- Evaluate Historical Performance
  - Backtest Generated Alpha Factors
    - Use Walk-Forward Analysis
      - Split Data into Training and Testing Periods
    - Implement Cross-Validation
      - Perform Time Series Cross-Validation
  - Assess Predictive Power
    - Measure Correlation with Future Returns
      - Focus on Short-Term Prediction (e.g., Next Day)
    - Use Sharpe Ratio
      - Calculate Sharpe Ratio for Portfolio
- Refine and Iterate
  - Adjust Parameters Based on Backtesting Results
  - Explore Additional Price and Volume-Based Features
  - Incorporate Market Sentiment
    - Integrate News Sentiment Scores
      - Use External APIs for Sentiment Analysis
  - Use Machine Learning Models
    - Train Models on Historical Data
      - Use Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks
