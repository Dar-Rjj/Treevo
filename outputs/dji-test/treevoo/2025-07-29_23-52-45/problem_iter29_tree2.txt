Explore Novel and Interpretable Alpha Factors for Predicting Future Stock Returns
- Utilize Open, High, Low, Close Prices
  - Calculate Intraday Volatility
    - Use Formula: (High - Low) / Close
  - Identify Price Reversal Patterns
    - Detect Bullish/Bearish Engulfing Patterns
      - Define Conditions for Pattern Recognition
        - Bullish: Today's close > Yesterday's open AND Today's open < Yesterday's close
        - Bearish: Today's close < Yesterday's open AND Today's open > Yesterday's close
  - Examine Price Patterns
    - Determine if there is a higher high and lower low pattern in the last 5 days
- Analyze Volume Data
  - Compute Changes in Trading Volume
    - Use Formula: (Volume(t) - Volume(t-1)) / Volume(t-1)
  - Examine Volume Spike Events
    - Set Threshold to Identify Significant Volume Increases
    - Use Formula: If (Volume(t) > k * Volume(t-1)), then Flag as Spike
  - Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Use Formula: VWAP = Sum(Price * Volume) / Sum(Volume)
  - Investigate Volume-related factors
    - Compute the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the past 10 days
    - Measure the cumulative volume over a window, say 20 days
- Combine Price and Volume Analysis
  - Create Composite Alpha Factors
    - Factor 1: Intraday Volatility * Volume Change
    - Factor 2: Presence of Price Reversal * Volume Change
- Explore Momentum indicators
  - Calculate simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over a 10-day period
  - Evaluate the difference between today's close and the SMA
- Analyze the relationship between Open and Close Prices
  - Calculate the percentage change from the opening to the closing price
  - Create a flag for up days (close > open)
- Look into Range and Volatility
  - Daily range (high - low), and its average over the last 10 days
  - Difference between the daily range and the 10-day average range
- Consider the Impact of Gaps
  - Identify gaps by comparing today's open to yesterday's close
  - Classify as an up gap (open > previous close) or down gap (open < previous close)
- Evaluate Historical Performance
  - Backtest Generated Alpha Factors
    - Use Walk-Forward Analysis
      - Split Data into Training and Testing Periods
    - Implement Cross-Validation
      - Perform Time Series Cross-Validation
  - Assess Predictive Power
    - Measure Correlation with Future Returns
      - Focus on Short-Term Prediction (e.g., Next Day)
    - Use Sharpe Ratio
      - Calculate Sharpe Ratio for Portfolio
- Refine and Iterate
  - Adjust Parameters Based on Backtesting Results
  - Explore Additional Price and Volume-Based Features
  - Develop Custom Indicators
    - Create New Indicators Based on Observed Patterns
      - Example: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) with custom parameters
