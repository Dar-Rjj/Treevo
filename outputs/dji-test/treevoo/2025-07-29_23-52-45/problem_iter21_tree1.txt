Explore Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume Data
- Utilize Open, High, Low, Close Prices
  - Calculate Daily Returns
    - Use Formula: (Close - Open) / Open
  - Identify Price Patterns
    - Detect Bullish/Bearish Engulfing Patterns
      - Define Conditions for Pattern Recognition
        - Bullish: Today's close > Today's open AND Yesterday's close < Yesterday's open
        - Bearish: Today's close < Today's open AND Yesterday's close > Yesterday's open
    - Detect Harami Patterns
      - Define Conditions for Pattern Recognition
        - Bullish: Today's body is contained within the prior day's body and Today's close > Today's open
        - Bearish: Today's body is contained within the prior day's body and Today's close < Today's open
- Analyze Volume Data
  - Compute Changes in Trading Volume
    - Use Formula: (Volume(t) - Volume(t-1)) / Volume(t-1)
  - Examine Volume Spike Events
    - Set Threshold to Identify Significant Volume Increases
- Combine Price and Volume Analysis
  - Create Composite Alpha Factors
    - Factor 1: Daily Return * Volume Change
    - Factor 2: Presence of Price Pattern * Volume Change
    - Factor 3: Harami Pattern * Volume Change
- Evaluate Historical Performance
  - Backtest Generated Alpha Factors
    - Use Walk-Forward Analysis
      - Split Data into Training and Testing Periods
  - Assess Predictive Power
    - Measure Correlation with Future Returns
      - Focus on Short-Term Prediction (e.g., Next Day)
  - Incorporate Additional Metrics
    - Sharpe Ratio
    - Information Ratio
- Refine and Iterate
  - Adjust Parameters Based on Backtesting Results
  - Explore Additional Price and Volume-Based Features
  - Introduce Machine Learning Models
    - Use Ensemble Methods
      - Random Forest
      - Gradient Boosting
    - Feature Importance Analysis
