Thought: Synthesis of Price, Volume, and Momentum for Advanced Alpha Factor Generation
-Subthought: Incorporate Close Price Dynamics
--Subthought: Calculate the Daily Return based on Close Prices
---Subthought: Compute the difference between today's close price and yesterday's close price
----Subthought: Use this daily return as a factor, reflecting short-term momentum
--Subthought: Identify Reversals with Close Price
---Subthought: Determine if today's close is higher or lower than the previous day's high or low
----Subthought: If a reversal is identified, use it as a signal for a potential trend change
-Subthought: Leverage Volume for Trading Signals
--Subthought: Analyze Changes in Volume
---Subthought: Calculate the change in volume from one day to the next
----Subthought: Use this change in volume as an indicator of increased interest or exhaustion
--Subthought: Detect Volume Surges
---Subthought: Compare current day's volume against the average volume over the past n days
----Subthought: Mark significant surges in volume as factors, potentially indicating a strong move
-Subthought: Combine Price and Volume for Enhanced Signal
--Subthought: Develop a Price-Volume Indicator
---Subthought: Create a metric that combines a form of daily return with a measure of volume change
----Subthought: This combined metric serves as a more robust signal, capturing both price action and trading activity
-Subthought: Calculate Short-Term Return
--Subthought: Use Close price of day t
--Subthought: Subtract and divide by Close price of day (t-5)
-Subthought: Calculate Long-Term Return
--Subthought: Use Close price of day t
--Subthought: Subtract and divide by Close price of day (t-60)
-Subthought: Volume-Weighted Short-Term Return
--Subthought: Use calculated Short-Term Return
--Subthought: Multiply by Volume of day t
-Subthought: Volume-Weighted Long-Term Return
--Subthought: Use calculated Long-Term Return
--Subthought: Multiply by Volume of day t
-Subthought: Intraday Volatility
--Subthought: Use High price of day t
--Subthought: Use Low price of day t
---Subthought: Subtract Low from High
----Subthought: Take Absolute Value
-Subthought: Adjusted Volume-Weighted Short-Term Return
--Subthought: Use Volume-Weighted Short-Term Return
--Subthought: Divide by Intraday Volatility
-Subthought: Adjusted Volume-Weighted Long-Term Return
--Subthought: Use Volume-Weighted Long-Term Return
--Subthought: Divide by Intraday Volatility
-Subthought: Combined Adjusted Momentum Factor
--Subthought: Weighted Sum of Adjusted Volume-Weighted Short-Term and Long-Term Returns
---Subthought: Use a Fixed Weight for Volume-Weighted Short-Term Return
---Subthought: Use a Fixed Weight for Volume-Weighted Long-Term Return
-Subthought: Reversal Indicator
--Subthought: Invert the sign of Combined Adjusted Momentum Factor
-Subthought: Smoothed Reversal Indicator
--Subthought: Compute 3-day Simple Moving Average of Reversal Indicator
-Subthought: Calculate 5-Day Moving Average of Close Price
--Subthought: Compute the average of Close prices from day t-4 to day t
-Subthought: Calculate 60-Day Moving Average of Close Price
--Subthought: Compute the average of Close prices from day t-59 to day t
-Subthought: Trend Indicator
--Subthought: Subtract 5-Day Moving Average from 60-Day Moving Average
-Subthought: Final Alpha Factor
--Subthought: Add Smoothed Reversal Indicator to Trend Indicator
-Subthought: Daily Price Momentum
--Subthought: Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close.
--Subthought: Use this difference as a simple momentum signal.
-Subthought: Intraday Volatility Ratio
--Subthought: Compute the ratio of today’s high to today’s low.
--Subthought: This ratio can indicate intraday volatility, which might be related to future returns.
-Subthought: Bullish Sentiment
--Subthought: Determine the difference between today’s high and yesterday’s close.
--Subthought: A large difference could suggest bullish sentiment.
-Subthought: Bearish Sentiment
--Subthought: Calculate the difference between today’s low and yesterday’s close.
--Subthought: A large difference could suggest bearish sentiment.
-Subthought: Volume Change
--Subthought: Calculate the difference between today’s volume and yesterday’s volume.
--Subthought: A significant increase in volume could indicate strong market interest.
-Subthought: Volume Activity Ratio
