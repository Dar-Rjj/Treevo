│   ├── Add Smoothed Reversal Indicator to Trend Indicator
├── Daily Price Momentum
│   ├── Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close.
│   └── Use this difference as a simple momentum signal.
├── Intraday Volatility Ratio
│   ├── Compute the ratio of today’s high to today’s low.
│   └── This ratio can indicate intraday volatility, which might be related to future returns.
├── Bullish Sentiment
│   ├── Determine the difference between today’s high and yesterday’s close.
│   └── A large difference could suggest bullish sentiment.
├── Bearish Sentiment
│   ├── Calculate the difference between today’s low and yesterday’s close.
│   └── A large difference could suggest bearish sentiment.
├── Volume Change
│   ├── Calculate the difference between today’s volume and yesterday’s volume.
│   └── A significant increase in volume could indicate strong market interest.
├── Volume Activity Ratio
│   ├── Compute the ratio of today’s volume to the average volume over the past n days.
│   └── This ratio can help identify unusual trading activity, which may be predictive of future movements.
├── Composite Price-Volume Momentum
│   ├── Multiply the difference between today’s close and yesterday’s close by the ratio of today’s volume to the average volume.
│   └── This factor combines price momentum with volume confirmation.
├── Adjusted Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Divide the ratio of today’s high to today’s low by the difference in volume between today and yesterday.
│   └── This factor adjusts intraday volatility by recent changes in trading volume.
├── Longer-Term Moving Average
│   ├── Calculate the moving average of the close price over the past n days.
│   └── The moving average can smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends.
├── Slope of Moving Average
│   ├── Determine the slope of the moving average over the past n days.
│   └── The slope can indicate the direction and strength of the trend.
├── Relative Position to Moving Average
│   ├── Compare today’s close price to the longer-term moving average.
│   └── A close above the moving average may suggest a continuation of the upward trend.
└── Opening Gap Analysis
    ├── Calculate the difference between today’s open and yesterday’s close.
    └── Gaps at the open can indicate overnight news or sentiment changes.
