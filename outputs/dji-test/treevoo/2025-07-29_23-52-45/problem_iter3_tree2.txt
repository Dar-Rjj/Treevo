├── Compute Moving Averages of High-Low Range
│   ├── Apply Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│   │   └── Set lookback period to 10 days
│   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
│   │   └── Set smoothing factor to 0.2
│   └── Apply Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
│       └── Set weights for the last 5 days
