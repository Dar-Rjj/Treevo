Thought: Synthesize Intraday Volatility, Price Momentum, and Trend-Reversal Indicators for Enhanced Predictive Alpha Generation
-Subthought: Calculate Intraday Volatility
--Subthought: Use High and Low prices
---Subthought: Subtract Low from High
----Subthought: Take Absolute Value
-Subthought: Determine Price Momentum
--Subthought: Use Close Prices over a Lookback Period
---Subthought: Compute the Percentage Change
----Subthought: (Close price of day t - Close price of day (t-1)) / Close price of day (t-1)
-Subthought: Integrate Volume and Price Momentum
--Subthought: Analyze Changes in Volume
---Subthought: Calculate the change in volume from one day to the next
----Subthought: Use this change in volume as an indicator of increased interest or exhaustion
--Subthought: Detect Volume Surges
---Subthought: Compare current day's volume against the average volume over the past n days
----Subthought: Mark significant surges in volume as factors, potentially indicating a strong move
--Subthought: Volume-Weighted Short-Term Return
---Subthought: (Close price of day t - Close price of day (t-5)) / Close price of day (t-5) * Volume of day t
--Subthought: Volume-Weighted Long-Term Return
---Subthought: (Close price of day t - Close price of day (t-60)) / Close price of day (t-60) * Volume of day t
-Subthought: Adjust Returns by Intraday Volatility
--Subthought: Adjusted Volume-Weighted Short-Term
---Subthought: Volume-Weighted Short-Term / Intraday Volatility
--Subthought: Adjusted Volume-Weighted Long-Term
---Subthought: Volume-Weighted Long-Term / Intraday Volatility
-Subthought: Combined Adjusted Momentum Factor
--Subthought: Adjusted Volume-Weighted Short-Term - Adjusted Volume-Weighted Long-Term
-Subthought: Reversal Indicator
--Subthought: -Combined Adjusted Momentum Factor
-Subthought: Moving Averages for Trend Analysis
--Subthought: 5-Day Moving Average of Close Price
---Subthought: Compute the average of Close prices from day t-4 to day t
--Subthought: 20-Day Moving Average of Close Price
---Subthought: Compute the average of Close prices from day t-19 to day t
--Subthought: 60-Day Moving Average of Close Price
---Subthought: Compute the average of Close prices from day t-59 to day t
--Subthought: Trend Indicator
---Subthought: 5-Day Moving Average - 60-Day Moving Average
--Subthought: Additional Trend Indicator
---Subthought: 20-Day Moving Average - 60-Day Moving Average
-Subthought: Final Alpha Factor
--Subthought: Reversal Indicator + Trend Indicator + Additional Trend Indicator
-Subthought: Additional Price and Volume Factors
--Subthought: Daily Price Movement
---Subthought: Close price of day t - Open price of day t
--Subthought: Uptrend Count
---Subthought: Count of days in the past 10 days where Close > Open
--Subthought: Average True Range (ATR)
---Subthought: ATR over the last 10 days using high, low, and close prices
--Subthought: ATR Moving Average
---Subthought: 20-day moving average of ATR
--Subthought: ATR Signal
---Subthought: If current ATR < 20-day moving average
--Subthought: Trading Volume Relative to Price
---Subthought: Positive Volume Score
----Subthought: Count of days in the past 30 days where (Close > Open) and (Volume > 30-day average volume)
--Subthought: Intraday Bullishness
---Subthought: (High price of day t - Open price of day t) / (Open price of day t - Low price of day t)
--Subthought: Bullishness Ratio
---Subthought: Average of Intraday Bullishness over the past 5 days
-Subthought: Combined Indicator
--Subthought: (Momentum Factor + Uptrend Count + ATR Signal + Positive Volume Score + Bullishness Ratio) / 5
--Subthought: Final Alpha Factor
---Subthought: Reversal Indicator + Trend Indicator + Additional Trend Indicator + Combined Indicator
