Thought: Calculate the difference between the close price and the open price as a simple measure of daily price movement.
    Sub-thought: Count the number of days in the past 10 days where the close was higher than the open. This count gives a short-term momentum indication.
        Sub-thought: Use the count as a factor, where a higher count suggests a stronger upward trend.
Thought: Measure the volatility by calculating the average true range (ATR) over the last 10 days using high, low, and close prices.
    Sub-thought: If the current ATR is below the 20-day moving average, it may suggest decreased volatility, which can be a contrarian buy signal.
Thought: Examine the trading volume relative to the price movement.
    Sub-thought: On days with a positive price change, check if the volume is above the 30-day average. This combination might indicate strong buying pressure.
        Sub-thought: Assign a positive score for each day meeting both conditions in the past 30 days. The sum of these scores can serve as a factor.
Thought: Analyze the relationship between the highest and lowest prices of the day.
    Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of (high - open) / (open - low) as a measure of intraday bullishness or bearishness.
        Sub-thought: Use this ratio as a factor, where a higher value indicates a more bullish market condition.
Thought: Combine the factors from the previous thoughts to create a composite alpha factor.
    Sub-thought: Create a weighted sum of the factors from the previous thoughts.
        Sub-thought: The combined factor should provide a more robust signal by incorporating multiple aspects of price and volume behavior.
