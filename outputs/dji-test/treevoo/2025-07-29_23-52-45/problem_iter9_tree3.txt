        Sub-thought: Use the 12-day momentum as an alpha factor

Thought: Evaluate the Volume Trend
    Sub-thought: Calculate the 5-day volume simple moving average (SMA)
        Sub-thought: Subtract the 5-day SMA from the current day's volume (volume[t] - SMA_5_volume[t])
            Sub-thought: Use the difference as an alpha factor to capture unusual trading activity

Thought: Analyze the Open and Close Price Relationship
    Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of close price to open price (close_price[t] / open_price[t])
        Sub-thought: Use this ratio as an alpha factor, indicating market sentiment for the day

Thought: Identify Volatility with High-Low Range
    Sub-thought: Calculate the high-low range (high_price[t] - low_price[t])
        Sub-thought: Use the high-low range as a measure of daily volatility
            Sub-thought: Incorporate this volatility measure into an alpha factor that reflects market uncertainty

Thought: Examine the Trading Amount to Volume Ratio
    Sub-thought: Compute the amount-to-volume ratio (amount[t] / volume[t])
        Sub-thought: Use this ratio as an alpha factor, which can indicate the average transaction size or liquidity
