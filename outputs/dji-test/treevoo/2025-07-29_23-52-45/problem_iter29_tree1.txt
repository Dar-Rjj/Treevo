Explore Advanced and Synthesized Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume Data
- Utilize Open, High, Low, Close Prices
  - Calculate Intraday Volatility
    - Use Formula: (High - Low) / Close
  - Identify Price Reversal Patterns
    - Detect Bullish/Bearish Engulfing Patterns
      - Define Conditions for Pattern Recognition
        - Bullish: Today's close > Yesterday's open AND Today's open < Yesterday's close
        - Bearish: Today's close < Yesterday's open AND Today's open > Yesterday's close
- Analyze Volume Data
  - Compute Changes in Trading Volume
    - Use Formula: (Volume(t) - Volume(t-1)) / Volume(t-1)
  - Examine Volume Spike Events
    - Set Threshold to Identify Significant Volume Increases
    - Use Formula: If (Volume(t) > k * Volume(t-1)), then Flag as Spike
  - Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Use Formula: VWAP = Sum(Price * Volume) / Sum(Volume)
- Combine Price and Volume Analysis
  - Create Composite Alpha Factors
    - Factor 1: Intraday Volatility * Volume Change
    - Factor 2: Presence of Price Reversal * Volume Change
- Calculate Short-Term Return
  - Use Close price of day t
  - Subtract and divide by Close price of day (t-5)
- Calculate Long-Term Return
  - Use Close price of day t
  - Subtract and divide by Close price of day (t-60)
- Volume-Weighted Short-Term Return
  - Use calculated Short-Term Return
  - Multiply by Volume of day t
- Volume-Weighted Long-Term Return
  - Use calculated Long-Term Return
  - Multiply by Volume of day t
- Adjusted Volume-Weighted Short-Term Return
  - Use Volume-Weighted Short-Term Return
  - Divide by Intraday Volatility
- Adjusted Volume-Weighted Long-Term Return
  - Use Volume-Weighted Long-Term Return
  - Divide by Intraday Volatility
- Combined Adjusted Momentum Factor
  - Weighted Sum of Adjusted Volume-Weighted Short-Term and Long-Term Returns
    - Use a Fixed Weight for Volume-Weighted Short-Term Return
    - Use a Fixed Weight for Volume-Weighted Long-Term Return
- Reversal Indicator
  - Invert the sign of Combined Adjusted Momentum Factor
- Smoothed Reversal Indicator
  - Compute 3-day Simple Moving Average of Reversal Indicator
- Calculate 5-Day Moving Average of Close Price
  - Compute the average of Close prices from day t-4 to day t
- Calculate 60-Day Moving Average of Close Price
  - Compute the average of Close prices from day t-59 to day t
- Trend Indicator
  - Subtract 5-Day Moving Average from 60-Day Moving Average
- Final Alpha Factor
  - Add Smoothed Reversal Indicator to Trend Indicator
- Daily Price Momentum
  - Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close.
- Composite Price-Volume Momentum
  - Multiply the difference between today’s close and yesterday’s close by the ratio of today’s volume to the average volume.
- Evaluate Historical Performance
  - Backtest Generated Alpha Factors
    - Use Walk-Forward Analysis
      - Split Data into Training and Testing Periods
    - Implement Cross-Validation
      - Perform Time Series Cross-Validation
  - Assess Predictive Power
    - Measure Correlation with Future Returns
      - Focus on Short-Term Prediction (e.g., Next Day)
    - Use Sharpe Ratio
      - Calculate Sharpe Ratio for Portfolio
- Refine and Iterate
  - Adjust Parameters Based on Backtesting Results
  - Explore Additional Price and Volume-Based Features
  - Develop Custom Indicators
    - Create New Indicators Based on Observed Patterns
      - Example: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) with custom parameters
