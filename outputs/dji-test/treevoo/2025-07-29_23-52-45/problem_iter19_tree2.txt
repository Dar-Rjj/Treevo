Thought: Calculate the difference between today's closing price and the moving average of the last 5 days' closing prices to measure short-term momentum.
    Sub-thought: Utilize the daily return (close price of day t - close price of day t-1) as a factor to reflect immediate market sentiment.
        Sub-thought: Incorporate the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the last 5 days, calculated as sum(volume * close) / sum(volume), to identify potential institutional trading activities.
            Sub-thought: Factor in the ratio of the highest price to the lowest price within the same day (high/low) as a measure of intraday volatility.
                Sub-thought: Use the change in VWAP from day t-5 to day t (VWAP_t - VWAP_(t-5)) to gauge recent shifts in buying or selling pressure.
                    Sub-thought: Consider the cumulative sum of daily returns over the past 5 days to capture short-term trends.
