Thought: Calculate the Momentum of Close Price
    Sub-thought: Compute 12-day close price momentum (close_price[t] - close_price[t-12])
        Sub-thought: Use the 12-day momentum as an alpha factor
            Sub-thought: Calculate the 12-day percentage change in close price ((close_price[t] - close_price[t-12]) / close_price[t-12])
                Sub-thought: Use the 12-day percentage change as an additional alpha factor

Thought: Evaluate the Volume Trend
    Sub-thought: Calculate the 5-day volume simple moving average (SMA)
        Sub-thought: Subtract the 5-day SMA from the current day's volume (volume[t] - SMA_5_volume[t])
            Sub-thought: Use the difference as an alpha factor to capture unusual trading activity
                Sub-thought: Calculate the 5-day percentage change in volume ((volume[t] - SMA_5_volume[t]) / SMA_5_volume[t])
                    Sub-thought: Use the 5-day percentage change in volume as an additional alpha factor

Thought: Analyze the Open and Close Price Relationship
    Sub-thought: Compute the ratio of close price to open price (close_price[t] / open_price[t])
        Sub-thought: Use this ratio as an alpha factor, indicating market sentiment for the day
            Sub-thought: Calculate the 5-day simple moving average of the close-to-open ratio (SMA_5_close_to_open_ratio[t])
                Sub-thought: Subtract the 5-day SMA of the close-to-open ratio from the current day's close-to-open ratio (close_to_open_ratio[t] - SMA_5_close_to_open_ratio[t])
                    Sub-thought: Use this difference as an alpha factor to capture unusual daily price movement

Thought: Identify Volatility with High-Low Range
    Sub-thought: Calculate the high-low range (high_price[t] - low_price[t])
        Sub-thought: Use the high-low range as a measure of daily volatility
            Sub-thought: Calculate the 5-day simple moving average of the high-low range (SMA_5_high_low_range[t])
                Sub-thought: Subtract the 5-day SMA of the high-low range from the current day's high-low range (high_low_range[t] - SMA_5_high_low_range[t])
                    Sub-thought: Use this difference as an alpha factor to capture unusual daily volatility

Thought: Examine the Trading Amount to Volume Ratio
    Sub-thought: Compute the amount-to-volume ratio (amount[t] / volume[t])
        Sub-thought: Use this ratio as an alpha factor, which can indicate the average transaction size or liquidity
            Sub-thought: Calculate the 5-day simple moving average of the amount-to-volume ratio (SMA_5_amount_to_volume_ratio[t])
                Sub-thought: Subtract the 5-day SMA of the amount-to-volume ratio from the current day's amount-to-volume ratio (amount_to_volume_ratio[t] - SMA_5_amount_to_volume_ratio[t])
                    Sub-thought: Use this difference as an alpha factor to capture unusual changes in transaction size
