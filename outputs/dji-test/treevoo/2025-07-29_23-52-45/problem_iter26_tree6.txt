Thought: Synthesize novel and interpretable alpha factors for predicting future stock returns.
├── Daily Price Movement and Momentum
│   ├── Calculate the difference between the close price and the open price of day t.
│   ├── Count the number of days in the past 10 days where the close was higher than the open.
│   │   └── Use this count as a factor, where a higher count suggests a stronger upward trend.
├── Volatility and ATR Analysis
│   ├── Measure the volatility by calculating the Average True Range (ATR) over the last 10 days.
│   ├── If the current ATR is below the 20-day moving average, it may suggest decreased volatility.
│   │   └── This can be a contrarian buy signal.
├── Volume-Weighted Returns
│   ├── Short-Term Return
│   │   ├── (Close price of day t - Close price of day (t-5)) / Close price of day (t-5)
│   ├── Long-Term Return
│   │   ├── (Close price of day t - Close price of day (t-60)) / Close price of day (t-60)
│   ├── Volume-Weighted Short-Term
│   │   ├── Short-Term Return * Volume of day t
│   ├── Volume-Weighted Long-Term
│   │   ├── Long-Term Return * Volume of day t
│   ├── Intraday Volatility
│   │   ├── Absolute(High price of day t - Low price of day t)
│   ├── Adjusted Volume-Weighted Short-Term
│   │   ├── Volume-Weighted Short-Term / Intraday Volatility
│   ├── Adjusted Volume-Weighted Long-Term
│   │   ├── Volume-Weighted Long-Term / Intraday Volatility
├── Price and Volume Analysis
│   ├── On days with a positive price change, check if the volume is above the 30-day average.
│   │   └── Assign a positive score for each day meeting both conditions in the past 30 days.
│   │       └── The sum of these scores can serve as a factor.
├── Intraday Bullishness/Bearishness
│   ├── Compute the ratio of (high - open) / (open - low) as a measure of intraday bullishness or bearishness.
│   │   └── Use this ratio as a factor, where a higher value indicates a more bullish market condition.
├── Combined Alpha Factor
│   ├── Create a weighted sum of the factors from the previous thoughts.
│   │   └── The combined factor should provide a more robust signal by incorporating multiple aspects of price and volume behavior.
├── Momentum Factor
│   ├── Adjusted Volume-Weighted Short-Term - Adjusted Volume-Weighted Long-Term
├── Reversal Indicator
│   ├── -Momentum Factor
├── Smoothed Momentum Calculation
│   ├── Rolling Average of Volume-Adjusted Price Change (e.g., 10 days)
│   ├── Current Window Average - Previous Window Average
├── Momentum Trend
    ├── Moving Average of Momentum Factor (e.g., 20 days)
    ├── If Momentum Factor > Moving Average
    │   └── Strong Uptrend Signal
    ├── If Momentum Factor < Moving Average
    │   └── Strong Downtrend Signal
    └── Otherwise
        └── Sideways or Neutral Signal
├── Additional Factors
│   ├── Cumulative Volume
│   │   ├── Sum of volume from day (t-5) to day t
│   ├── Cumulative Price Change
│   │   ├── (High price of day t - Low price of day (t-5))
│   ├── Cumulative Volume-Adjusted Price Change
│   │   ├── (High price of day t - Low price of day (t-5)) * Cumulative Volume
│   ├── Rolling Average of Cumulative Volume-Adjusted Price Change (e.g., 10 days)
│   ├── Current Window Average - Previous Window Average
├── Combined Indicator
    ├── (Momentum Factor + Cumulative Volume-Adjusted Price Change) / 2
    ├── If Combined Indicator > 0
    │   └── Positive Signal
    ├── If Combined Indicator < 0
    │   └── Negative Signal
    └── Otherwise
        └── Neutral Signal
├── Moving Averages
│   ├── 5-Day Moving Average of Close Price
│   │   ├── Compute the average of Close prices from day t-4 to day t
│   ├── 60-Day Moving Average of Close Price
│   │   ├── Compute the average of Close prices from day t-59 to day t
