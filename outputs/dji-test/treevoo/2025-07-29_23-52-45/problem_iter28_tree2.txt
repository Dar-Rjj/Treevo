Explore Advanced Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume Data
- Utilize Open, High, Low, Close Prices
  - Calculate Intraday Volatility: (High - Low) / Close
  - Identify Price Reversal Patterns
    - Detect Bullish/Bearish Engulfing Patterns
      - Bullish: Today's close > Yesterday's open AND Today's open < Yesterday's close
      - Bearish: Today's close < Yesterday's open AND Today's open > Yesterday's close
    - Detect Doji Patterns
      - Open and Close are very close to each other
      - High and Low are significantly different from Open/Close
- Analyze Volume Data
  - Compute Changes in Trading Volume: (Volume(t) - Volume(t-1)) / Volume(t-1)
  - Examine Volume Spike Events
    - Flag as Spike if Volume(t) > k * Volume(t-1)
  - Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP): Sum(Price * Volume) / Sum(Volume)
- Combine Price and Volume Analysis
  - Create Composite Alpha Factors
    - Factor 1: Intraday Volatility * Volume Change
    - Factor 2: Presence of Price Reversal * Volume Change
    - Factor 3: Intraday Volatility * VWAP
- Evaluate Historical Performance
  - Backtest Generated Alpha Factors
    - Use Walk-Forward Analysis: Split Data into Training and Testing Periods
    - Implement Time Series Cross-Validation
  - Assess Predictive Power
    - Measure Correlation with Future Returns: Focus on Next Day
    - Calculate Sharpe Ratio for Portfolio
- Refine and Iterate
  - Adjust Parameters Based on Backtesting Results
  - Explore Additional Price and Volume-Based Features
  - Develop Custom Indicators
    - Example: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) with custom parameters
