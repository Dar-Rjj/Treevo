- Sub-thought: Calculate Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for different time periods
  - Sub-thought: Use close prices for SMA5, SMA10, and SMA20
  - Sub-thought: Subtract SMA5 from SMA10 and divide by SMA10
  - Sub-thought: Subtract SMA10 from SMA20 and divide by SMA20
- Sub-thought: Calculate Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) for different time periods
  - Sub-thought: Use close prices for WMA5, WMA10, and WMA20
  - Sub-thought: Subtract WMA5 from WMA10 and divide by WMA10
  - Sub-thought: Subtract WMA10 from WMA20 and divide by WMA20

Thought: Investigate Volatility and Its Impact on Future Returns
- Sub-thought: Calculate Average True Range (ATR) over a 14-day period
- Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between high and low prices for each day
  - Sub-thought: Take the average of these differences over the last 14 days
- Sub-thought: Divide the ATR by the close price

Thought: Analyze Volume-Based Indicators for Trading Activity
- Sub-thought: Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
  - Sub-thought: If close > previous close, add volume to OBV
  - Sub-thought: If close < previous close, subtract volume from OBV
- Sub-thought: Calculate Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) over a 20-day period
  - Sub-thought: Calculate money flow multiplier for each day
    - Sub-thought: (close - low) - (high - close) / (high - low)
  - Sub-thought: Multiply the money flow multiplier by the volume
  - Sub-thought: Sum the money flow volumes over the last 20 days
  - Sub-thought: Divide the sum by the total volume over the last 20 days

Thought: Examine Price and Volume Relationships
- Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of current volume to the 20-day moving average volume
- Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of current close price to the 20-day moving average price
- Sub-thought: Multiply the two ratios together

Thought: Investigate Candlestick Patterns for Short-Term Reversals
- Sub-thought: Identify bullish engulfing patterns
  - Sub-thought: Today's open < yesterday's close and today's close > yesterday's open
- Sub-thought: Identify bearish engulfing patterns
  - Sub-thought: Today's open > yesterday's close and today's close < yesterday's open
- Sub-thought: Assign a score based on the presence of these patterns
  - Sub-thought: +1 for bullish engulfing, -1 for bearish engulfing, 0 otherwise
