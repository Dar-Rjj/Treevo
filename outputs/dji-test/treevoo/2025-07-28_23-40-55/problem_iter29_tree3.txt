Thought: Integrate multiple factors to predict future stock returns by synthesizing components from OHLC, amount, and volume data.

- Sub-thought: Calculate intraday volatility and momentum measures
  - Sub-thought: Daily price range (high - low)
  - Sub-thought: Intraday true range (max(high - close, high - open, close - open))
  - Sub-thought: 1-day return (close price of day t - close price of day t-1) / close price of day t-1
  - Sub-thought: 5-day return (close price of day t - close price of day t-5) / close price of day t-5
  - Sub-thought: 20-day return (close price of day t - close price of day t-20) / close price of day t-20
  - Sub-thought: 60-day return (close price of day t - close price of day t-60) / close price of day t-60
  - Sub-thought: Standard deviation of daily returns over a 20-day period
  - Sub-thought: Momentum in close price over 10 days

- Sub-thought: Analyze trading activity and volume
  - Sub-thought: Volume relative to 20-day moving average
  - Sub-thought: Volume spikes as a percentage increase over the previous day
  - Sub-thought: 5-day average trading volume
  - Sub-thought: 20-day average trading volume

- Sub-thought: Construct indicators based on price movements and support/resistance levels
  - Sub-thought: Close minus open (C-O), indicating the direction of daily price movement
  - Sub-thought: Close minus low (C-L) divided by (high - low), indicating where the closing price is relative to the daily range
  - Sub-thought: Number of days where the close price is above the 20-day moving average
  - Sub-thought: Number of days where the close price is below the 20-day moving average

- Sub-thought: Incorporate amount traded
  - Sub-thought: Amount traded per share (Amount / Volume)
  - Sub-thought: Ratio of amount traded to the closing price (Amount / Close)

- Sub-thought: Leverage historical returns and trend indicators
  - Sub-thought: 5-day simple return
  - Sub-thought: 20-day simple return
  - Sub-thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover, using 50-day and 200-day SMA
  - Sub-thought: Directional Movement Index (DMI) to measure the strength of the trend

- Sub-thought: Investigate accumulation/distribution and technical patterns
  - Sub-thought: Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line) using high, low, and close
  - Sub-thought: A/D Oscillator, derived from A/D Line
  - Sub-thought: Doji pattern (open ≈ close with notable high-low spread)
  - Sub-thought: Hammer pattern (closing significantly higher than open, with a long lower shadow)

- Sub-thought: Evaluate intraday sentiment
  - Sub-thought: Proportion of up days (days where close > open) over a 20-day period
  - Sub-thought: Proportion of down days (days where close < open) over a 20-day period
