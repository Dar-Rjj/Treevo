Thought: Develop novel alpha factors from OHLC, amount, and volume data for predicting future stock returns

- Sub-thought: Calculate intraday volatility measures
  - Sub-thought: Daily price range (high - low)
  - Sub-thought: Intraday true range (max(high - close, high - open, close - open))
- Sub-thought: Analyze trading activity through volume
  - Sub-thought: Volume relative to 20-day moving average
  - Sub-thought: Volume spikes as a percentage increase over the previous day
- Sub-thought: Construct indicators based on price movements
  - Sub-thought: Close minus open (C-O), indicating the direction of daily price movement
  - Sub-thought: Close minus low (C-L) divided by (high - low), indicating where the closing price is relative to the daily range
- Sub-thought: Incorporate amount traded
  - Sub-thought: Amount traded per share (Amount / Volume)
  - Sub-thought: Ratio of amount traded to the closing price (Amount / Close)
- Sub-thought: Explore momentum in price and volume
  - Sub-thought: Momentum in close price over 10 days
  - Sub-thought: Momentum in volume over 10 days
- Sub-thought: Utilize technical patterns
  - Sub-thought: Doji pattern (open ≈ close with notable high-low spread)
  - Sub-thought: Hammer pattern (closing significantly higher than open, with a long lower shadow)
- Sub-thought: Leverage historical returns
  - Sub-thought: 5-day simple return
  - Sub-thought: 20-day simple return
- Sub-thought: Integrate trend indicators
  - Sub-thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover, using 50-day and 200-day SMA
  - Sub-thought: Directional Movement Index (DMI) to measure the strength of the trend
- Sub-thought: Investigate accumulation/distribution
  - Sub-thought: Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line) using high, low, and close
  - Sub-thought: A/D Oscillator, derived from A/D Line
