Thought: Alpha Factor Generation from OHLCV Data
- Sub-thought: Momentum-based Factors
  - Sub-thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between a short-term EMA and a long-term EMA
  - Sub-thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the RSI based on the average gains and losses over a specified period
- Sub-thought: Volume-related Factors
  - Sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate OBV by summing volume on up days and subtracting volume on down days
  - Sub-thought: Volume Price Trend (VPT)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate VPT as the cumulative sum of (close - previous close) / previous close * volume
- Sub-thought: Volatility-based Factors
  - Sub-thought: True Range
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the true range as the max of (high - low), abs(high - previous close), and abs(low - previous close)
  - Sub-thought: Average True Range (ATR)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the exponential moving average of the true range over a certain period
- Sub-thought: Trend-following Factors
  - Sub-thought: Directional Movement Index (DMI)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate +DI and -DI based on upward and downward price movements, then find the difference between +DI and -DI
  - Sub-thought: Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in the close price over a specified period
- Sub-thought: Breakout-related Factors
  - Sub-thought: Donchian Channels
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the highest high and lowest low over a certain period to form a channel
  - Sub-thought: Keltner Channels
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the EMA of the typical price (average of high, low, and close)
    - Sub-thought: Create upper and lower bands at a certain multiple of the ATR from the EMA
- Sub-thought: Price Pattern Factors
  - Sub-thought: Price Momentum
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the current close and the close n periods ago
  - Sub-thought: Price Change Ratio
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of the current close to the close n periods ago
- Sub-thought: Combined Factors
  - Sub-thought: Integration of Multiple Indicators
    - Sub-thought: Combine momentum, volume, and trend factors using a weighted sum or other composite method
  - Sub-thought: Custom Composite Factor
    - Sub-thought: Create a custom composite factor by combining EMA crossover, OBV, and ROC
