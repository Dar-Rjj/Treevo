Thought: Explore price patterns and trading volume to generate alpha factors

  Sub-thought: Calculate trend indicators based on price
    Sub-thought: Calculate simple moving averages (SMA) for close prices
      Sub-thought: Calculate SMA for a short period (e.g., 5 days)
      Sub-thought: Calculate SMA for a long period (e.g., 20 days)
    Sub-thought: Determine if the short-term SMA is above or below the long-term SMA
      Sub-thought: Create a binary signal (1 if short-term SMA > long-term SMA, -1 otherwise)

  Sub-thought: Analyze price momentum
    Sub-thought: Calculate rate of change (ROC) between close prices
      Sub-thought: Calculate ROC over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
    Sub-thought: Calculate relative strength index (RSI)
      Sub-thought: Compute RSI using the 14-day period

  Sub-thought: Investigate trading volume
    Sub-thought: Calculate average volume over different periods
      Sub-thought: Calculate average volume over a short period (e.g., 5 days)
      Sub-thought: Calculate average volume over a long period (e.g., 20 days)
    Sub-thought: Determine if the current day's volume is significantly higher or lower than the average
      Sub-thought: Create a binary signal (1 if current volume > average volume, -1 otherwise)

  Sub-thought: Combine multiple factors
    Sub-thought: Integrate the SMA crossover signal with the ROC and RSI
      Sub-thought: Assign a weighted score to each factor
      Sub-thought: Sum the weighted scores to create a composite alpha factor
    Sub-thought: Integrate the volume signal
      Sub-thought: Assign a weighted score to the volume signal
      Sub-thought: Sum the weighted scores to include the volume factor in the composite alpha factor
