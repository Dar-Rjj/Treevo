Improved Intraday Momentum and Trend Analysis with Volume Filters

├── Calculate Enhanced Intraday Momentum
│   ├── Compute High-Low Difference (High - Low)
│   ├── Compute Open-Close Return (Close / Open - 1)
│   └── Weighted Average of High-Low Difference and Open-Close Return
│       ├── Assign Weight to High-Low Difference
│       └── Assign Weight to Open-Close Return
│   └── Apply Non-Linear Transformation (e.g., x^2)

├── Analyze Price Trends and Momentum
│   ├── Calculate Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for Close Prices
│   │   ├── Calculate SMA for a Short Period (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   └── Calculate SMA for a Long Period (e.g., 20 days)
│   └── Determine if the Short-Term SMA is Above or Below the Long-Term SMA
│       └── Create a Binary Signal (1 if short-term SMA > long-term SMA, -1 otherwise)
│   ├── Calculate Rate of Change (ROC) between Close Prices
│   │   └── Calculate ROC over a Short Period (e.g., 5 days)
│   └── Calculate Relative Strength Index (RSI)
│       └── Compute RSI using the 14-day Period

├── Apply Integrated Volume and Amount Shock Filter
│   ├── Compute Volume Ratio (Current Volume / Previous Day Volume)
│   ├── Compute Amount Ratio (Current Amount / Previous Day Amount)
│   └── Include if (Volume Ratio > 1.5) AND (Amount Ratio > 1.5)

├── Measure Synchronized Volume and Price Changes
│   ├── Volume Change (Current Volume - Previous Day's Volume)
│   ├── Price Change (Close - Previous Day's Close)
│   └── Synchronize Changes (Sign of (Volume Change * Price Change))

├── Investigate Trading Volume
│   ├── Calculate Average Volume over Different Periods
│   │   ├── Calculate Average Volume over a Short Period (e.g., 5 days)
│   │   └── Calculate Average Volume over a Long Period (e.g., 20 days)
│   └── Determine if the Current Day's Volume is Significantly Higher or Lower than the Average
│       └── Create a Binary Signal (1 if current volume > average volume, -1 otherwise)

└── Combine Multiple Factors
    ├── Integrate the SMA Crossover Signal with the ROC and RSI
    │   ├── Assign a Weighted Score to Each Factor
    │   └── Sum the Weighted Scores to Create a Composite Alpha Factor
    └── Integrate the Volume and Synchronized Volume Signals
        ├── Assign a Weighted Score to the Volume Signal
        ├── Assign a Weighted Score to the Synchronized Volume Signal
        └── Sum the Weighted Scores to Include the Volume and Synchronized Volume Factors in the Composite Alpha Factor
