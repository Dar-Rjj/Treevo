Generate alpha factors using historical price and volume data
- Calculate moving averages to identify trends
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices over n days
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of closing prices with a smoothing factor
- Analyze volatility using high, low, and close prices
  - True Range (TR) as the greatest of: high - low, abs(high - previous close), abs(low - previous close)
  - Average True Range (ATR) over n days
- Use price and volume momentum indicators
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI) based on average gains and losses over n days
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV) by summing daily volume based on price change
- Implement trend following strategies
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) with two EMAs and a signal line
  - Price Crossover: current close crossing above/below a chosen moving average
- Consider accumulation/distribution patterns
  - Chaikin Oscillator: difference between 3-day EMA and 10-day EMA of Accumulation/Distribution Line
  - Money Flow Index (MFI) as a volume-weighted RSI
- Evaluate price action
  - Inside Bar: current day's high is lower than the previous day's high, and its low is higher than the previous day's low
  - Outside Bar: current day's high is higher than the previous day's high, and its low is lower than the previous day's low
- Incorporate volume analysis
  - Volume Ratio: current day's volume divided by the average volume over n days
  - Volume Price Trend (VPT): cumulative product of (current close - previous close) / previous close * current volume
- Create combined factors
  - Factor 1: SMA(n) + ATR(n) + OBV
  - Factor 2: RSI(n) + MACD + MFI
  - Factor 3: Inside Bar + Outside Bar + VPT
- Test and validate factors
  - Perform backtesting on historical data
  - Assess performance and statistical significance
  - Adjust parameters and re-test
