Improved Intraday Momentum and Volume Dynamics Integration with Shock Filters
├── Calculate Enhanced Intraday Momentum
│   ├── Compute High-Low Difference (High - Low)
│   ├── Compute Open-Close Return (Close / Open - 1)
│   └── Weighted Average of High-Low Difference and Open-Close Return
│       ├── Assign Weight to High-Low Difference
│       └── Assign Weight to Open-Close Return
│   └── Apply Non-Linear Transformation (e.g., x^2)
├── Apply Integrated Volume and Amount Shock Filter
│   ├── Determine Volume Change (Current Volume - Previous Day Volume)
│   ├── Compute Volume Ratio (Current Volume / Previous Day Volume)
│   ├── Determine Amount Change (Current Amount - Previous Day Amount)
│   ├── Compute Amount Ratio (Current Amount / Previous Day Amount)
│   ├── Threshold Filter
│   │   ├── Include if (Volume Ratio > 1.5) AND (Amount Ratio > 1.5)
└── Measure Synchronized Volume and Price Changes
    ├── Volume Change (Current Volume - Previous Day's Volume)
    ├── Price Change (Close - Previous Day's Close)
    ├── Apply Volume Shock Filter (Include if Volume Ratio > 1.5)
    └── Synchronize Changes (Sign of (Volume Change * Price Change))
├── Combine Enhanced Intraday Momentum, Synchronized Volume, and OBV-Momentum Factor
    ├── Final Alpha Factor = (Enhanced Intraday Momentum + Synchronized Volume Product + Momentum and OBV Factor)
