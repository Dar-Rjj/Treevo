Volume and Momentum Enhanced Alpha Factor with Additional Price Dynamics
├── Calculate Intraday Price Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High to get Range
├── Adjust for Volume
│   ├── Divide Volume by Mean of last 10 days Volume
│   └── Add 1 to avoid division by zero
├── Combine Intraday Range and Volume Adjustment
│   ├── Multiply Intraday Range by Volume Adjustment
├── Smoothing
│   ├── Apply Simple Moving Average (SMA) with Span of 5
│       └── On the combined Intraday Range and Volume Adjustment
├── Calculate MACD
│   ├── Short-term EMA of Close Price (last 12 days)
│   └── Long-term EMA of Close Price (last 26 days)
│   ├── MACD Line = Short-term EMA - Long-term EMA
│   └── Signal Line = 9-day EMA of MACD Line
├── Determine Momentum
│   ├── If MACD Line > Signal Line, mark as Bullish
│   └── If MACD Line < Signal Line, mark as Bearish
├── Calculate OBV
│   ├── If Close > Previous Close, increment OBV by Volume
│   ├── If Close < Previous Close, decrement OBV by Volume
│   └── If Close = Previous Close, leave OBV unchanged
├── Weight OBV by |MACD Line - Signal Line|
├── Calculate Price Velocity
│   ├── Calculate the Difference between Current Close and Close 10 Days Ago
│   ├── Divide by 10 to get the Daily Price Velocity
├── Final Alpha Factor
    └── Final Alpha Factor = Smoothed Intraday Momentum * OBV * Weight * Price Velocity
