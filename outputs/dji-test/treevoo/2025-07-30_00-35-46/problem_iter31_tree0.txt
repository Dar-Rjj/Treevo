Thought: Analyze price and volume data to uncover trends and patterns that may predict future stock returns.
  Thought: Calculate the relationship between closing price and volume to identify potential buying or selling pressure.
    Thought: Develop a factor based on the ratio of closing price to volume, indicating price per unit volume (PPUV).
      Thought: Enhance PPUV by incorporating the daily price range to capture intra-day volatility.
        Thought: Calculate a modified PPUV (mPPUV) as (close - open) / (high - low) * (close / volume).
  Thought: Examine the change in close prices over time to detect momentum.
    Thought: Calculate the difference between the current close and the previous day's close, then divide by the average of these two closes to create a momentum indicator.
      Thought: Improve the momentum indicator by extending it to a multi-period relative strength measure.
        Thought: Compute a n-day relative strength (RS) factor as the sum of positive changes divided by the absolute value of the sum of negative changes over the last n days.
  Thought: Investigate the relationship between high and low prices to determine the direction and magnitude of market sentiment.
    Thought: Generate a factor from the ratio of high to low prices, adjusted by the closing price.
      Thought: Formulate an adjusted high-low ratio (AHLR) as (high - low) / close.
        Thought: Augment AHLR with a trailing average to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
          Thought: Create a smoothed AHLR (sAHLR) by averaging the AHLR over the past m days.
  Thought: Assess the consistency of trading volumes to infer investor interest and market health.
    Thought: Measure the consistency of volumes by calculating the standard deviation of the last n days' volumes.
      Thought: Derive a stability factor as the inverse of the volume standard deviation, higher values indicating more consistent trading volume.
  Thought: Calculate Enhanced Intraday Momentum
    Thought: Compute High-Low Difference (High - Low)
    Thought: Compute Open-Close Return (Close / Open - 1)
    Thought: Weighted Average based on Volatility
      Thought: Compute Daily Volatility (High, Low, Close)
      Thought: Assign Higher Weight to More Volatile Days
    Thought: Apply Non-Linear Transformation (e.g., x^2)
  Thought: Apply Integrated Volume and Amount Shock Filter
    Thought: Determine Volume Ratio (Current Volume / Previous Day Volume)
    Thought: Determine Amount Ratio (Current Amount / Previous Day Amount)
    Thought: Determine Price Shock
      Thought: Absolute Price Change (|Close - Previous Close|)
      Thought: Price Shock Ratio (Absolute Price Change / Historical Price Range)
    Thought: Threshold Filter
      Thought: Include Intraday Momentum if (Volume Ratio > 1.5) AND (Amount Ratio > 1.5) AND (Price Shock Ratio > 0.05)
  Thought: Measure Synchronized Volume and Price Changes
    Thought: Volume Change (Current Volume - Previous Day's Volume)
    Thought: Price Change (Close - Previous Day's Close)
    Thought: Apply Volume Shock Filter (Volume Ratio > 1.5)
    Thought: Synchronize Changes
      Thought: Sign of (Volume Change * Price Change)
  Thought: Adjust for Volume
    Thought: Divide Combined Metric by Current Volume
  Thought: Calculate EMAs and Determine Momentum
    Thought: Short EMA (5 days)
    Thought: Long EMA (20 days)
    Thought: Categorize as Bullish or Bearish
      Thought: If Short EMA > Long EMA, mark as Bullish; else, Bearish
  Thought: Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    Thought: Increment OBV by Volume if Close > Previous Close
    Thought: Decrement OBV by Volume if Close < Previous Close
    Thought: Leave OBV unchanged if Close = Previous Close
  Thought: Combine Momentum and OBV into a Factor
    Thought: Weight = |Short EMA - Long EMA|
    Thought: OBV-Momentum Factor = OBV * Weight
  Thought: Synthesize Final Alpha Factor
    Thought: Add Volume-Adjusted Intraday Metric, Synchronized Value, and OBV-Momentum Factor
  Thought: Integrate Volume-Weighted Intraday Momentum with OBV Factor
    Thought: Multiply Smoothed Intraday Momentum by OBV Factor
    Thought: Final Alpha Factor = Smoothed Intraday Momentum * OBV Factor
