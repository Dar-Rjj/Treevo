Calculate Intraday Price Range and Adjust for Volume
├── Subtract Low from High to get Range
├── Adjust for Volume
│   ├── Divide Volume by Mean of last 5 days Volume
│   └── Add 0.01 to avoid division by zero
├── Multiply Intraday Range by Volume Adjustment
Smoothing
├── Apply Simple Moving Average (SMA) with Span of 5
│   └── On the combined Intraday Range and Volume Adjustment
Calculate SMA Cross Signal
├── SMA of Close Price over Short Period (last 5 days)
└── SMA of Close Price over Long Period (last 20 days)
Determine Momentum
├── Compare Short and Long SMA
│   ├── If Short SMA > Long SMA, mark as Bullish
│   └── If Short SMA < Long SMA, mark as Bearish
Calculate Intraday Momentum
├── Compute High-Low Difference (High - Low)
├── Compute Open-Close Return (Close - Open)
└── Combine High-Low and Open-Close Returns
    ├── Weighted Average of High-Low Difference and Open-Close Return
Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
├── Initialize OBV to 0
├── If Close > Previous Close, increment OBV by Volume
├── If Close < Previous Close, decrement OBV by Volume
└── If Close = Previous Close, leave OBV unchanged
Weight OBV by Difference between Short and Long SMA
└── Final OBV Factor = OBV * |Short SMA - Long SMA|
Apply Volume and Amount Shock Filter
├── Compute Volume Ratio (Current Volume / Previous Day Volume)
├── Compute Amount Ratio (Current Amount / Previous Day Amount)
└── Threshold Filter
    └── Include Intraday Momentum if (Volume Ratio > 1.5) AND (Amount Ratio > 1.5)
Measure Volume Synchronization
├── Compute Volume Change (Volume - Previous Day's Volume)
├── Compute Price Change (Close - Previous Day's Close)
└── Sign of the Synchronized Product
Synthesize Combined Factor
├── Add Volume-Adjusted Intraday Metric
├── Add Synchronization Value
└── Ensure Positive Values
Final Alpha Factor
└── Final Alpha Factor = Smoothed Intraday Momentum * Final OBV Factor (if combined shock filter is met)
