Thought: Alpha Factor Generation from OHLCV Data
- Sub-thought: Momentum-based Factors
  - Sub-thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between a short-term SMA and a long-term SMA
- Sub-thought: Volume-related Factors
  - Sub-thought: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate VWAP as the cumulative sum of (close * volume) divided by the cumulative sum of volume
  - Sub-thought: Volume Oscillator
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of the short-term moving average of volume to the long-term moving average of volume
- Sub-thought: Volatility-based Factors
  - Sub-thought: True Range
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the true range as the max of (high - low), abs(high - previous close), and abs(low - previous close)
  - Sub-thought: Average True Range (ATR)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average of the true range over a certain period
- Sub-thought: Trend-following Factors
  - Sub-thought: Directional Movement Index (DMI)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate +DI and -DI based on upward and downward price movements, then find the difference between +DI and -DI
  - Sub-thought: Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the typical price as the average of high, low, and close
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the mean deviation of the typical price
    - Sub-thought: Use the mean deviation to measure the difference between the typical price and its simple moving average
- Sub-thought: Breakout-related Factors
  - Sub-thought: Donchian Channels
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the highest high and lowest low over a certain period to form a channel
  - Sub-thought: Bollinger Bands
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average of the close price
    - Sub-thought: Create upper and lower bands at a certain number of standard deviations from the SMA
- Sub-thought: Price Pattern Factors
  - Sub-thought: Price Momentum
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the current close and the close n periods ago
  - Sub-thought: Price Change Ratio
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of the current close to the close n periods ago
- Sub-thought: Combined Factors
  - Sub-thought: Integration of Multiple Indicators
    - Sub-thought: Combine momentum, volume, and trend factors using a weighted sum or other composite method
