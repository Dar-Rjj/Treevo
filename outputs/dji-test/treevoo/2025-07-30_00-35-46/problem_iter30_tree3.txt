Thought: Develop a factor based on the relationship between trading volume and price changes.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the daily return using (close - open) / open
  - Sub-thought: Multiply the daily return by the trading volume
    - Sub-thought: Sum the multiplied values over the past N days to create a momentum-like factor
- Sub-thought: Calculate the average daily return over the past M days
  - Sub-thought: Subtract the average daily return from the daily return to get a deviation
    - Sub-thought: Multiply the deviation by the trading volume
      - Sub-thought: Sum the multiplied deviations over the past N days to create a volatility-adjusted factor
Thought: Analyze the high-low range and its impact on future returns.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the daily high-low range as (high - low)
  - Sub-thought: Divide the high-low range by the open price to normalize the range
    - Sub-thought: Smooth the normalized high-low range using a simple moving average over the past P days
      - Sub-thought: Use the smoothed high-low range as a measure of recent volatility
- Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the close and the average of the high and low
  - Sub-thought: Smooth this difference using a simple moving average over the past Q days
    - Sub-thought: Use the smoothed difference as a trend-following indicator
Thought: Create a factor based on the relationship between price and volume changes.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in trading volume compared to the previous day
  - Sub-thought: Combine the percentage change in trading volume with the daily return
    - Sub-thought: Create a combined factor by multiplying the percentage change in volume by the daily return
- Sub-thought: Identify days where the trading volume is significantly higher or lower than the average volume over the past R days
  - Sub-thought: On high-volume days, calculate the excess return by subtracting the average return
    - Sub-thought: On low-volume days, calculate the deficit return by subtracting the average return
      - Sub-thought: Sum the excess and deficit returns over the past S days to create a volume-sensitivity factor
