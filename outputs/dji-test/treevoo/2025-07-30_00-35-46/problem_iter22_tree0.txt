- Use raw (open, high, low, close) prices, amount, and volume data to construct interpretable factors
  - Calculate simple moving averages to capture trends
    - Define SMA_close for different time windows
      - SMA_close_5: 5-day Simple Moving Average of close prices
      - SMA_close_20: 20-day Simple Moving Average of close prices
  - Utilize price difference to measure momentum
    - Difference between current close and previous close prices
      - Price_change = Close_t - Close_t-1
  - Evaluate volatility using standard deviation
    - Daily return calculation
      - Daily_return = (Close_t - Open_t) / Open_t * 100
    - Standard deviation of daily returns over different periods
      - Volatility_5: 5-day standard deviation of daily returns
      - Volatility_20: 20-day standard deviation of daily returns
  - Analyze trading volume for liquidity and activity
    - Volume ratio compared to a moving average
      - Volume_ratio = Volume_t / SMA_volume_5
  - Investigate the relationship between high, low, and closing prices
    - True range as a measure of volatility
      - True_range = max(High_t - Low_t, abs(High_t - Close_t-1), abs(Low_t - Close_t-1))
    - Directional movement indicators
      - Positive_directional_movement = High_t - High_t-1
      - Negative_directional_movement = Low_t-1 - Low_t
  - Measure market sentiment with candlestick patterns
    - Bullish engulfing pattern: Previous day's close < previous day's open AND today's close > today's open AND today's close > previous day's open AND today's open < previous day's close
    - Bearish engulfing pattern: Previous day's close > previous day's open AND today's close < today's open AND today's close < previous day's open AND today's open > previous day's close
