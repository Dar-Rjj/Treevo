Thought: Combined Intraday Momentum and Volume-Enhanced Factors for Alpha Generation
- Sub-thought: Calculate Base Intraday Return
  - (Close - Open) / Open
- Sub-thought: Compute High-Low Momentum Component
  - (High - Low) / Open
- Sub-thought: Average Intraday and High-Low Momentum
  - (Base Intraday Return + High-Low Momentum Component) / 2
- Sub-thought: Adjust for Volume and Amount Impact
  - Volume Ratio
    - Current Volume / Previous Volume
  - Amount Ratio
    - Current Amount / Previous Amount
  - Adjusted Momentum
    - Average Intraday and High-Low Momentum * (Volume Ratio * Amount Ratio)
- Sub-thought: Apply Volume Shock Filter
  - If Volume Ratio > 1.5, then use the Adjusted Momentum
- Sub-thought: Smooth the Adjusted Momentum
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with Span of 5
- Sub-thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV) Calculation
  - Initialize OBV to 0
  - If Close > Previous Close, increment OBV by Volume
  - If Close < Previous Close, decrement OBV by Volume
  - If Close = Previous Close, leave OBV unchanged
- Sub-thought: Weight OBV by MACD Line and Signal Line Difference
  - Weight = |MACD Line - Signal Line|
- Sub-thought: Final OBV Factor
  - OBV * Weight
- Sub-thought: Final Alpha Factor
  - Smoothed Adjusted Momentum * Final OBV Factor
- Sub-thought: Integration of Additional Trend and Volatility Indicators
  - True Range
    - Max(High - Low, abs(High - Previous Close), abs(Low - Previous Close))
  - Average True Range (ATR)
    - EMA of True Range over a certain period
  - Directional Movement Index (DMI)
    - Calculate +DI and -DI based on upward and downward price movements
    - Difference between +DI and -DI
- Sub-thought: Combined Alpha Factor
  - Combine the Final Alpha Factor with ATR and DMI using a weighted sum or other composite method
