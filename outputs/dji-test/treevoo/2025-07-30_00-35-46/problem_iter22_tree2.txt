Thought: Analyze price and volume data to uncover trends and patterns that may predict future stock returns.
  Thought: Calculate the relationship between closing price and volume to identify potential buying or selling pressure.
    Thought: Develop a factor based on the ratio of closing price to volume, indicating price per unit volume (PPUV).
      Thought: Enhance PPUV by incorporating the daily price range to capture intra-day volatility.
        Thought: Calculate a modified PPUV (mPPUV) as (close - open) / (high - low) * (close / volume).
  Thought: Examine the change in close prices over time to detect momentum.
    Thought: Calculate the difference between the current close and the previous day's close, then divide by the average of these two closes to create a momentum indicator.
      Thought: Improve the momentum indicator by extending it to a multi-period relative strength measure.
        Thought: Compute a n-day relative strength (RS) factor as the sum of positive changes divided by the absolute value of the sum of negative changes over the last n days.
  Thought: Investigate the relationship between high and low prices to determine the direction and magnitude of market sentiment.
    Thought: Generate a factor from the ratio of high to low prices, adjusted by the closing price.
      Thought: Formulate an adjusted high-low ratio (AHLR) as (high - low) / close.
        Thought: Augment AHLR with a trailing average to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
          Thought: Create a smoothed AHLR (sAHLR) by averaging the AHLR over the past m days.
  Thought: Assess the consistency of trading volumes to infer investor interest and market health.
    Thought: Measure the consistency of volumes by calculating the standard deviation of the last n days' volumes.
      Thought: Derive a stability factor as the inverse of the volume standard deviation, higher values indicating more consistent trading volume.
