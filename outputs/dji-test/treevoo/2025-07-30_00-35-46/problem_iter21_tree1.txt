Thought: Create a Momentum Indicator Using Price and Volume Data
- Sub-thought: Calculate Close Price Change Over Period
  - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between the close price of day t and the close price of day (t-n)
  - Sub-thought: Sum the differences over the last m periods to get cumulative price change
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
  - Sub-thought: For each period, multiply the close price by the volume
  - Sub-thought: Sum the product of close price and volume over the last n periods
  - Sub-thought: Sum the volume over the last n periods
  - Sub-thought: Divide the sum of the product by the sum of the volume to get VWAP
- Sub-thought: Combine Momentum and VWAP
  - Sub-thought: Subtract the VWAP at day (t-n) from the VWAP at day t
  - Sub-thought: Multiply the result by the cumulative price change
- Sub-thought: Determine the Significance of Price Movement
  - Sub-thought: If the combined value is positive, assign a higher alpha factor
  - Sub-thought: If the combined value is negative, assign a lower alpha factor
- Sub-thought: Use Low and High Prices to Measure Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the average range (high - low) over the last n periods
  - Sub-thought: Compare the current period's range with the average range
  - Sub-thought: If the current range is greater, increase the alpha factor
  - Sub-thought: If the current range is less, decrease the alpha factor
- Sub-thought: Incorporate Trading Volume Trends
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the average volume over the last n periods
  - Sub-thought: If the current volume is above the average, increase the alpha factor
  - Sub-thought: If the current volume is below the average, decrease the alpha factor
- Sub-thought: Final Alpha Factor Calculation
  - Sub-thought: Sum the adjusted values from the combined momentum, VWAP, price movement significance, volatility, and trading volume trends
  - Sub-thought: Use the final sum as the alpha factor for day t
