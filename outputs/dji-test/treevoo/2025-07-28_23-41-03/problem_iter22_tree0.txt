Thought: Explore price patterns and volume interactions for alpha factor generation
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze the relationship between closing price and daily range
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of close to high (C/H) as a measure of day's performance
      - Sub-Thought: Examine historical C/H ratios to identify trends or patterns that correlate with future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Investigate the impact of volume on price movements
    - Sub-Thought: Compute a VWAP-like metric by adjusting the price difference (high - low) by volume
      - Sub-Thought: Use this metric to assess market sentiment and predict short-term reversals or continuations
  - Sub-Thought: Utilize opening price in conjunction with other data points
    - Sub-Thought: Measure the gap between opening and closing prices (O-C) to gauge market momentum
      - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the significance of O-C gaps over multiple days on future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Explore indicators based on price and volume changes
    - Sub-Thought: Develop a simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
      - Sub-Thought: Compare current close to SMA to identify deviations indicative of mean reversion or trend continuation
    - Sub-Thought: Construct a volume-weighted moving average (VWMA) of close prices
      - Sub-Thought: Assess the relationship between VWMA and recent price action for predictive power
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate multiple factors to create a composite alpha factor
    - Sub-Thought: Combine C/H ratio, VWAP-like metric, and O-C gap into a single factor
      - Sub-Thought: Weigh each component based on historical predictive power and evaluate its performance
    - Sub-Thought: Incorporate SMA and VWMA crossovers with support and resistance levels
      - Sub-Thought: Create a composite signal that considers both price and volume dynamics for generating alpha
