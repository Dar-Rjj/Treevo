Thought: Synthesize Advanced Momentum and Volume-Weighted Price Movement Factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Determine the difference between the 10-day SMA and 20-day SMA
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) using (High + Low + Close) / 3 * Volume
- Sub-thought: Compute the 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWAP
- Sub-thought: Compute the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWAP
- Sub-thought: Determine the ratio of the 10-day EMA to the 50-day EMA
- Sub-thought: Introduce a 5-day Rate of Change (ROC) of Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Combine the momentum factor (difference between 10-day and 20-day SMA), the VWAP ratio, and the 5-day ROC
- Sub-thought: Use the combined factor, where positive values, ratios above 1, and high ROC indicate bullish momentum and strong price movement

Thought: Integrate Volatility and Relative Strength Index (RSI) with Additional Momentum
- Sub-thought: Calculate the average True Range (ATR) using the formula ATR = (High - Low)
- Sub-thought: Compute the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of ATR
- Sub-thought: Use the 14-day SMA of ATR as a measure of volatility
- Sub-thought: Higher ATR values indicate higher volatility, which can be used to predict future returns
- Sub-thought: Calculate the daily price change using Close(t) - Close(t-1)
- Sub-thought: Separate the gains and losses from the daily price changes
- Sub-thought: Compute the 14-day average gain and 14-day average loss
- Sub-thought: Calculate the RSI using the formula: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (average gain / average loss)))
- Sub-thought: Use the RSI as a factor, where values above 70 indicate overbought conditions and below 30 indicate oversold conditions
- Sub-thought: Introduce a 20-day Momentum factor using the difference between the current close and the 20-day SMA of Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Combine the volatility factor (14-day SMA of ATR), the RSI, and the 20-day Momentum
- Sub-thought: Use the combined factor, where high ATR values, RSI above 70 or below 30, and significant 20-day Momentum indicate potential market turning points

Thought: Merge Money Flow Index (MFI) and Volume-Weighted Price Movement with On-Balance Volume (OBV)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Typical Price (TP) using (High + Low + Close) / 3
- Sub-thought: Compute the Money Flow (MF) by multiplying TP by Volume
- Sub-thought: Determine the Positive Money Flow (PMF) and Negative Money Flow (NMF) based on whether TP is greater or less than the previous day's TP
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 14-day positive money flow and 14-day negative money flow
- Sub-thought: Compute the Money Ratio (MR) using 14-day PMF / 14-day NMF
- Sub-thought: Calculate the MFI using the formula: MFI = 100 - (100 / (1 + MR))
- Sub-thought: Use the MFI as a factor, where values above 80 indicate overbought conditions and below 20 indicate oversold conditions
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) using (High + Low + Close) / 3 * Volume
- Sub-thought: Compute the 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWAP
- Sub-thought: Compute the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWAP
- Sub-thought: Determine the ratio of the 10-day EMA to the 50-day EMA
- Sub-thought: Introduce On-Balance Volume (OBV) by accumulating volume on up days and subtracting on down days
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 10-day EMA of OBV
- Sub-thought: Combine the MFI, the VWAP ratio, and the 10-day EMA of OBV
- Sub-thought: Use the combined factor, where MFI values above 80 or below 2
