- Calculate daily return
  - Define daily return as (Close_t - Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}
- Analyze price patterns
  - Calculate daily range as (High - Low)
  - Compute high-low ratio as (Close - Low) / (High - Low)
- Measure price momentum
  - Calculate the 5-day moving average of daily returns
  - Calculate the 20-day moving average of daily returns
- Evaluate volume trends
  - Calculate the 5-day moving average of volume
  - Calculate the 20-day moving average of volume
  - Compute the ratio of 5-day to 20-day volume moving average
- Assess trading activity
  - Calculate the 5-day and 20-day moving average of amount
  - Compute the ratio of 5-day to 20-day amount moving average
- Combine indicators
  - Create a composite factor by summing the 5-day and 20-day moving averages of returns, volume, and amount
  - Weight the composite factor by the high-low ratio
- Evaluate recent performance
  - Calculate the 5-day cumulative return

  - Calculate the RSI (Relative Strength Index) over 14 days
  - Determine if the RSI is above 70 or below 30
- Detect trend continuation
  - Calculate the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) line as 12-day EMA minus 26-day EMA
  - Calculate the 9-day EMA of the MACD line (Signal Line)
  - Determine if the MACD line crosses above or below the Signal Line
- Evaluate market sentiment
  - Calculate the 5-day change in the 5-day moving average of volume
  - Determine if the 5-day change in volume is increasing or decreasing
- Finalize alpha factor
  - Combine the weighted composite factor with the RSI and MACD signals
  - Use the final combined factor to predict future stock returns
