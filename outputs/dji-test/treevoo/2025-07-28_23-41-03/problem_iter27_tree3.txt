Thought: Begin by exploring price-based factors
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily return
        Sub-Thought: Use the close prices to calculate daily returns (close[t] / close[t-1] - 1)
    Sub-Thought: Investigate the concept of price momentum
        Sub-Thought: Compute a short-term moving average (e.g., 5-day MA) of closing prices
            Sub-Thought: Subtract the 5-day MA from the close price to observe short-term deviations
        Sub-Thought: Compute a long-term moving average (e.g., 20-day MA) of closing prices
            Sub-Thought: Subtract the 20-day MA from the close price to observe long-term deviations
    Sub-Thought: Analyze volatility
        Sub-Thought: Measure the standard deviation of daily returns over a fixed period (e.g., 20 days)

Thought: Explore volume-based factors
    Sub-Thought: Consider the volume change
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume from one day to the next
    Sub-Thought: Examine the relationship between price and volume
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of today's high to yesterday's close, and multiply it by today's volume
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of today's low to yesterday's close, and multiply it by today's volume

Thought: Analyze trading activity
    Sub-Thought: Evaluate the amount traded
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily average amount traded over a fixed period (e.g., 20 days)
    Sub-Thought: Observe the correlation between amount traded and price movement
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily amount traded and the daily returns

Thought: Incorporate high and low prices
    Sub-Thought: Construct a range-based factor
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the range as (high[t] - low[t])
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the true range (TR) as the maximum of (high[t] - low[t]), (high[t] - close[t-1]), and (close[t-1] - low[t])
    Sub-Thought: Develop an intraday momentum factor
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between the open and close price (open[t] - close[t])
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between the close and the previous day's close (close[t] - close[t-1])
