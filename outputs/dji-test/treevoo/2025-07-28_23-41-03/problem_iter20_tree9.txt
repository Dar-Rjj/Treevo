Thought: Synthesize price patterns, volume interactions, and momentum indicators for alpha factor generation
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze the relationship between closing price and daily range with volume-weighted metrics
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of close to high (C/H) as a measure of day's performance
      - Sub-Thought: Examine the historical behavior of C/H ratios over different time windows
        - Sub-Thought: Identify trends or patterns in C/H ratios that correlate with future returns
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between high and low prices adjusted by volume (VWAP-like metric)
      - Sub-Thought: Use this adjusted price difference to assess market sentiment
        - Sub-Thought: Determine if this metric can predict short-term reversals or continuations
  - Sub-Thought: Utilize opening and closing prices to gauge market momentum and reversal signals
    - Sub-Thought: Measure the gap between opening and closing prices (O-C) to gauge market momentum
      - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the significance of O-C gaps over multiple days
        - Sub-Thought: Consider the cumulative effect of consecutive O-C gaps on future returns
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Return using Open and Close prices
      - Sub-Thought: Check Sign of the Intraday Return
        - Sub-Thought: Positive Return: Assign -1 (Reversal Signal)
        - Sub-Thought: Negative Return: Assign 1 (Reversal Signal)
  - Sub-Thought: Combine price and volume-based momentum indicators
    - Sub-Thought: Develop a simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
      - Sub-Thought: Compare the current close to the SMA to identify deviations
        - Sub-Thought: Check if these deviations are indicative of mean reversion or trend continuation
    - Sub-Thought: Construct a volume-weighted moving average (VWMA) of close prices
      - Sub-Thought: Assess the relationship between VWMA and recent price action
        - Sub-Thought: Determine the potential predictive power of VWMA crossovers
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate 20-Day Weighted Moving Average of Returns
      - Sub-Thought: Sum of (Daily Price Return * Volume) over 22 days
      - Sub-Thought: Divide by the sum of Volumes over 22 days
    - Sub-Thought: Adjust for Price Volatility
      - Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Price Range
        - Sub-Thought: Use High and Low prices
      - Sub-Thought: Calculate 20-Day Average Daily Price Range
      - Sub-Thought: Final Factor Value
        - Sub-Thought: 20-Day Weighted Moving Average of Returns
        - Sub-Thought: Subtract 20-Day Average Daily Price Range
  - Sub-Thought: Incorporate volume-weighted price change and ATR for enhanced combined factor
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume-Weighted Price
      - Sub-Thought: Sum of (Close price * Volume) over 22 days
      - Sub-Thought: Divide by the sum of Volumes over 22 days
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Difference between Current Close and Volume-Weighted Price
    - Sub-Thought: Compute Average True Range (ATR)
      - Sub-Thought: Use High, Low, and Previous Close
      - Sub-Thought: Take Maximum of Absolute Values
    - Sub-Thought: Multiply ATR by Reversal Signal
    - Sub-Thought: Add to 20-Day Weighted Moving Average of Returns
    - Sub-Thought: Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with Short Period
  - Sub-Thought: Examine the interaction between price levels and volume spikes
    - Sub-Thought: Monitor the volume at significant price levels (support, resistance) to detect potential breakouts or bounces
      - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the predictive value of these interactions for future stock returns
    - Sub-Thought: Identify significant price levels (support, resistance) using previous high and low points
      - Sub-Thought: Monitor the volume at these levels to detect potential breakouts or bounces
        - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the predictive value of these interactions for future stock returns
