Thought: Synthesize Price Patterns, Volume Interactions, and Intraday-Historical Momentum for Alpha Factor Generation
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze the relationship between closing price and daily range
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of close to high (C/H) as a measure of day's performance
      - Sub-Thought: Examine the historical behavior of C/H ratios over different time windows
        - Sub-Thought: Identify trends or patterns in C/H ratios that correlate with future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Investigate the impact of volume on price movements
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between high and low prices adjusted by volume (VWAP-like metric)
      - Sub-Thought: Use this adjusted price difference to assess market sentiment
        - Sub-Thought: Determine if this metric can predict short-term reversals or continuations
  - Sub-Thought: Utilize opening price in conjunction with other data points
    - Sub-Thought: Measure the gap between opening and closing prices (O-C) to gauge market momentum
      - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the significance of O-C gaps over multiple days
        - Sub-Thought: Consider the cumulative effect of consecutive O-C gaps on future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Explore indicators based on price and volume changes
    - Sub-Thought: Develop a simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
      - Sub-Thought: Compare the current close to the SMA to identify deviations
        - Sub-Thought: Check if these deviations are indicative of mean reversion or trend continuation
    - Sub-Thought: Construct a volume-weighted moving average (VWMA) of close prices
      - Sub-Thought: Assess the relationship between VWMA and recent price action
        - Sub-Thought: Determine the potential predictive power of VWMA crossovers
  - Sub-Thought: Examine the interaction between price levels and volume spikes
    - Sub-Thought: Identify significant price levels (support, resistance) using previous high and low points
      - Sub-Thought: Monitor the volume at these levels to detect potential breakouts or bounces
        - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the predictive value of these interactions for future stock returns
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate multiple factors to create a composite alpha factor
    - Sub-Thought: Combine C/H ratio, VWAP-like metric, and O-C gap into a single factor
      - Sub-Thought: Weigh each component based on its historical predictive power
        - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the combined factor's performance in predicting future returns
    - Sub-Thought: Incorporate SMA and VWMA crossovers with support and resistance levels
      - Sub-Thought: Create a composite signal that considers both price and volume dynamics
        - Sub-Thought: Assess the effectiveness of this multi-factor approach in generating alpha
  - Sub-Thought: Synthesize intraday and historical momentum with volume-adjusted high-low range
    - Sub-Thought: Price Momentum
      - Sub-Thought: Intraday Momentum
        - Sub-Thought: (Close - Open)
      - Sub-Thought: Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
        - Sub-Thought: 50-day SMA
        - Sub-Thought: 100-day SMA
        - Sub-Thought: 200-day SMA
      - Sub-Thought: Combined Momentum
        - Sub-Thought: (50-day SMA - 100-day SMA) + (100-day SMA - 200-day SMA)
        - Sub-Thought: Add Intraday Momentum
    - Sub-Thought: Volume-Adjusted Factors
      - Sub-Thought: Volume-Adjusted Return
        - Sub-Thought: (Close - Open) * (Volume / Average Volume of Last N Days)
      - Sub-Thought: Volume-Weighted Price Movement
        - Sub-Thought: (High - Low) * Volume
    - Sub-Thought: High-Low Range Momentum
      - Sub-Thought: High-Low Range
        - Sub-Thought: (High - Low)
      - Sub-Thought: Adjusted High-Low Range
        - Sub-Thought: (Today's High-Low Range - Previous Day's High-Low Range)
      - Sub-Thought: High-Low Range Momentum
        - Sub-Thought: (Adjusted High-Low Range / Average Volume)
    - Sub-Thought: Final Alpha Factor Combination
      - Sub-Thought: Combine Momentum and Volume-Adjusted Factors
        - Sub-Thought: (Combined Momentum) + (Volume-Adjusted Factors)
      - Sub-Thought: Combine with High-Low Range Momentum
        - Sub-Thought: (High-Low Range Momentum / Average Volume)
      - Sub-Thought: Weighted Sum
        - Sub-Thought: (Momentum and Volume-Adjusted Factors) *
