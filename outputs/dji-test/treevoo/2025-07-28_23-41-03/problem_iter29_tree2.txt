Thought: Begin by exploring price-based and volume-weighted factors
    Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily return
        Sub-Thought: Use the close prices to calculate daily returns (close[t] / close[t-1] - 1)
    Sub-Thought: Investigate the concept of price momentum
        Sub-Thought: Compute a short-term moving average (e.g., 5-day MA) of closing prices
            Sub-Thought: Subtract the 5-day MA from the close price to observe short-term deviations
        Sub-Thought: Compute a long-term moving average (e.g., 20-day MA) of closing prices
            Sub-Thought: Subtract the 20-day MA from the close price to observe long-term deviations
    Sub-Thought: Analyze volatility
        Sub-Thought: Measure the standard deviation of daily returns over a fixed period (e.g., 20 days)
    Sub-Thought: Develop a Volume-Weighted Price Movement Factor
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) using (High + Low + Close) / 3 * Volume
        Sub-Thought: Compute the 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWAP
        Sub-Thought: Compute the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWAP
        Sub-Thought: Use the ratio of the 10-day EMA to the 50-day EMA as a factor

Thought: Explore volume-based and money flow factors
    Sub-Thought: Consider the volume change
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume from one day to the next
    Sub-Thought: Examine the relationship between price and volume
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of today's high to yesterday's close, and multiply it by today's volume
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of today's low to yesterday's close, and multiply it by today's volume
    Sub-Thought: Develop a Money Flow Index (MFI) using High, Low, Close, and Volume
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the Typical Price (TP) using (High + Low + Close) / 3
        Sub-Thought: Compute the Money Flow (MF) by multiplying TP by Volume
        Sub-Thought: Determine the Positive Money Flow (PMF) and Negative Money Flow (NMF) based on whether TP is greater or less than the previous day's TP
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the 14-day positive money flow and 14-day negative money flow
        Sub-Thought: Use the MFI calculated with the formula: MFI = 100 - (100 / (1 + MR)) as a factor

Thought: Analyze trading activity and relative strength
    Sub-Thought: Evaluate the amount traded
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily average amount traded over a fixed period (e.g., 20 days)
    Sub-Thought: Observe the correlation between amount traded and price movement
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily amount traded and the daily returns
    Sub-Thought: Create a Relative Strength Index (RSI) based on Close Prices
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the daily price change using Close(t) - Close(t-1)
        Sub-Thought: Separate the gains and losses from the daily price changes
        Sub-Thought: Compute the 14-day average gain and 14-day average loss
        Sub-Thought: Use the RSI calculated with the formula: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (average gain / average loss))) as a factor

Thought: Incorporate high and low prices and true range
    Sub-Thought: Construct a range-based factor
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the range as (high[t] - low[t])
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the true range (TR) as the maximum of (high[t] - low[t]), (high[t] - close[t-1]), and (close[t-1] - low[t])
    Sub-Thought: Develop an intraday momentum factor
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between the open and close price (open[t] - close[t])
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between the close and the previous day's close (close[t] - close[t-1])
    Sub-Thought: Construct a Volatility Factor using High and Low Prices
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the average True Range (ATR) using the formula ATR = (High - Low)
        Sub-Thought: Use the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of ATR as a measure of volatility
