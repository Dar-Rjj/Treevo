- Calculate Momentum Indicators
  - Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
    - Short-term SMA (e.g., 5-day)
    - Long-term SMA (e.g., 20-day)
  - Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
    - Short-term EMA (e.g., 5-day)
    - Long-term EMA (e.g., 20-day)
- Calculate Volume Indicators
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
- Calculate Volatility Indicators
  - Average True Range (ATR) over a period (e.g., 14 days)
- Calculate Oscillators
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI) over a period (e.g., 14 days)
- Combine Indicators
  - Momentum and Volume
    - SMA cross with OBV trend
  - Momentum and Volatility
    - EMA cross with ATR trend
  - Momentum and Oscillator
    - RSI with SMA/EMA trends
- Price Patterns
  - Bullish/Bearish Engulfing Pattern
  - Bullish/Bearish Harami Pattern
- Generate Alpha Factors
  - Factor 1: (Short-term SMA - Long-term SMA) / Close
  - Factor 2: (Short-term EMA - Long-term EMA) / Close
  - Factor 3: OBV / Volume
  - Factor 4: ATR / High
  - Factor 5: RSI
  - Factor 6: (Close - Open) / (High - Low)
  - Factor 7: If Bullish Engulfing or Bearish Engulfing, then 1, else 0
  - Factor 8: If Bullish Harami or Bearish Harami, then 1, else 0
  - Factor 9: (Factor 1 + Factor 2 + Factor 3 + Factor 4 + Factor 5 + Factor 6 + Factor 7 + Factor 8) / 8
