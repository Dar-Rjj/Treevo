```python
def heuristics_v2(df):
    # Calculate the price change from the previous day's close to the current open
    df['price_change'] = df['open'] - df['close'].shift(1)
    
    # Calculate the average of the high and low prices
    df['avg_price'] = (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2
    
    # Calculate the difference between the close and the average price
    df['diff_close_avg'] = df['close'] - df['avg_price']
    
    # Calculate the factor as a combination of the above features
    df['factor'] = (df['price_change'] * df['volume']) + df['diff_close_avg']
    
    # Return the factor as a pandas Series
    return df['factor']
