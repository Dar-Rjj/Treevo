Thought: Explore price patterns and volume interactions for alpha factor generation
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze the relationship between closing price and daily range
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the ratio of close to high (C/H) as a measure of day's performance
      - Sub-Thought: Examine the historical behavior of C/H ratios over different time windows
        - Sub-Thought: Identify trends or patterns in C/H ratios that correlate with future returns
          - Sub-Thought: Incorporate the rolling average of C/H ratios to identify consistent performance
          - Sub-Thought: Examine the cumulative sum of C/H ratios over a period to identify momentum
  - Sub-Thought: Investigate the impact of volume on price movements
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between high and low prices adjusted by volume (VWAP-like metric)
      - Sub-Thought: Use this adjusted price difference to assess market sentiment
        - Sub-Thought: Determine if this metric can predict short-term reversals or continuations
          - Sub-Thought: Combine the VWAP-like metric with other volume indicators for enhanced prediction
        - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the effect of volume spikes on the adjusted price difference
          - Sub-Thought: Assess the predictive power of volume spikes at support and resistance levels
  - Sub-Thought: Utilize opening price in conjunction with other data points
    - Sub-Thought: Measure the gap between opening and closing prices (O-C) to gauge market momentum
      - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the significance of O-C gaps over multiple days
        - Sub-Thought: Consider the cumulative effect of consecutive O-C gaps on future returns
          - Sub-Thought: Integrate the O-C gap with the trend of open and close prices for a more comprehensive analysis
      - Sub-Thought: Compare the O-C gap with the previous day's gap to identify directional changes
        - Sub-Thought: Assess the predictive value of O-C gap changes for trend reversals
  - Sub-Thought: Explore indicators based on price and volume changes
    - Sub-Thought: Develop a simple moving average (SMA) of close prices
      - Sub-Thought: Compare the current close to the SMA to identify deviations
        - Sub-Thought: Check if these deviations are indicative of mean reversion or trend continuation
          - Sub-Thought: Incorporate the slope of the SMA to capture the direction of the trend
        - Sub-Thought: Examine the interaction between SMA and volume spikes for trend strength
          - Sub-Thought: Assess the predictive power of SMA crossovers in conjunction with volume spikes
    - Sub-Thought: Construct a volume-weighted moving average (VWMA) of close prices
      - Sub-Thought: Assess the relationship between VWMA and recent price action
        - Sub-Thought: Determine the potential predictive power of VWMA crossovers
          - Sub-Thought: Analyze the interaction between VWMA and standard deviation of close prices for volatility insights
        - Sub-Thought: Compare the VWMA with the simple moving average (SMA) to identify divergence
          - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the predictive value of VWMA-SMA divergence for future price movements
  - Sub-Thought: Examine the interaction between price levels and volume spikes
    - Sub-Thought: Identify significant price levels (support, resistance) using previous high and low points
      - Sub-Thought: Monitor the volume at these levels to detect potential breakouts or bounces
        - Sub-Thought: Evaluate the predictive value of these interactions for future stock returns
          - Sub-Thought: Use the number of volume spikes at support and resistance levels to gauge breakout strength
        - Sub-Thought: Analyze the persistence of volume spikes at key price levels
          - Sub-Thought: Assess the impact of repeated volume spikes on future price movements
