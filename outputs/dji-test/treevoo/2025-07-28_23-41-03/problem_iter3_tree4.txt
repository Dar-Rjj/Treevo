│   └── Subtract previous day's range from today's range
├── Adjust by Volume and Amount
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Sum Volume over past n days
│   └── Divide by n to get average volume
│   ├── Use Amount
│   ├── Sum Amount over past m days
│   └── Divide by m to get average amount
└── Combine High-Low Range Momentum and Volume-Amount Adjustment
    ├── Use High-Low Range Momentum
    └── Divide by (Average Volume + Average Amount)
