Thought: Explore Momentum-Based Factors
- Sub-Thought: Calculate simple moving average (SMA) based factors
  - Sub-Thought: Use different lengths for SMA, like 5, 10, 20, and 50 days
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the difference between current close and SMA as a factor
- Sub-Thought: Implement return-based momentum
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate returns over various look-back periods, e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 3 months
    - Sub-Thought: Use these returns directly as factors
- Sub-Thought: Create a composite momentum indicator
  - Sub-Thought: Combine different momentum indicators with varying weights
    - Sub-Thought: Adjust weight based on recent volatility to emphasize more stable trends

Thought: Investigate Volume-Weighted Price Indicators
- Sub-Thought: Develop volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
  - Sub-Thought: Consider VWAP over multiple periods, such as 1 day, 1 week, 1 month
    - Sub-Thought: Utilize the deviation of the current close from VWAP as a factor
- Sub-Thought: Construct a volume-weighted moving average (VWMA)
  - Sub-Thought: Apply VWMA over different time frames
    - Sub-Thought: Use the slope of VWMA as an additional alpha factor
- Sub-Thought: Analyze the interaction between price and volume
  - Sub-Thought: Formulate a factor that incorporates the correlation between daily returns and volume changes

Thought: Leverage Volatility and Range-Based Indicators
- Sub-Thought: Compute historical volatility using standard deviation of returns
  - Sub-Thought: Experiment with different time windows for volatility calculation
    - Sub-Thought: Employ volatility as a standalone factor or in combination with other factors
- Sub-Thought: Derive factors from high-low range
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over a specified period
    - Sub-Thought: Use ATR to identify potential breakouts or trend strength
- Sub-Thought: Examine Bollinger Bands
  - Sub-Thought: Use Bollinger Bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions
    - Sub-Thought: Create a factor based on the distance of the current price from the upper or lower Bollinger Band

Thought: Design Pattern Recognition and Technical Indicator-Based Factors
- Sub-Thought: Identify and quantify candlestick patterns
  - Sub-Thought: Implement algorithms to detect common patterns like Doji, Hammer, and Engulfing
    - Sub-Thought: Assign scores to each pattern and use them as factors
- Sub-Thought: Integrate classical technical indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Incorporate relative strength index (RSI), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and stochastic oscillator
    - Sub-Thought: Use the values and signals from these indicators as predictive factors
- Sub-Thought: Combine multiple technical indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Create a composite score by combining RSI, MACD, and Stochastic Oscillator
    - Sub-Thought: Optimize the weights of each component in the composite score
