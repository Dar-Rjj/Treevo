Thought: Explore Price and Volume Patterns for Alpha Generation
- Sub-thought: Analyze Candlestick Features
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Real Body as (Close - Open)
    - Sub-thought: Use Real Body to Identify Bullish and Bearish Candles
      - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Sum of Consecutive Bullish Real Bodies
      - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Sum of Consecutive Bearish Real Bodies
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Shadow Lengths
    - Sub-thought: Upper Shadow = High - Max(Close, Open)
      - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Average of Last 5 Days' Upper Shadows
    - Sub-thought: Lower Shadow = Min(Close, Open) - Low
      - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Average of Last 5 Days' Lower Shadows
- Sub-thought: Analyze Volume and Amount Data
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Change
    - Sub-thought: Daily Volume Change = Today's Volume - Yesterday's Volume
      - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Sign of Volume Change
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Amount Change
    - Sub-thought: Daily Amount Change = Today's Amount - Yesterday's Amount
      - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Sign of Amount Change
- Sub-thought: Combine Price and Volume Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Use Price and Volume Combination
    - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Bullish Candles with Increasing Volume
      - Sub-thought: Condition: Real Body > 0 and Daily Volume Change > 0
    - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Bearish Candles with Decreasing Volume
      - Sub-thought: Condition: Real Body < 0 and Daily Volume Change < 0
- Sub-thought: Incorporate Moving Averages
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    - Sub-thought: SMA_5 = 5-Day Simple Moving Average
    - Sub-thought: SMA_10 = 10-Day Simple Moving Average
    - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Close Price Relative to SMA_5
    - Sub-thought: Create Factor: SMA_5 Relative to SMA_10
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Price Momentum
    - Sub-thought: Price Momentum = Close - Close[5_days_ago]
      - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Price Momentum over 5 Days
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Volume Momentum
    - Sub-thought: Volume Momentum = Volume - Volume[5_days_ago]
      - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Volume Momentum over 5 Days
- Sub-thought: Combine Momentum and Moving Averages
  - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Positive Price Momentum Above SMA_5
    - Sub-thought: Condition: Price Momentum > 0 and Close > SMA_5
  - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Negative Price Momentum Below SMA_5
    - Sub-thought: Condition: Price Momentum < 0 and Close < SMA_5
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Calculate True Range
    - Sub-thought: True Range = Max(High - Low, Abs(High - Previous Close), Abs(Low - Previous Close))
      - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Average True Range (ATR) over 5 Days
- Sub-thought: Combine Volatility and Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Create Factor: High Volatility and Positive Momentum
    - Sub-thought: Condition: ATR > Threshold and Price Momentum > 0
  - Sub-thought: Create Factor: Low Volatility and Negative Momentum
    - Sub-thought: Condition: ATR < Threshold and Price Momentum < 0
