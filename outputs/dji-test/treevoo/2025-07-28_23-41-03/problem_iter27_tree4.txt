Thought: Create a Modified Momentum Indicator using Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Determine the percentage difference between the 10-day SMA and 20-day SMA
- Sub-thought: Use the percentage difference as a momentum factor

Thought: Develop an Enhanced Volume-Weighted Price Movement Factor
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) using (High + Low + 2*Close) / 4 * Volume
- Sub-thought: Compute the 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWAP
- Sub-thought: Compute the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWAP
- Sub-thought: Determine the logarithmic ratio of the 10-day EMA to the 50-day EMA
- Sub-thought: Use the logarithmic ratio as a factor

Thought: Construct a Modified Volatility Factor using High and Low Prices
- Sub-thought: Calculate the average True Range (ATR) using the formula ATR = (High - Low)
- Sub-thought: Compute the 14-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of ATR
- Sub-thought: Use the 14-day EMA of ATR as a measure of volatility

Thought: Create a Modified Relative Strength Index (RSI) based on Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Calculate the daily price change using Close(t) - Close(t-1)
- Sub-thought: Separate the gains and losses from the daily price changes
- Sub-thought: Compute the 14-day average gain and 14-day average loss
- Sub-thought: Calculate the RSI using the formula: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (average gain / average loss)))
- Sub-thought: Apply a smoothing factor to the RSI using a 3-day EMA
- Sub-thought: Use the smoothed RSI as a factor

Thought: Develop a Modified Money Flow Index (MFI) using High, Low, Close, and Volume
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Typical Price (TP) using (High + Low + 2*Close) / 4
- Sub-thought: Compute the Money Flow (MF) by multiplying TP by Volume
- Sub-thought: Determine the Positive Money Flow (PMF) and Negative Money Flow (NMF) based on whether TP is greater or less than the previous day's TP
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 14-day positive money flow and 14-day negative money flow
- Sub-thought: Compute the Money Ratio (MR) using 14-day PMF / 14-day NMF
- Sub-thought: Calculate the MFI using the formula: MFI = 100 - (100 / (1 + MR))
- Sub-thought: Apply a smoothing factor to the MFI using a 3-day EMA
- Sub-thought: Use the smoothed MFI as a factor
