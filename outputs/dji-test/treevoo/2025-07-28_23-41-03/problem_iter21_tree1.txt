Thought: Create a Momentum Indicator using Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Determine the difference between the 10-day SMA and 20-day SMA
- Sub-thought: Use the difference as a momentum factor, where positive values indicate bullish momentum and negative values indicate bearish momentum

Thought: Develop a Volume-Weighted Price Movement Factor
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) using (High + Low + Close) / 3 * Volume
- Sub-thought: Compute the 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWAP
- Sub-thought: Compute the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of VWAP
- Sub-thought: Determine the ratio of the 10-day EMA to the 50-day EMA
- Sub-thought: Use the ratio as a factor, where values above 1 suggest a strong price movement and below 1 suggest weakness

Thought: Construct a Volatility Factor using High and Low Prices
- Sub-thought: Calculate the average True Range (ATR) using the formula ATR = (High - Low)
- Sub-thought: Compute the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of ATR
- Sub-thought: Use the 14-day SMA of ATR as a measure of volatility
- Sub-thought: Higher ATR values indicate higher volatility, which can be used to predict future returns

Thought: Create a Relative Strength Index (RSI) based on Close Prices
- Sub-thought: Calculate the daily price change using Close(t) - Close(t-1)
- Sub-thought: Separate the gains and losses from the daily price changes
- Sub-thought: Compute the 14-day average gain and 14-day average loss
- Sub-thought: Calculate the RSI using the formula: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (average gain / average loss)))
- Sub-thought: Use the RSI as a factor, where values above 70 indicate overbought conditions and below 30 indicate oversold conditions

Thought: Develop a Money Flow Index (MFI) using High, Low, Close, and Volume
- Sub-thought: Calculate the Typical Price (TP) using (High + Low + Close) / 3
- Sub-thought: Compute the Money Flow (MF) by multiplying TP by Volume
- Sub-thought: Determine the Positive Money Flow (PMF) and Negative Money Flow (NMF) based on whether TP is greater or less than the previous day's TP
- Sub-thought: Calculate the 14-day positive money flow and 14-day negative money flow
- Sub-thought: Compute the Money Ratio (MR) using 14-day PMF / 14-day NMF
- Sub-thought: Calculate the MFI using the formula: MFI = 100 - (100 / (1 + MR))
- Sub-thought: Use the MFI as a factor, where values above 80 indicate overbought conditions and below 20 indicate oversold conditions
