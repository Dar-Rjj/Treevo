Volume-Adjusted Momentum with Price Fluctuation Integration
├── Calculate Short-Term Return
│   ├── Use Close price (t)
│   └── Use Close price (t-n, where n is a short lookback period e.g., 5 days)
├── Calculate Long-Term Return
│   ├── Use Close price (t)
│   └── Use Close price (t-m, where m is a long lookback period e.g., 20 days)
├── Calculate Momentum Indicator
│   ├── Subtract Short-Term Return from Long-Term Return
│   └── Assign a positive or negative value based on the sign of the result
├── Calculate Price Fluctuation
│   ├── Use High price (t) - Low price (t)
├── Integrate Volume into the Factor
│   ├── Use Volume (t)
│   ├── Sum Volume over the short-term lookback period (sum of past 5 days)
│   └── Weight the momentum indicator by the sum of volume
└── Combine Momentum and Price Fluctuation
    ├── Multiply the momentum-weighted by integrated volume
    └── Adjust the result by the daily price fluctuation
