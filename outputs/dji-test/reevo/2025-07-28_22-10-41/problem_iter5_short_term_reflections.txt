Integrate more diverse signals, weight factors dynamically, and use advanced statistical models for feature engineering.
Consider log returns, EMAs, and volatility for more dynamic, responsive factors. Balance weights to emphasize predictive components.
Incorporate relative strength, liquidity, and mean reversion for more robust alpha factor generation.
Incorporate volume, use relative price changes, and combine multiple smoothed indicators for robustness.
Incorporate more sophisticated indicators, use weighting, and consider longer-term trends for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Incorporate weights, use longer momentum, and normalize features for improved factor stability and interpretability.
Incorporate more dynamic elements, like volume changes, and use broader time windows for volatility.
Consider integrating macroeconomic indicators and use adaptive moving averages for more responsive trend signals.
Incorporate trend, mean reversion, and volatility measures. Use longer smoothing periods and combine multiple indicators.
Incorporate diverse indicators, normalize, and weight factors for balanced contribution.
