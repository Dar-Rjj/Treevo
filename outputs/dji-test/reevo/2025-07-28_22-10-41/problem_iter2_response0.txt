```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the price range as a measure of volatility
    price_range = df['high'] - df['low']
    
    # Calculate the return from open to close
    return_open_to_close = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Smooth the return over the last 3 days
    return_smoothed = return_open_to_close.rolling(window=3).mean()
    
    # Novel alpha factor: Ratio of smoothed return to recent price range (volatility)
    # This factor reflects the smooth momentum relative to recent volatility
    alpha_factor = return_smoothed / price_range
    
    return alpha_factor
