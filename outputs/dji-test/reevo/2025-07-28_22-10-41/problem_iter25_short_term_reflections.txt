Incorporate dynamic weights, market microstructure, and normalization for enhanced factor performance and interpretability.
Incorporate macroeconomic data, normalize factors, and use rolling standard deviation for volatility.
Incorporate volatility and smoothed stochastic for stability; dynamically adjust weights based on market conditions.
Use logistic functions for adaptive weights, incorporate market microstructure, and normalize the final factor.
Incorporate more adaptive weights, add market microstructure, and refine volatility and mean reversion indicators.
Balance weights, incorporate macroeconomic data, and use adaptive indicators for better alpha factor performance.
Incorporate adaptive weighting, consider market microstructure, and balance factor contributions for improved performance.
Incorporate more dynamic weighting, add volatility and mean-reversion, and normalize the final factor.
Incorporate more diverse indicators, balance with adaptive weights, and normalize for stability.
Use logistic functions for adaptive weights, incorporate market microstructure, and normalize the final factor.
