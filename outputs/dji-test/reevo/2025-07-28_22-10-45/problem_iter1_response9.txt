```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between high and low as a volatility measure
    volatility = df['high'] - df['low']
    
    # Calculate the closing price relative to the average of high and low
    close_to_avg = (df['close'] - (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2)
    
    # Calculate the trading volume ratio, normalized by the 5-day moving average of volume
    volume_ratio = df['volume'] / df['volume'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    
    # Combine the factors: volatility adjusted close-to-avg with volume impact
    factor = (close_to_avg / (volatility + 1e-7)) * volume_ratio
