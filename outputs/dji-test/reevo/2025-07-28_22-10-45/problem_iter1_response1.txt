```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between closing price and average of high and low
    avg_high_low = (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2
    close_to_avg = df['close'] - avg_high_low
    
    # Volume change compared to previous day, use .shift(1) for lag
    volume_change = (df['volume'] - df['volume'].shift(1)) / (df['volume'].shift(1) + 1e-7)
    
    # Alpha factor: weighted sum of close to average movement and volume change
    alpha_factor = close_to_avg * (1 + volume_change)
    
    return alpha_factor
