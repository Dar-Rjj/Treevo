```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between close and open price (daily return)
    daily_return = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate the average of high and low for the day
    avg_high_low = (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2
    
    # Calculate the factor as the ratio of daily return to the average of high and low
    factor = daily_return / (avg_high_low + 1e-7)
    
    # Adjust the factor by incorporating volume, assuming higher volume indicates stronger signal
    adjusted_factor = factor * np.log(df['volume'] + 1)
    
    return adjusted_factor
