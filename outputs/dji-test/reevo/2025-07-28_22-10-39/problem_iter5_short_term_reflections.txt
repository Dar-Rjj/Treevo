Focus on integrating smoothed relative positions, momentum, and normalized price levels.
Incorporate relative strength, normalize by sector, and consider market cap for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate volatility, leverage advanced mean calculations, and utilize more sophisticated momentum measures.
Incorporate more price dynamics, use exponential smoothing, and consider market depth for enhanced signal.
Incorporate more market dynamics, like volume and price averages, and combine factors for robustness.
Incorporate market momentum, volume-weighted prices, and relative positions for enhanced alpha factor robustness.
Incorporate relative strength, use adaptive windows, and consider liquidity measures for robust alpha generation.
Incorporate momentum, position relative to range, and standardized price levels; use EMA for smoother trends.
Incorporate more price-derived features, use exponential moving averages, and consider momentum for enhanced alpha factor robustness.
Incorporate momentum, mean reversion, and relative strength for enhanced predictive power.
