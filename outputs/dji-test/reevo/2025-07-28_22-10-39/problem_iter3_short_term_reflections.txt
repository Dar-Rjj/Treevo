Integrate volume, consider volatility, and blend multiple time frames for robustness.
Integrate volume, use moving averages, and consider volatility for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate volatility, trend strength, and volume changes; utilize longer-term moving averages for stability.
Incorporate price trends, volume, and volatility. Use rolling statistics and ratios for more dynamic factors.
Incorporate volatility, momentum, and liquidity measures; use advanced statistical methods for normalization and factor combination.
Incorporate smoothed momentum, relative price position, and consider additional technical indicators for richer factor diversity.
Incorporate price momentum, relative strength, and liquidity measures; use exponential smoothing for trends.
Incorporate volatility, trend strength, and volume-weighted price changes for more robust and dynamic alpha factors.
Incorporate more sophisticated momentum, use smoothed relative position, and explore additional market dynamics like volatility clustering.
Incorporate volume, refine shadow and body ratios, and consider smoothing techniques for stability.
