```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the closing price and the average of the highest and lowest prices
    avg_high_low = (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2
    factor = df['close'] - avg_high_low
    
    # Calculate the momentum component by looking at the change in volume
    volume_change = df['volume'].pct_change().fillna(0)
    
    # Combine the two components to create the final factor
    combined_factor = (factor * volume_change).rolling(window=5).mean()
    
    return combined_factor
```
