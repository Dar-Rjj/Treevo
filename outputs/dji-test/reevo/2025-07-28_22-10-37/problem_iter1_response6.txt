```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between open and close prices, this factor could indicate the momentum during the day.
    momentum = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the last 5 days.
    # This may capture significant deviations in liquidity which could be related to market activity.
    avg_5d_volume = df['volume'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    volume_ratio = df['volume'] / (avg_5d_volume + 1e-7)
    
    # Combine the two factors into a single signal.
    combined_signal = (momentum * volume_ratio)
    
    return combined_signal
