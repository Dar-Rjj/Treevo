Incorporate multi-period analysis, use RSI for overbought/oversold signals, and combine with volatility and momentum.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and volume with adaptive weights; use advanced indicators like ATR for normalization.
Incorporate more advanced volatility measures, refine momentum with longer-term EMAs, and consider volume-weighted price differences.
Consider trend strength, intra-day volatility, and smart volume weighting for enhanced factor robustness.
Incorporate volatility, recent volume, and price changes. Use dynamic weighting and consider multiple timeframes for momentum.
Incorporate relative strength, use normalized indicators, and balance with adaptive weights for robustness.
Reduce complexity, focus on key indicators, and normalize factor weights for improved performance.
Integrate more sophisticated indicators, dynamic weighting, and consider market microstructure for enhanced alpha generation.
Incorporate more technical indicators, use dynamic weighting, and consider market trends for improved heuristics.
Focus on volatility normalization, volume surges, and adaptive weighting for enhanced factor stability and predictive power.
