```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between high and low, this is a measure of volatility
    volatility = df['high'] - df['low']
    
    # Calculate the change in closing price from one day to the next, this gives us the momentum
    df['close_lag'] = df['close'].shift(1)
    momentum = df['close'] - df['close_lag']
    
    # Create a factor that combines volatility and momentum.
    # The idea is stocks with higher momentum tend to keep going up (trend continuation), but 
    # if the stock has high volatility, it might not be a stable trend. 
    # This factor is high for stocks with strong upward momentum and relatively low volatility, suggesting a more stable trend.
    factor = (momentum / (volatility + 1e-7))

    return factor
