    # Create a factor that combines volatility, momentum, and volume adjustment.
    # The idea is stocks with higher momentum tend to keep going up (trend continuation), but 
    # if the stock has high volatility, it might not be a stable trend. Volume adjustment helps to
    # weigh the trend based on the trading volume.
