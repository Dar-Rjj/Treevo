```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the current close and the previous close as a percentage of the previous close
    df['close_change'] = (df['close'].diff() / df['close'].shift(1)).fillna(0)
    
    # Calculate the 5-day moving average of the close price
    df['close_ma_5'] = df['close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    
    # Calculate the relative close price compared to its 5-day moving average
    df['close_relative'] = df['close'] / (df['close_ma_5'] + 1e-7)
    
    # Calculate volume relative to its 5-period moving average
    df['volume_ma_5'] = df['volume'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    df['volume_relative'] = df['volume'] / (df['volume_ma_5'] + 1e-7)
    
    # Combine the price momentum, relative close price, and volume surge for alpha factor
    return df['close_change'] * df['close_relative'] * df['volume_relative']
