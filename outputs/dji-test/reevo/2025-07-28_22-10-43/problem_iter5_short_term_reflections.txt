Incorporate more sophisticated volatility measures and volume trends, use exponential smoothing for stability.
Incorporate multi-period moving averages, RSI, and ATR for a more robust, volatility-adjusted momentum factor.
Integrate more diverse signals, use adaptive windows, and apply advanced smoothing techniques.
Incorporate advanced statistical measures, multi-period analysis, and adaptive weighting for dynamic market conditions.
Incorporate relative measures, momentum, and volume changes; use rolling averages for smoothing.
Incorporate relative changes, use shorter moving averages, and combine price and volume momentum for enhanced signal.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use ATR for volatility, and normalize with recent volume for improved factor robustness.
Incorporate multiple timeframes, use RSI for momentum, ATR for volatility, and relative volume to enhance factor stability.
Focus on short-term trends, use relative changes, and combine price momentum with volume for enhanced signal.
Incorporate multiple time frames, use adaptive windows, and integrate market sentiment or macroeconomic indicators.
