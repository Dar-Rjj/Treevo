      Code: short_term_momentum = (close - close.shift(10)) / close.shift(10)
    Thought: Combine Long-Term and Short-Term Momentum
      Code: combined_momentum = long_term_momentum + short_term_momentum
    Thought: Calculate Realized Volatility
      Code: realized_volatility = (close.pct_change().rolling(window=20).std() * np.sqrt(252))

      Code: ema_smoothed_return = daily_close_to_close_return.ewm(span=5, adjust=False).mean()
    Thought: Adjust for Volume and Amount
      Code: total_volume = volume.rolling(window=5).sum()
      Code: total_amount = amount.rolling(window=5).sum()
