Volume Adjusted Momentum Score
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   ├── Compute Close-to-Close Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Compute difference between two consecutive days
│   └── Smooth with Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│       ├── Determine SMA window length (e.g., 5 days, 10 days, etc.)
│       └── Apply SMA to the close-to-close returns
└── Adjust for Volume
    ├── Summarize Volume over the SMA period
    │   ├── Aggregate total volume of the last n days (same as SMA window length)
    └── Calculate Ratio of Momentum to Volume
        ├── Divide SMA smoothed return by the summarized volume
        └── Output Volume Adjusted Momentum Score as the alpha factor
