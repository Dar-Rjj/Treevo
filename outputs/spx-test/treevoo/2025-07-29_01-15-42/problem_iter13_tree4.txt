├── Compute Daily Price Change

├── Calculate Realized Volatility
│   └── Use Close price with a rolling window of 20 days
└── Final Alpha Signal Based on Combined Indicators
    ├── If (Adjusted Price-Volume Signal > Threshold) and (Realized Volatility < Median)
    │   └── Set Alpha Factor to 1
    ├── If (Adjusted Price-Volume Signal < -Threshold) and (Realized Volatility < Median)
    │   └── Set Alpha Factor to -1
    └── Otherwise
        └── Set Alpha Factor to 0
