Thought: Synthesize Enhanced Alpha Factors from Price, Volume, and Amount Data to Predict Future Stock Returns
├── Analyze the Relationship Between Price Changes and Future Returns
│   ├── Calculate the Percentage Change in Closing Price
│   │   └── Use (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
│   ├── Introduce a Smoothing Factor to the Percentage Change
│   │   └── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with a Span of 5 Days
│   ├── Examine the Average of the Past n Days' Closing Prices
│   │   └── Use a Simple Moving Average (SMA) over the Last 20 Days
│   ├── Compare Today's Closing Price with the Moving Average
│   │   ├── Determine if Today’s Closing Price is Above or Below the SMA
│   │   │   └── If Close_t > SMA_20, it May Indicate a Bullish Trend
│   │   │   └── If Close_t < SMA_20, it May Indicate a Bearish Trend
│   │   └── Introduce a Threshold to Filter Out Minor Deviations from the SMA
│   │       └── If |Close_t - SMA_20| > Threshold, Signal a Significant Move
├── Investigate the Impact of Volume on Future Returns
│   ├── Calculate the Ratio of Today's Volume to the Average Volume Over the Past n Days
│   │   └── Use Volume_t / Average(Volume_(t-20:t))
│   ├── Consider the Direction of the Price Change in Conjunction with the Volume Ratio
│   │   ├── If High Volume with Positive Price Change, Suggests Buying Pressure
│   │   └── If High Volume with Negative Price Change, Suggests Selling Pressure
│   ├── Analyze the Relationship Between Price and Volume
│   │   ├── Check if a High Volume Day is Accompanied by a Large Price Change
│   │   │   ├── If High Volume and Large Positive Price Change, Indicate Strong Buying
│   │   │   └── If High Volume and Large Negative Price Change, Indicate Strong Selling
│   │   └── Incorporate the High-Low Range into the Analysis to Capture Intraday Volatility
├── Explore the Use of Range-Based Indicators
│   ├── Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) Over the Past n Days
│   │   └── Use ATR to Indicate Volatility
│   │       ├── High ATR Values May Indicate Higher Volatility
│   │       └── Low ATR Values May Indicate Lower Volatility
│   │           └── Combine ATR with Percentage Change to Create a Volatility-Adjusted Momentum Indicator
│   ├── Calculate the Percentage of the Daily Range that the Closing Price Covers
│   │   └── Use (Close_t - Low_t) / (High_t - Low_t)
│   │       ├── If Close_t Near High_t, May Indicate Bullish Sentiment
│   │       └── If Close_t Near Low_t, May Indicate Bearish Sentiment
│   │           └── Introduce a Threshold to Categorize the Relative Position of the Close within the Range
├── Consider the Relationship Between Closing Price and Volume, such as Price-Volume Trend (PVT)
│   ├── Extend PVT to Include the Difference Between the Current Day's PVT and Its Moving Average
│   │   └── Use PVT_t - EMA(PVT, 20)
│   │       └── Use the Difference to Identify Potential Divergences Between Price and Volume
├── Explore Patterns in the Amount Data Related to Transactions
│   ├── Investigate the Trend of the Amount by Comparing it with Its Own Moving Average
│   │   └── Use Amount_t - SMA(Amount, 20)
│   │       └── Integrate the Amount Trend with the Price and Volume Indicators for a More Comprehensive View
├── Combine Multiple Indicators for a Robust Signal
│   ├── Create a Composite Score Based on the Above Indicators
│   │   └── Assign Weights to Each Factor Based on Their Predictive Power
│   │       ├── Combined Momentum (weight: 0.4)
│   │       ├── Intraday High-Low Spread (weight: 0.3)
│   │       ├── Close-to-Open Movement (weight: 0.2)
│   │       └── Adjusted High-to-Low Range (weight: 0.1)
│   │           └── Sum of Weighed Components
│   └── Introduce a Dynamic Weighting System Based on Recent Performance
