Crossover Alpha Factor
├── Compute Daily Price Change
│   └── Close Price - Open Price
├── Calculate Moving Average Volume
│   └── Use Last 20 Days' Volumes
├── Generate Adjusted Price-Volume Signal
│   └── Divide Daily Price Change by Moving Average Volume
├── Calculate Realized Volatility
│   └── Use Close price with a rolling window of 20 days
├── Compute Momentum
│   └── Use Close prices with a rolling window of 10 days
│       └── (Current Close Price - Close Price 10 Days Ago)
├── Final Alpha Signal Based on Combined Indicators
    ├── If (Adjusted Price-Volume Signal > Threshold) and (Realized Volatility < Median) and (Momentum > 0)
    │   └── Set Alpha Factor to 1
    ├── If (Adjusted Price-Volume Signal < -Threshold) and (Realized Volatility < Median) and (Momentum < 0)
    │   └── Set Alpha Factor to -1
    └── Otherwise
        └── Set Alpha Factor to 0
