Thought: Synthesize alpha factors from price, volume, and amount data to predict future stock returns
- Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price from one day to the next
  - Sub-thought: Use the percentage change as a simple momentum indicator
    - Sub-thought: Introduce a smoothing factor to the percentage change to reduce noise
      - Sub-thought: Smooth with EMA
        - Sub-thought: Determine EMA window length (e.g., 10 days)
        - Sub-thought: Apply EMA to close-to-open returns
- Sub-thought: Compare today's closing price with the moving average of the past n days
  - Sub-thought: If the current close is above the moving average, it may indicate a bullish trend
  - Sub-thought: If the current close is below the moving average, it may indicate a bearish trend
- Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the past n days
  - Sub-thought: High volume with a positive price change suggests buying pressure
  - Sub-thought: High volume with a negative price change suggests selling pressure
- Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between high-low range and closing price
  - Sub-thought: If the closing price is near the high of the day, it may indicate a bullish sentiment
  - Sub-thought: If the closing price is near the low of the day, it may indicate a bearish sentiment
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Price Range Ratio
    - Sub-thought: Use High price
    - Sub-thought: Subtract Low price
    - Sub-thought: Divide by Close price
- Sub-thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over the past n days
  - Sub-thought: Combine ATR with the percentage change in closing price to create a volatility-adjusted momentum indicator
- Sub-thought: Extend Price-Volume Trend (PVT) to include the difference between the current day's PVT and its moving average
  - Sub-thought: Use the difference to identify potential divergences between price and volume
- Sub-thought: Investigate the trend of the amount by comparing it with its own moving average to signal buying or selling pressure
- Sub-thought: Create a composite score based on the above indicators
  - Sub-thought: Assign weights to each factor based on their predictive power
  - Sub-thought: Introduce a dynamic weighting system based on recent performance
- Sub-thought: Develop a momentum-based alpha factor that captures the direction and strength of the move from open to close
  - Sub-thought: Include the open-to-close change in the composite score to enhance intraday insights
- Sub-thought: Adjust for Volume and Amount
  - Sub-thought: Aggregate total volume over EMA period
  - Sub-thought: Aggregate total amount over EMA period
  - Sub-thought: Divide EMA smoothed return by sum of aggregated volume and amount
- Sub-thought: Combine Long-Term and Short-Term Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Long-Term Price Momentum
    - Sub-thought: Use Close price at t-28
    - Sub-thought: Use Close price at t
  - Sub-thought: Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
    - Sub-thought: Use Close price at t-7
    - Sub-thought: Use Close price at t
  - Sub-thought: Add Long-Term and Short-Term Momentum
- Sub-thought: Compute RTSI
  - Sub-thought: Accumulate Gains and Losses
    - Sub-thought: Use Close price
    - Sub-thought: Sum Positive Differences (Gains)
    - Sub-thought: Sum Negative Differences (Losses)
  - Sub-thought: Smooth Gains and Losses
    - Sub-thought: Use 14-period EMA for Gains
    - Sub-thought: Use 14-period EMA for Losses
  - Sub-thought: Calculate RTSI
    - Sub-thought: Use Smoothed Gains
    - Sub-thought: Divide by sum of Smoothed Gains and Losses
    - Sub-thought: Multiply by 100
- Sub-thought: Calculate Realized Volatility
  - Sub-thought: Use Close price
  - Sub-thought: Use a rolling window of 10 days
- Sub-thought: Weighted Average of Combined Components
  - Sub-thought: Assign Weights
    - Sub-thought: Combined Momentum (weight: 0.4)
    - Sub-thought: Price Range Ratio (weight: 0.2)
    - Sub-thought: RTSI (weight: 0.2)
    - Sub-thought: Realized Volatility (weight: 0
