Thought: Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume
  |
  -- Thought: Momentum Indicators
  |     |
  |     -- Sub-Thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of close prices over a short-term period (e.g., 5 days)
  |     -- Sub-Thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of close prices over a long-term period (e.g., 20 days)
  |     -- Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between the short-term SMA and the long-term SMA to identify momentum
  |
  -- Thought: Volume-Weighted Indicators
  |     |
  |     -- Sub-Thought: Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) using (close * volume) / sum(volume) over a given period
  |     -- Sub-Thought: Compare the current close price with VWAP to identify if the stock is overbought or oversold
  |     -- Sub-Thought: Use the difference between the close price and VWAP as an alpha factor
  |
  -- Thought: Price Volatility
         |
         -- Sub-Thought: Calculate the true range (TR) for each day as max(high - low, abs(high - previous close), abs(low - previous close))
         -- Sub-Thought: Compute the average true range (ATR) over a given period (e.g., 14 days)
         -- Sub-Thought: Use the ATR as a measure of volatility and incorporate it into the alpha factor
         -- Sub-Thought: Create a modified alpha factor by dividing the momentum indicator by the ATR to account for volatility
