Thought 1: Trend Following Factors
- Sub-thought 1.1: Moving Average Crossover
  - Sub-thought 1.1.1: Short-term moving average (e.g., 5-day) and long-term moving average (e.g., 20-day)
  - Calculation: 5-day SMA - 20-day SMA
- Sub-thought 1.2: Momentum Indicator
  - Sub-thought 1.2.1: Price change over a period (e.g., 10 days)
  - Calculation: Close(t) - Close(t-10)

Thought 2: Volume-based Factors
- Sub-thought 2.1: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
  - Calculation: Sum of volume on up days minus sum of volume on down days
- Sub-thought 2.2: Volume Oscillator
  - Sub-thought 2.2.1: Short-term average volume (e.g., 5-day) and long-term average volume (e.g., 20-day)
  - Calculation: (5-day Avg Volume / 20-day Avg Volume) - 1

Thought 3: Volatility-based Factors
- Sub-thought 3.1: Bollinger Bands
  - Sub-thought 3.1.1: 20-day moving average and standard deviation
  - Calculation: (Close - 20-day MA) / (2 * 20-day STD)
- Sub-thought 3.2: ATR (Average True Range)
  - Calculation: 14-day moving average of the true range

Thought 4: Pattern Recognition Factors
- Sub-thought 4.1: Inside Bar
  - Calculation: High(t) < High(t-1) AND Low(t) > Low(t-1)
- Sub-thought 4.2: Outside Bar
  - Calculation: High(t) > High(t-1) AND Low(t) < Low(t-1)

Thought 5: Composite Factors
- Sub-thought 5.1: Combine Trend and Volume
  - Calculation: (Short-term MA - Long-term MA) * (5-day Avg Volume / 20-day Avg Volume)
- Sub-thought 5.2: Combine Volatility and Momentum
  - Calculation: (Bollinger Band Value) * (Momentum Indicator)
