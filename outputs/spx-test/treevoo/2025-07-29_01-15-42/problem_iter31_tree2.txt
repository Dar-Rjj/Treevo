Integrated Price, Volume, and Amount Momentum with Dynamic Adjustments
├── Calculate Daily Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price at t
│   └── Subtract Open price of the next day (t+1)
├── Smooth with EMA
│   ├── Determine EMA window length (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Apply EMA to close-to-open returns
├── Adjust for Volume and Amount
│   ├── Aggregate total volume over EMA period
│   ├── Aggregate total amount over EMA period
│   └── Divide EMA smoothed return by sum of aggregated volume and amount
├── Combine Long-Term and Short-Term Momentum
│   ├── Calculate Long-Term Price Momentum
│   │   ├── Use Close price at t-28
│   │   └── Use Close price at t
│   ├── Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
│   │   ├── Use Close price at t-10
│   │   └── Use Close price at t
│   └── Add Long-Term and Short-Term Momentum
├── Calculate Price Range Ratio
│   ├── Use High price at t
│   ├── Subtract Low price at t
│   └── Divide by Close price at t
├── Compute RTSI
│   ├── Accumulate Gains and Losses
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   ├── Sum Positive Differences (Gains)
│   │   └── Sum Negative Differences (Losses)
│   ├── Smooth Gains and Losses
│   │   ├── Use 14-period EMA for Gains
│   │   └── Use 14-period EMA for Losses
│   └── Calculate RTSI
│       ├── Use Smoothed Gains
│       ├── Divide by sum of Smoothed Gains and Losses
│       └── Multiply by 100
├── Calculate Realized Volatility
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Use a rolling window of 20 days
├── Weighted Average of Combined Components
│   ├── Assign Weights
│   │   ├── Combined Momentum (weight: 0.3)
│   │   ├── Price Range Ratio (weight: 0.2)
│   │   ├── RTSI (weight: 0.1)
│   │   └── Realized Volatility (weight: 0.1)
│   └── Sum of Weighed Components
├── Dynamic Adjustment Factor
│   ├── Calculate 5-day and 20-day Moving Averages of Close Price
│   └── Calculate Difference between 5-day and 20-day MAs
└── Final Factor
    ├── Multiply Weighted Average by Adjusted Volume and Amount
    ├── Multiply by Dynamic Adjustment Factor
    └── Interpret as Alpha Factor
        ├── High values indicate strong combined momentum and price action
        └── Low values suggest weak or ambiguous combined signals
