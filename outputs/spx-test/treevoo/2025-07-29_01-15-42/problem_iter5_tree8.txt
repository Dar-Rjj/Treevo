Integrated Volume, Amount, and Price Action Momentum Score
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   ├── Compute Close-to-Close Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Compute difference between two consecutive days
│   └── Smooth with Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│       ├── Determine SMA window length (e.g., 5 days, 10 days, etc.)
│       └── Apply SMA to the close-to-close returns
├── Adjust for Volume and Amount
│   ├── Summarize Volume over the SMA period
│   │   ├── Aggregate total volume of the last n days (same as SMA window length)
│   └── Summarize Amount over the SMA period
│       ├── Aggregate total amount of the last n days (same as SMA window length)
│   └── Calculate Ratio of Momentum to Combined Volume and Amount
│       ├── Combine summarized volume and amount by summing them
│       ├── Divide SMA smoothed return by the combined total
│       └── Output Volume and Amount Adjusted Momentum Score
├── Calculate Daily Price Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Subtract Low price
├── Calculate Price Range Ratio
│   ├── Use Daily Price Range
│   └── Divide by Open price
├── Compute Relative True Strength Index (RTSI)
│   ├── Accumulate Gains and Losses
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   ├── Compare with Previous Close
│   │   ├── Sum Positive Differences (Gains)
│   │   └── Sum Negative Differences (Losses)
│   ├── Smooth Gains and Losses
│   │   ├── Use 14-period Exponential Moving Average for Gains
│   │   └── Use 14-period Exponential Moving Average for Losses
│   └── Calculate RTSI
│       ├── Use Smoothed Gains
│       ├── Divide by sum of Smoothed Gains and Losses
│       └── Multiply by 100
├── Calculate Volume Momentum
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Calculate 20-day Moving Average of Volume
│   └── Subtract 20-day Moving Average from current Volume
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Multiply Price Range Ratio by RTSI
│   ├── Add the result to Volume Momentum
│   └── Multiply the combined result by Volume and Amount Adjusted Momentum Score
└── Interpret as Alpha Factor
    ├── High values indicate strong combined momentum and price action
    ├── Low values suggest weak or ambiguous combined signals
    └── Use as a predictor for future stock returns
