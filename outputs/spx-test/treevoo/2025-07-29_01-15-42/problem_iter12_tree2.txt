Integrating Volume, Amount, and Price Action with Enhanced Momentum and Volatility Signals
├── Calculate Daily Close-to-Close Return
│   ├── Use Close price
│   └── Compute difference between two consecutive days
├── Smooth with Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
│   ├── Determine EMA window length (e.g., 5 days, 10 days, etc.)
│   └── Apply EMA to the close-to-close returns
├── Adjust for Volume and Amount
│   ├── Summarize Volume over the EMA period
│   │   ├── Aggregate total volume of the last n days (same as EMA window length)
│   ├── Summarize Amount over the EMA period
│   │   ├── Aggregate total amount of the last n days (same as EMA window length)
│   └── Calculate Ratio of Momentum to Combined Volume and Amount
│       ├── Combine summarized volume and amount by summing them
│       └── Divide EMA smoothed return by the combined total
├── Calculate Daily Price Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Subtract Low price
├── Calculate Price Range Ratio
│   ├── Use Daily Price Range
│   └── Divide by Open price
├── Compute Relative True Strength Index (RTSI)
│   ├── Accumulate Gains and Losses
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   ├── Compare with Previous Close
│   │   ├── Sum Positive Differences (Gains)
│   │   └── Sum Negative Differences (Losses)
│   ├── Smooth Gains and Losses
│   │   ├── Use 14-period Exponential Moving Average for Gains
│   │   └── Use 14-period Exponential Moving Average for Losses
│   └── Calculate RTSI
│       ├── Use Smoothed Gains
│       ├── Divide by sum of Smoothed Gains and Losses
│       └── Multiply by 100
├── Calculate Daily Volatility
│   ├── Use High and Low prices
│   └── Compute standard deviation of daily returns over a specified period
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Multiply Price Range Ratio by RTSI
│   ├── Add the result to adjusted momentum score
│   ├── Multiply the combined result by Volume and Amount Adjusted Momentum Score
│   └── Incorporate Daily Volatility
│       ├── Normalize the combined result with the daily volatility
└── Interpret as Alpha Factor
    ├── High values indicate strong combined momentum and price action
    ├── Low values suggest weak or ambiguous combined signals
    └── Use as a predictor for future stock returns
