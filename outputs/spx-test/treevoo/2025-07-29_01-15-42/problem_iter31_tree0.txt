Thought: Develop price-based alpha factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate simple moving averages (SMA) for different periods
  - Sub-thought: Compute 5-day SMA
  - Sub-thought: Compute 10-day SMA
  - Sub-thought: Compute 20-day SMA
  - Sub-thought: Compute 50-day SMA
  - Sub-thought: Compute 100-day SMA
- Sub-thought: Derive momentum factors from SMAs
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between 5-day and 20-day SMA
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between 10-day and 50-day SMA
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between 20-day and 100-day SMA
- Sub-thought: Use high, low, and close prices to create volatility measures
  - Sub-thought: Calculate true range (TR)
    - Sub-thought: TR = max[(high - low), abs(high - previous close), abs(low - previous close)]
  - Sub-thought: Compute average true range (ATR) over a period
    - Sub-thought: Compute 14-day ATR
- Sub-thought: Create volume-related alpha factors
  - Sub-thought: Calculate on-balance volume (OBV)
    - Sub-thought: If close > previous close, OBV = previous OBV + current volume
    - Sub-thought: If close < previous close, OBV = previous OBV - current volume
    - Sub-thought: If close == previous close, OBV = previous OBV
  - Sub-thought: Compute volume weighted average price (VWAP)
    - Sub-thought: VWAP = cumulative (price * volume) / cumulative volume
- Sub-thought: Combine alpha factors to form composite indicators
  - Sub-thought: Create a composite factor using SMA differences and ATR
    - Sub-thought: Composite factor = (5-day SMA - 20-day SMA) / ATR
  - Sub-thought: Create a composite factor using OBV and VWAP
    - Sub-thought: Composite factor = (OBV / VWAP) * (close - VWAP)
