def heuristics_v2(df):
    """
    Generate a novel and interpretable alpha factor based on the given market features.
    
    The function computes an alpha factor that combines the interaction between the close price,
    the high-low price range, and the volume. It aims to capture the momentum and volatility in the
    stock price movement, along with the trading activity.
    
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with columns ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'] and
                       index as (date).
                       
    Returns:
    pd.Series: A pandas Series indexed by (date) representing the factor values.
