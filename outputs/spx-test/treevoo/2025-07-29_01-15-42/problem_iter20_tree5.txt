  Thought: Investigate Price Changes and Ranges for Momentum and Reversal Indicators
    Thought: Compute Daily Price Change
      Code: daily_price_change = close - open
    Thought: Calculate the 7-Day Average of Daily Price Changes
      Code: avg_7day_price_change = (daily_price_change.rolling(window=7).mean())
    Thought: Calculate the 21-Day Average of Daily Price Changes
      Code: avg_21day_price_change = (daily_price_change.rolling(window=21).mean())
    Thought: Combine Averages to Identify Long-Term Momentum
      Code: long_term_momentum = (avg_21day_price_change - avg_7day_price_change)
    Thought: Measure the Distance Between High and Low
      Code: high_low_range = high - low
    Thought: Calculate the 5-Day Average High-Low Range
      Code: avg_5day_high_low_range = (high_low_range.rolling(window=5).mean())
    Thought: Evaluate the Ratio of Today's Range to its 5-Day Average
      Code: reversal_signal = (high_low_range / avg_5day_high_low_range) - 1

  Thought: Analyze Volume-Adjusted Price Movements and Intraday Dynamics
    Thought: Compute Daily Return
      Code: daily_return = (close - open) / open
    Thought: Calculate the Moving Average Volume over 20 Days
      Code: moving_avg_volume = volume.rolling(window=20).mean()
    Thought: Calculate the Summarized Volume over 5 Days
      Code: summarized_volume = volume.rolling(window=5).sum()
    Thought: Generate Volume-Adjusted Price Range
      Code: volume_adjusted_price_range = high_low_range / moving_avg_volume
    Thought: Smooth Daily Return with a 5-Day Simple Moving Average
      Code: smoothed_daily_return = (close - close.shift(1)).pct_change().rolling(window=5).mean()
    Thought: Calculate Volume-Adjusted Momentum
      Code: volume_adjusted_momentum = smoothed_daily_return / summarized_volume
    Thought: Compute Intraday Return
      Code: intraday_return = (high - low) / close.shift(1)
    Thought: Compute Open-to-Close Return
      Code: open_to_close_return = (close - open) / open
    Thought: Combine Intraday and Open-to-Close Returns
      Code: combined_returns = 0.5 * intraday_return + 0.5 * open_to_close_return

  Thought: Calculate Daily Close-to-Close Return
    Code: daily_close_to_close_return = close.pct_change()

  Thought: Smooth Returns with EMA
    Thought: Set EMA window (e.g., 5 or 10 days)
    Code: ema_window = 10
    Thought: Apply EMA to close-to-close returns
    Code: ema_smoothed_return = daily_close_to_close_return.ewm(span=ema_window, adjust=False).mean()

  Thought: Adjust for Volume and Amount
    Thought: Summarize Volume over EMA period
    Code: summarized_ema_volume = volume.rolling(window=ema_window).sum()
    Thought: Summarize Amount over EMA period
    Code: summarized_ema_amount = amount.rolling(window=ema_window).sum()
    Thought: Calculate Adjusted Momentum
    Code: adjusted_momentum = ema_smoothed_return / (summarized_ema_volume + summarized_ema_amount)

  Thought: Calculate Relative True Strength Index (RTSI)
    Thought: Accumulate Gains and Losses
    Code: gains = (close - close.shift(1)).clip(lower=0)
    Code: losses = (close.shift(1) - close).clip(lower=0)
    Thought: Smooth Gains and Losses
    Code: smoothed_gains = gains.ewm(span=14, adjust=False).mean()
    Code: smoothed_losses = losses.ewm(span=14, adjust=False).mean()
    Thought: Calculate RTSI
    Code: rtsi = smoothed_gains / (smoothed_gains + smoothed_losses) * 100

  Thought: Calculate Intraday Volatility (ATR)
    Code: atr = (high - low).rolling(window=14).mean()

  Thought: Synthesize Factors for Predictive Power
    Thought: Create a Composite Score from Identified Signals
    Code: composite_score = (long_term_momentum + reversal_signal + volume_adjusted_momentum + adjusted_momentum + rtsi + atr) / 6
