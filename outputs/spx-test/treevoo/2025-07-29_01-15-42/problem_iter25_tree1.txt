Thought: Synthesize alpha factors from price, volume, and amount data to predict future stock returns
- Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price from one day to the next
  - Sub-thought: Use the percentage change as a simple momentum indicator
    - Sub-thought: Introduce a smoothing factor to the percentage change to reduce noise
- Sub-thought: Compare today's closing price with the moving average of the past n days
  - Sub-thought: If the current close is above the moving average, it may indicate a bullish trend
  - Sub-thought: If the current close is below the moving average, it may indicate a bearish trend
- Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the past n days
  - Sub-thought: High volume with a positive price change suggests buying pressure
  - Sub-thought: High volume with a negative price change suggests selling pressure
- Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between high-low range and closing price
  - Sub-thought: If the closing price is near the high of the day, it may indicate a bullish sentiment
  - Sub-thought: If the closing price is near the low of the day, it may indicate a bearish sentiment
- Sub-thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) over the past n days
  - Sub-thought: Combine ATR with the percentage change in closing price to create a volatility-adjusted momentum indicator
- Sub-thought: Extend Price-Volume Trend (PVT) to include the difference between the current day's PVT and its moving average
  - Sub-thought: Use the difference to identify potential divergences between price and volume
- Sub-thought: Investigate the trend of the amount by comparing it with its own moving average to signal buying or selling pressure
- Sub-thought: Create a composite score based on the above indicators
  - Sub-thought: Assign weights to each factor based on their predictive power
  - Sub-thought: Introduce a dynamic weighting system based on recent performance
- Sub-thought: Develop a momentum-based alpha factor that captures the direction and strength of the move from open to close
  - Sub-thought: Include the open-to-close change in the composite score to enhance intraday insights
