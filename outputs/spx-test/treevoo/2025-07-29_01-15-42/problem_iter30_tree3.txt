Thought: Constructing Momentum-based Alpha Factor
- Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices over the last 14 days.
  - Sub-thought: Subtract the SMA of the last 14 days from the current day's closing price to find the momentum.
- Sub-thought: Introduce a lookback period for smoothing the momentum
  - Sub-thought: Use a 28-day lookback period to smooth the momentum calculation by applying an exponential moving average (EMA) with a span of 28 on the raw momentum series.
- Sub-thought: Enhance the signal by incorporating relative strength
  - Sub-thought: Compute the relative strength as the ratio of the asset's close price to its lowest price over the last 52 weeks.
  - Sub-thought: Multiply the smoothed momentum by the relative strength to create a more robust alpha factor.
- Sub-thought: Incorporate volume into the alpha factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) over the last 30 days.
  - Sub-thought: Adjust the final alpha factor value by multiplying it with the VWAP, to account for the influence of trading volume on the market direction.
