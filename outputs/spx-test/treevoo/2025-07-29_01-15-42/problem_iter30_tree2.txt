Thought 1: Trend Following Factors
- Sub-thought 1.1: Exponential Moving Average Crossover
  - Sub-thought 1.1.1: Short-term exponential moving average (e.g., 5-day) and long-term exponential moving average (e.g., 20-day)
  - Calculation: 5-day EMA - 20-day EMA
- Sub-thought 1.2: Rate of Change (ROC)
  - Sub-thought 1.2.1: Percentage change over a period (e.g., 10 days)
  - Calculation: (Close(t) - Close(t-10)) / Close(t-10)

Thought 2: Volume-based Factors
- Sub-thought 2.1: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
  - Calculation: Sum of volume on up days minus sum of volume on down days
- Sub-thought 2.2: Volume Price Trend (VPT)
  - Calculation: VPT(t-1) + (Volume(t) * (Close(t) - Close(t-1)))

Thought 3: Volatility-based Factors
- Sub-thought 3.1: Bollinger Bands
  - Sub-thought 3.1.1: 20-day moving average and standard deviation
  - Calculation: (Close - 20-day MA) / (2 * 20-day STD)
- Sub-thought 3.2: Donchian Channels
  - Sub-thought 3.2.1: 20-day high and low
  - Calculation: (Close - 20-day Low) / (20-day High - 20-day Low)

Thought 4: Pattern Recognition Factors
- Sub-thought 4.1: Inside Bar
  - Calculation: High(t) < High(t-1) AND Low(t) > Low(t-1)
- Sub-thought 4.2: Pin Bar
  - Calculation: (High(t) - Low(t)) / (High(t) - Open(t)) OR (High(t) - Low(t)) / (Close(t) - Low(t))

Thought 5: Composite Factors
- Sub-thought 5.1: Combine Trend and Volume
  - Calculation: (Short-term EMA - Long-term EMA) * (5-day Avg Volume / 20-day Avg Volume)
- Sub-thought 5.2: Combine Volatility and Momentum
  - Calculation: (Bollinger Band Value) * (Rate of Change)
