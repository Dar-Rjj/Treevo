Thought: Begin by exploring the relationship between trading volume and price movements.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the average volume over the past 5 days.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Use this ratio as a factor that could indicate unusual activity or interest in the stock, potentially signaling future price movement.
- Sub-thought: Analyze the difference between today's close and the average closing price over the past 5 days.
  - Sub-sub-thought: This difference could act as a momentum indicator, suggesting if the stock is moving away from its recent trend.
- Sub-thought: Examine the high-low spread of the day.
  - Sub-sub-thought: A wider spread might suggest higher volatility for the day, which can be a signal for potential changes in the next period.
- Sub-thought: Investigate the open-close change.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Look into whether the stock closed higher or lower than it opened, as an immediate direction of price movement.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Consider the magnitude of this change, as larger deviations might indicate stronger directional sentiment.
- Sub-thought: Explore the relationship between the current day's range (high - low) and the previous day's range.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compare the ranges to identify any patterns, such as consecutive days with increasing or decreasing ranges, hinting at volatility trends.
- Sub-thought: Study the interaction between the current day's trading volume and price action.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Identify days where unusually high volume accompanies a large price move, either upward or downward, as a sign of strong market conviction.
  - Sub-sub-thought: Conversely, note instances of low volume despite significant price moves, possibly indicating weak support or resistance levels being tested.
