Integrated Volume, Amount, and Price Action Momentum Score with Enhanced Signals
├── Calculate EMA Smoothed Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Use Close price
│   ├── Subtract Open price of the next day
│   ├── Apply EMA (e.g., 10 days) to close-to-open returns
├── Adjust for Volume and Amount
│   ├── Aggregate total volume over EMA period
│   ├── Aggregate total amount over EMA period
│   └── Divide EMA smoothed return by sum of aggregated volume and amount
├── Calculate Price Range Ratio
│   ├── Use High price
│   ├── Subtract Low price
│   └── Divide by Close price
├── Compute RTSI
│   ├── Accumulate Gains and Losses
│   │   ├── Sum Positive Differences (Gains)
│   │   └── Sum Negative Differences (Losses)
│   ├── Smooth Gains and Losses
│   │   ├── Use 14-period EMA for Gains
│   │   └── Use 14-period EMA for Losses
│   └── Calculate RTSI
│       ├── Use Smoothed Gains
│       ├── Divide by sum of Smoothed Gains and Losses
│       └── Multiply by 100
├── Calculate EMA Smoothed Daily Volume Change
│   ├── Use Volume
│   ├── Compute difference between two consecutive days
│   ├── Apply EMA (e.g., 5 days) to daily volume change
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Multiply Price Range Ratio by RTSI
│   ├── Add result to adjusted momentum score
│   ├── Add result to EMA smoothed daily volume change
└── Interpret as Alpha Factor
    ├── High values indicate strong combined momentum and price action
    └── Low values suggest weak or ambiguous combined signals
