Integrated Price, Intraday Volatility, and Enhanced Volume-Amount Adjustments with Synthesized Volatility and Momentum
├── Calculate Combined Momentum
│   ├── Long-Term Momentum (Close price at t-28 to Close price at t)
│   └── Short-Term Momentum (Close price at t-7 to Close price at t)
├── Calculate Realized Volatility
│   ├── Use Close price over a rolling window of 10 days
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── High price
│   └── Low price
├── Calculate EMA Smoothed Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Close price
│   ├── Open price of the next day
│   └── Apply EMA (e.g., 10 days) to close-to-open returns
├── Adjust for Volume and Amount
│   ├── Aggregate total volume over EMA period (same as EMA window length)
│   ├── Aggregate total amount over EMA period (same as EMA window length)
│   └── Divide EMA smoothed return by sum of aggregated volume and amount
├── Calculate Daily Price Range
│   ├── High price
│   └── Subtract Low price
├── Calculate Price Range Ratio
│   ├── Use Daily Price Range
│   └── Divide by Close price
├── Compute Relative True Strength Index (RTSI)
│   ├── Accumulate Gains and Losses
│   │   ├── Sum Positive Differences (Gains)
│   │   └── Sum Negative Differences (Losses)
│   ├── Smooth Gains and Losses
│   │   ├── Use 14-period EMA for Gains
│   │   └── Use 14-period EMA for Losses
│   └── Calculate RTSI
│       ├── Use Smoothed Gains
│       ├── Divide by sum of Smoothed Gains and Losses
│       └── Multiply by 100
├── Weighted Average of Combined Components
│   ├── Assign Weights
│   │   ├── Combined Momentum (weight: 0.35)
│   │   ├── Intraday High-Low Spread (weight: 0.1)

│   └── Sum of Weighed Components
└── Final Factor
    ├── Multiply Weighted Average by Volume Acceleration
    │   ├── Volume at t-10
    │   └── Volume at t
    └── Adjust by Volume Change
        ├── Volume
        └── Compare with Previous Day's Volume
