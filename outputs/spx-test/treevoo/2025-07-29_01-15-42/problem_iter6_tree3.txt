Volume and Amount Adjusted Momentum Score with Additional Price Components
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   ├── Compute Close-to-Close Return
│   │   ├── Use Close price
│   │   └── Compute difference between two consecutive days
│   └── Smooth with Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│       ├── Determine SMA window length (e.g., 5 days, 10 days, etc.)
│       └── Apply SMA to the close-to-close returns
└── Adjust for Volume and Amount
    ├── Summarize Volume over the SMA period
    │   ├── Aggregate total volume of the last n days (same as SMA window length)
    └── Summarize Amount over the SMA period
        ├── Aggregate total amount of the last n days (same as SMA window length)
    └── Calculate Ratio of Momentum to Combined Volume and Amount
        ├── Combine summarized volume and amount by summing them
        ├── Divide SMA smoothed return by the combined total
        └── Output Volume and Amount Adjusted Momentum Score as the alpha factor
└── Incorporate High and Low Prices
    ├── Compute High-to-Low Range
    │   ├── Use High and Low prices
    │   └── Compute difference between high and low for each day
    └── Smooth with Simple Moving Average (SMA)
        ├── Determine SMA window length (e.g., 5 days, 10 days, etc.)
        └── Apply SMA to the high-to-low range
└── Adjust for Volume and Amount with High and Low Prices
    ├── Combine High-to-Low Range and Close-to-Close Return
    │   ├── Sum the SMA smoothed high-to-low range and close-to-close return
    └── Calculate Ratio of Combined Momentum to Combined Volume and Amount
        ├── Combine summarized volume and amount by summing them
        ├── Divide the combined momentum by the combined total
        └── Output Volume and Amount Adjusted Combined Momentum Score as the alpha factor
