```python

def heuristics_v2(df):
    """
    This function generates a novel alpha factor based on the given market data.
    It calculates the buying pressure by considering the difference between the close and low prices,
    and selling pressure by considering the difference between the high and close prices. 
    A ratio of buying to total (buying + selling) pressure is then used as the alpha factor, 
    which can indicate the dominance of buying or selling pressure in the market.

    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame with columns ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'] and index as (date).

    Returns:
    pd.Series: A pandas Series indexed by (date) representing the factor values.
