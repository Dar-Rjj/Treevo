Thought: Use basic price and volume data to create initial alpha factors
- Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change of the close price from the previous day
- Sub-thought: Analyze the spread between high and low prices as a measure of volatility
  - Sub-thought: Introduce a lagged term to evaluate the change in daily volatility over time
- Sub-thought: Consider the relationship between closing price and volume, such as Price-Volume Trend (PVT)
  - Sub-thought: Extend PVT to include the difference between the current day's PVT and its moving average
- Sub-thought: Explore patterns in the amount data related to transactions
  - Sub-thought: Investigate the trend of the amount by comparing it with its own moving average to signal buying or selling pressure
- Sub-thought: Combine multiple indicators to form a composite factor
  - Sub-thought: Create an alpha score based on the combination of the percentage change, PVT, and the amount trend
    - Sub-thought: Weight each component based on their historical predictive power for the stock returns
- Sub-thought: Incorporate intraday momentum by analyzing the difference between open and close prices
  - Sub-thought: Develop a momentum-based alpha factor that captures the direction and strength of the move from open to close
  - Sub-thought: Augment this factor with the relative position of the close price within the high-low range, indicating the day's finish in relation to its trading range
