Thought: Constructing Alpha Factors from OHLC Prices and Volume
- Sub-thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Price-based Momentum
    - Calculation: (Close_t - Close_(t-n))/Close_(t-n)
  - Sub-thought: Volume-based Momentum
    - Calculation: (Volume_t - Volume_(t-n))/Volume_(t-n)
- Sub-thought: Trend Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculation: SMA(Close, short_period) - SMA(Close, long_period)
  - Sub-thought: High-Low Range
    - Calculation: (High_t - Low_t)
- Sub-thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Sub-thought: True Range
    - Calculation: Max(High_t - Low_t, Abs(High_t - Close_(t-1)), Abs(Low_t - Close_(t-1)))
  - Sub-thought: Price Change Volatility
    - Calculation: StdDev(Close, n)
- Sub-thought: Relative Strength Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI) inspired
    - Calculation: (Mean of Positive Changes in Close over n periods / Mean of Absolute Changes in Close over n periods)
- Sub-thought: Money Flow Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Money Flow Index (MFI) inspired
    - Calculation: (Money_Flow_Ratio = Sum(Positive Money Flow) / Sum(Negative Money Flow), where Money Flow = Typical Price * Volume, and Positive/Negative is determined by the direction of the price change)
