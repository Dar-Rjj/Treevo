Generate novel and interpretable alpha factors for predicting stock returns
    Calculate momentum indicators
        Simple Moving Average (SMA) of close prices over 5, 10, 20, and 50 days
            SMA_5 = (Sum of close prices in the last 5 days) / 5
            SMA_10 = (Sum of close prices in the last 10 days) / 10
            SMA_20 = (Sum of close prices in the last 20 days) / 20
            SMA_50 = (Sum of close prices in the last 50 days) / 50
        Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of close prices over 5, 10, 20, and 50 days
            EMA_5 = (Close price of day t * 2 / (5 + 1)) + (EMA_5(t-1) * (1 - (2 / (5 + 1))))
            EMA_10 = (Close price of day t * 2 / (10 + 1)) + (EMA_10(t-1) * (1 - (2 / (10 + 1))))
            EMA_20 = (Close price of day t * 2 / (20 + 1)) + (EMA_20(t-1) * (1 - (2 / (20 + 1))))
            EMA_50 = (Close price of day t * 2 / (50 + 1)) + (EMA_50(t-1) * (1 - (2 / (50 + 1))))
        Rate of Change (ROC) of close prices over 5, 10, 20, and 50 days
            ROC_5 = (Close price of day t / Close price of day (t-5)) - 1
            ROC_10 = (Close price of day t / Close price of day (t-10)) - 1
            ROC_20 = (Close price of day t / Close price of day (t-20)) - 1
            ROC_50 = (Close price of day t / Close price of day (t-50)) - 1
    Analyze volatility and trend strength
        True Range (TR) calculation
            TR = Max[(High of day t - Low of day t), Abs(High of day t - Close of day (t-1)), Abs(Low of day t - Close of day (t-1))]
        Average True Range (ATR) over 14 days
            ATR_14 = (Previous ATR_14 * 13 + TR of day t) / 14
        Bollinger Bands
            Middle Band (MB) = SMA_20
            Upper Band (UB) = MB + 2 * Standard Deviation of close prices over the last 20 days
            Lower Band (LB) = MB - 2 * Standard Deviation of close prices over the last 20 days
    Measure market sentiment using volume
        On-Balance Volume (OBV)
            If (Close of day t > Close of day (t-1)), OBV = Previous OBV + Volume of day t
            If (Close of day t < Close of day (t-1)), OBV = Previous OBV - Volume of day t
            Otherwise, OBV = Previous OBV
        Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) over 20 days
            Money Flow Multiplier = [(Close of day t - Low of day t) - (High of day t - Close of day t)] / (High of day t - Low of day t)
            Money Flow Volume = Money Flow Multiplier * Volume of day t
            CMF_20 = Sum of Money Flow Volumes over the last 20 days / Sum of Volumes over the last 20 days
    Develop custom price patterns
        Inside Bar pattern
            An inside bar occurs when the High of day t is less than the High of day (t-1) and the Low of day t is greater than the Low of day (t-1)
        Bullish Engulfing pattern
            A bullish engulfing pattern occurs when the Close of day t is higher than the Open of day (t-1) and the Open of day t is lower than the Close of day (t-1)
        Bearish Engulfing pattern
            A bearish engulfing pattern occurs when the Close of day t is lower than the Open of day (t-1) and the Open of day t is higher than the Close of day (t-1)
