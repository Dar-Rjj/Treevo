Volume Adjusted Momentum Breakout
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   └── Compute difference between High and Low
├── Compute Average True Range
│   ├── Calculate True Range for each day using High, Low, and Close prices
│   └── Divide the sum of True Ranges by n (number of days)
├── Determine Volume Trend
│   ├── Compare sum of volume over the last m days with the previous m days
│   └── Determine if volume is increasing or decreasing
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract the average close price (last p days) from current close price
└── Combine Factors
    ├── Multiply High-Low Range by Average True Range
    ├── Adjust by Volume Trend (multiply by 1 if increasing, -1 if decreasing)
    └── Add Price Momentum to the result
