Thought: Exploring price and volume patterns for generating alpha factors
    Sub-thought: Analyzing return patterns
        Sub-thought: Simple returns
            Calculation: (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
        Sub-thought: Logarithmic returns
            Calculation: ln(Close_t / Close_(t-1))
        Sub-thought: Cumulative returns over N periods
            Calculation: (Close_t - Close_(t-N)) / Close_(t-N)
    Sub-thought: Momentum indicators
        Sub-thought: Simple moving average (SMA)
            Calculation: Average of Close over N periods
        Sub-thought: Exponential moving average (EMA)
            Calculation: EMA = (Close_t * 2 / (N + 1)) + (EMA_(t-1) * (1 - 2 / (N + 1)))
        Sub-thought: Rate of change (ROC)
            Calculation: (Close_t - Close_(t-n)) / Close_(t-n)
        Sub-thought: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
            Calculation: MACD Line = EMA(Close, 12) - EMA(Close, 26)
            Signal Line = EMA(MACD Line, 9)
    Sub-thought: Volatility measures
        Sub-thought: Daily range
            Calculation: High_t - Low_t
        Sub-thought: True range
            Calculation: Max(|High_t - Low_t|, |High_t - Close_(t-1)|, |Low_t - Close_(t-1)|)
        Sub-thought: Average true range (ATR)
            Calculation: SMA of True Range over N periods
        Sub-thought: Standard Deviation of returns
            Calculation: sqrt(Sum((Return_t - Mean(Return))^2) / (N - 1))
    Sub-thought: Volume indicators
        Sub-thought: On-balance volume (OBV)
            Calculation: If Close_t > Close_(t-1), OBV_t = OBV_(t-1) + Volume_t; If Close_t < Close_(t-1), OBV_t = OBV_(t-1) - Volume_t; else OBV_t = OBV_(t-1)
        Sub-thought: Chaikin money flow (CMF)
            Calculation: CMF = Sum((Close_t - Low_t) - (High_t - Close_t) * Volume_t / (High_t - Low_t)) / Sum(Volume_t) over N periods
        Sub-thought: Volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
            Calculation: VWAP = Sum(Close_t * Volume_t) / Sum(Volume_t) over N periods
    Sub-thought: Market sentiment analysis
        Sub-thought: Money flow index (MFI)
            Calculation: MFI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Positive Money Flow / Negative Money Flow)))
            Positive Money Flow: Sum of (Typical Price - Typical_(t-1)) * Volume_t when Typical Price > Typical_(t-1)
            Negative Money Flow: Sum of (Typical Price - Typical_(t-1)) * Volume_t when Typical Price < Typical_(t-1)
            Typical Price: (High_t + Low_t + Close_t) / 3
        Sub-thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
            Calculation: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Average Gain / Average Loss)))
            Average Gain: SMA of gains over N periods
            Average Loss: SMA of losses over N periods
