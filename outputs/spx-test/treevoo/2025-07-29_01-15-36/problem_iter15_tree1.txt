Alpha Mining Thought Tree
- Using Basic Price Information
  - Calculate daily return: (close[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1]
  - Calculate intraday return: (close[t] - open[t]) / open[t]
  - Calculate upper and lower shadow length: 
    - Upper Shadow: high[t] - max(open[t], close[t])
    - Lower Shadow: min(open[t], close[t]) - low[t]
- Utilizing Volume and Amount Data
  - Calculate volume change: volume[t] - volume[t-1]
  - Calculate amount change: amount[t] - amount[t-1]
  - Calculate average transaction size: amount[t] / volume[t]
- Combining Multiple Metrics for Enhanced Factors
  - Compute price momentum as the difference between today's close and the average of past n days' closing prices
  - Measure volatility as the standard deviation of daily returns over the past n days
  - Develop a factor that combines price momentum with relative volume increase, considering only positive daily returns
  - Create an alpha signal based on the ratio of the sum of positive to negative intraday returns over the past m days
- Incorporating Market Behavior Patterns
  - Identify days with exceptionally large moves defined by a threshold on the absolute value of daily return
  - Track the frequency of such large move days within a window of p days, creating a measure of market excitement or turbulence
  - Formulate a long-term trend indicator by analyzing the slope of the linear regression line of closing prices over the last q days
- Exploring Interactions Between Indicators
  - Integrate the direction of the daily return with the sign of the intraday return to understand the consistency of price movement during the day
  - Combine the long-term trend with short-term momentum changes to identify potential turning points in the market
  - Use the ratio of the upper shadow to the total candlestick length (high[t] - low[t]) as a measure of bearishness, and its inverse as a bullish signal
- Advanced Composite Factor Construction
  - Construct a composite score by weighting the above factors, with weights assigned based on their historical predictive power for stock returns
  - Experiment with different aggregation methods, such as taking the product, sum, or a more complex function of selected basic factors, focusing on enhancing the predictive capability
  - Develop a factor that ranks stocks based on a combination of recent performance, liquidity, and volatility, aiming to capture both growth and stability aspects
