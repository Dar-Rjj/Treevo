Performing Alpha Mining
- Novel and Interpretable Alpha Factors
  - Momentum-Based Factors
    - Price Trend Indicators
      - Calculate the difference between today's close and the n-day moving average of closes.
      - Calculate the percentage change in close price from t days ago to today.
    - Volume Trend Indicators
      - Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the n-day moving average of volumes.
      - Determine if today's volume is above or below the n-day moving average of volumes (binary output).
  - Reversal-Based Factors
    - Overbought/Oversold Indicators
      - Calculate the ratio of today's close to the n-day highest high.
      - Calculate the ratio of today's close to the n-day lowest low.
    - Price Extremes
      - Calculate the difference between today's close and the n-day maximum close.
      - Calculate the difference between today's close and the n-day minimum close.
  - Volatility-Based Factors
    - Historical Volatility
      - Calculate the standard deviation of the log returns over the past n days.
      - Calculate the average absolute daily return over the past n days.
    - Intraday Volatility
      - Calculate the range (high - low) for the current day.
      - Calculate the average range over the past n days.
  - Liquidity-Based Factors
    - Market Depth
      - Calculate the average value traded per share over the past n days.
      - Calculate the total value traded (close * volume) for the current day.
    - Turnover Rate
      - Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the n-day average volume.
      - Calculate the ratio of today's turnover (volume * close) to the n-day average turnover.
  - Technical Indicator-Based Factors
    - Moving Averages
      - Calculate the simple moving average of closes over the past n days.
      - Calculate the exponential moving average of closes over the past n days.
    - Bollinger Bands
      - Calculate the upper Bollinger Band (20-day moving average + 2 * standard deviation of last 20 days' close).
      - Calculate the lower Bollinger Band (20-day moving average - 2 * standard deviation of last 20 days' close).
    - MACD
      - Calculate the MACD line (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA).
      - Calculate the signal line (9-day EMA of the MACD line).
  - Event-Based Factors
    - Gaps
      - Calculate the difference between today's open and yesterday's close.
      - Identify if there was a gap up (open > yesterdays' close) or gap down (open < yesterdays' close).
    - Spikes
      - Calculate the ratio of today's volume to yesterday's volume.
      - Determine if today's volume is significantly higher than the n-day average volume.
  - Seasonality and Calendar-Based Factors
    - Day of the Week
      - Calculate the average return for each day of the week.
      - Identify if today's return is above or below the average return for the same day of the week.
    - Month of the Year
      - Calculate the average return for each month of the year.
      - Identify if today's return is above or below the average return for the same month of the year.
