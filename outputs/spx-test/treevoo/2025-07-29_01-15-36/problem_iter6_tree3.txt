Volume Adjusted Momentum Breakout with Enhanced Volatility and Momentum Integration
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   └── Compute difference between High and Low
├── Compute Average True Range
│   ├── Calculate True Range for each day using High, Low, and Close prices
│   └── Divide the sum of True Ranges by n (number of days)
├── Determine Volume Trend
│   ├── Compare sum of volume over the last m days with the previous m days
│   └── Determine if volume is increasing or decreasing
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract the average close price (last p days) from current close price
├── Enhance Volatility Measure
│   ├── Calculate Standard Deviation of Close Prices
│   │   └── Use the last q days to compute the standard deviation
│   └── Multiply the Standard Deviation by a volatility factor (e.g., 1.5)
├── Combine Factors
│   ├── Multiply High-Low Range by Average True Range
│   ├── Adjust by Volume Trend (multiply by 1 if increasing, -1 if decreasing)
│   └── Add Price Momentum to the result
└── Final Adjustment
    ├── Multiply the combined factors by the enhanced volatility measure
    └── Add a momentum adjustment factor based on the trend of the last r days' close prices
