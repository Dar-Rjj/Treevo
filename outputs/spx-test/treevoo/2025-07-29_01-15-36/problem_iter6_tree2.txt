Crossover of Intraday Momentum and Reversal with Volume Adjusted Momentum Breakout
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread and Range
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
│       └── Compute difference between High and Low
├── Calculate Open-to-Close Momentum
│   ├── Use Open price
│   └── Use Close price
│       └── Compute the difference between Close and Open
├── Determine Volume Trend
│   ├── Use Volume
│   │   ├── Sum volume over the last m days
│   │   └── Compare with sum of volume from the previous m days
│   └── Determine if volume is increasing or decreasing
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close prices
│   │   ├── Sum close prices over the last p days
│   │   └── Subtract the average close price from current close price
├── Combine Indicators
│   ├── Multiply Intraday High-Low Spread and Range by Open-to-Close Momentum
│   ├── Add the result to the Open-to-Close Momentum
│   └── Multiply the combined indicator by the Volume Trend (1 for increasing, -1 for decreasing)
└── Final Adjustment
    ├── Add Price Momentum to the combined indicator
    ├── Introduce a Weighted Average Factor
    │   ├── Use the last n days' close prices
    │   ├── Assign weights inversely proportional to their age
    │   └── Compute the weighted average
    └── Subtract the weighted average from the combined indicator
        └── Output as Alpha Factor
