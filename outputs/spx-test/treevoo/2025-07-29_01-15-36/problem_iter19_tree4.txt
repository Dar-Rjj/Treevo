Alpha Mining Thought Tree
- Using Basic Price Information
  - Daily return: (close[t] - close[t-1]) / close[t-1]
  - Intraday return: (close[t] - open[t]) / open[t]
  - Upper Shadow: high[t] - max(open[t], close[t])
  - Lower Shadow: min(open[t], close[t]) - low[t]
- Utilizing Volume and Amount Data
  - Volume change: volume[t] - volume[t-1]
  - Average transaction size: amount[t] / volume[t]
- Combining Multiple Metrics for Enhanced Factors
  - Price momentum: close[t] - mean(close[t-n:t])
  - Volatility: std(daily returns, n)
  - Combined factor: price momentum * (volume[t] / mean(volume[t-n:t])) (if daily return > 0)
  - Positive to negative intraday return ratio: sum(positive intraday returns, m) / sum(negative intraday returns, m)
- Incorporating Market Behavior Patterns
  - Large move days: |daily return| > threshold
  - Frequency of large moves: count(large move days, p)
  - Long-term trend: slope(linear regression, close[t-q:t])
- Exploring Interactions Between Indicators
  - Consistency of price movement: daily return sign * intraday return sign
  - Trend-momentum indicator: long-term trend * short-term momentum
  - Bearishness: upper shadow / (high[t] - low[t])
  - Bullishness: (high[t] - low[t]) / upper shadow
- Advanced Composite Factor Construction
  - Weighted composite score: weighted sum of selected factors
  - Aggregated factor: product or function of basic factors
  - Rank-based factor: combine recent performance, liquidity, and volatility
