Volume-Adjusted Momentum with Enhanced Breakout, RSI, and Exponential Weighting
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   └── Compute difference between High and Low
├── Compute Average True Range
│   ├── Calculate True Range for each day using High, Low, and Close prices
│   └── Divide the sum of True Ranges by n (number of days)
├── Determine Volume Trend
│   ├── Compare sum of volume over the last m days with the previous m days
│   └── Determine if volume is increasing or decreasing
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   └── Subtract the average close price (last p days) from current close price
├── Calculate N-Day Exponential Moving Average of Price Range
│   ├── Calculate Daily Price Range
│   │   └── High price - Low price
│   ├── Apply Exponential Weighting Factor to Daily Price Range
├── Calculate N-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI)
│   ├── Determine Upward and Downward Price Changes
│   │   ├── If today's close > yesterday's close, upward change = today's close - yesterday's close
│   │   └── If today's close < yesterday's close, downward change = yesterday's close - today's close
│   ├── Calculate Exponential Moving Average of Upward Change
│   │   ├── Apply Exponential Weighting Factor to Upward Price Changes over N days

│   └── Calculate RSI
│       ├── 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
├── Combine Factors
    ├── Multiply High-Low Range by Average True Range
