  - Sub-thought: Multiply High-Low Spread by Open-to-Close Momentum
  - Sub-thought: Add Open-to-Close Momentum
- Sub-thought: Calculate Close-to-Range Ratio.
  - Sub-thought: Divide Close by (High - Low)
- Sub-thought: Volume-Weighted Close-to-Range Momentum.
  - Sub-thought: Multiply Close-to-Range Ratio by Volume
- Sub-thought: Summarize Volume-Weighted Close-to-Range Momentum over a Window.
  - Sub-thought: Set Window Size (e.g., 5 days)
  - Sub-thought: Sum the Volume-Weighted Close-to-Range Momentum over the Window
- Sub-thought: Calculate N-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI).
  - Sub-thought: Upward Price Change: If today's close > yesterday's close, use today's close - yesterday's close
  - Sub-thought: Downward Price Change: If today's close < yesterday's close, use yesterday's close - today's close
  - Sub-thought: Exponential Moving Average of Upward Change
    - Sub-thought: Apply Exponential Weighting Factor to Sum of Upward Changes
  - Sub-thought: Exponential Moving Average of Downward Change
    - Sub-thought: Apply Exponential Weighting Factor to Sum of Downward Changes
  - Sub-thought: RS (Relative Strength): EMA(Upward Change) / |EMA(Downward Change)|
  - Sub-thought: RSI: 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
- Sub-thought: Combine the momentum indicator with the volume change and RSI to form a composite alpha factor.
  - Sub-thought: Multiply the momentum indicator by the percentage change in volume
  - Sub-thought: Adjust the composite alpha factor by adding the RSI value
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the performance of the composite alpha factor on historical data.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the correlation between the composite alpha factor and the next day's returns
  - Sub-thought: Assess the significance of the correlation to validate the factor's predictive power
- Sub-thought: Refine the composite alpha factor by incorporating additional price and volume information.
  - Sub-thought: Add the relative strength index (RSI) calculated from the close prices
    - Sub-thought: Define the RSI over a 14-day period
  - Sub-thought: Integrate the RSI into the composite alpha factor.

- Sub-thought: Explore further refinements by including high and low price data.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) to measure volatility.
    - Sub-thought: Define the ATR over a 14-day period
  - Sub-thought: Incorporate the ATR into the composite alpha factor.
    - Sub-thought: Adjust the composite alpha factor by dividing it by the ATR
  - Sub-thought: Finalize the evaluation of the enhanced composite alpha factor.
    - Sub-thought: Reassess the correlation with the next day's returns
    - Sub-thought: Ensure the factor remains robust and interpretable
- Sub-thought: Calculate Volume-Adjusted Momentum.
  - Sub-thought: N-Day EMA of Price Range * Volume
  - Sub-thought: N-Day RSI * Volume
  - Sub-thought: Combine: Volume-Adjusted EMA of Price Range + Volume-Adjusted RSI
