Thought: Identify Momentum Indicators as a Factor
- Thought: Calculate the difference between today's close and the previous day's close (Momentum)
  - Action: Subtract yesterday's close from today's close
- Thought: Calculate the rate of change over N days (RateOfChange)
  - Action: Divide the difference between today's close and the close N days ago by the close N days ago
- Thought: Determine the average gain or loss over N days (AverageGainLoss)
  - Action: Sum the gains or losses over the last N days and divide by N

Thought: Incorporate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as a Factor
- Thought: Calculate the typical price (TypicalPrice)
  - Action: Add high, low, and close prices and divide by 3
- Thought: Calculate the cumulative volume weighted typical price (CumulativeVWAP)
  - Action: Multiply the typical price by the volume for each day and sum these values
- Thought: Calculate the cumulative volume (CumulativeVolume)
  - Action: Sum the volume over the period of interest
- Thought: Compute VWAP
  - Action: Divide the cumulative volume weighted typical price by the cumulative volume

Thought: Analyze Price Volatility as a Factor
- Thought: Calculate the True Range (TR)
  - Thought: Calculate the maximum of (high - low), (high - previous close), (previous close - low)
    - Action: Find the highest value among the three differences
- Thought: Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) over N days
  - Action: Sum the true range values over the last N days and divide by N

Thought: Utilize Moving Averages as a Factor
- Thought: Calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) over N days
  - Action: Sum the closing prices over the last N days and divide by N
- Thought: Calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over N days
  - Action: Apply the EMA formula to the closing prices with a smoothing factor of 2 / (N + 1)

Thought: Combine Factors into a Composite Alpha Signal
- Thought: Integrate Momentum, RateOfChange, and ATR
  - Action: Sum the normalized Momentum, RateOfChange, and ATR values
- Thought: Integrate VWAP and SMAs
  - Action: Compare the current price to the VWAP and the SMA; if the current price is above both, it signals a buy, and if below both, it signals a sell
- Thought: Create a final composite alpha score
  - Action: Combine the integrated Momentum, RateOfChange, and ATR with the VWAP and SMA signals
