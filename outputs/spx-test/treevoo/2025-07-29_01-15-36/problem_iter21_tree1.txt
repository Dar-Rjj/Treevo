Thought: Constructing Alpha Factors from OHLC Prices and Volume
- Sub-thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Price-based Momentum
    - Calculation: (Close_t - Close_(t-n))/Close_(t-n)
  - Sub-thought: Volume-based Momentum
    - Calculation: (Volume_t - Volume_(t-n))/Volume_(t-n)
- Sub-thought: Trend Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Exponential Moving Average Crossover
    - Calculation: EMA(Close, short_period) - EMA(Close, long_period)
  - Sub-thought: High-Low Range
    - Calculation: (High_t - Low_t)
- Sub-thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Sub-thought: True Range
    - Calculation: Max(High_t - Low_t, Abs(High_t - Close_(t-1)), Abs(Low_t - Close_(t-1)))
  - Sub-thought: Price Change Variance
    - Calculation: Var(Close, n)
- Sub-thought: Relative Strength Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Modified Relative Strength Index (RSI) inspired
    - Calculation: (Sum of Positive Changes in Close over n periods / Sum of Absolute Changes in Close over n periods)
- Sub-thought: Money Flow Indicators
  - Sub-thought: Modified Money Flow Index (MFI) inspired
    - Calculation: (Money_Flow_Ratio = Sum(Positive Money Flow, n) / Sum(Abs(Money Flow), n), where Money Flow = Typical Price * Volume, and Positive/Negative is determined by the direction of the price change)
- Sub-thought: Volume-Weighted Price
  - Sub-thought: VWAP Inspired Factor
    - Calculation: CumSum(Close * Volume) / CumSum(Volume)
- Sub-thought: Market Sentiment
  - Sub-thought: Open-Close Spread
    - Calculation: Close_t - Open_t
  - Sub-thought: Gap Analysis
    - Calculation: (Open_t - Close_(t-1)) / Close_(t-1)
- Sub-thought: New Indicator: Price-to-Volume Ratio
  - Calculation: (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) / (Volume_t - Volume_(t-1))
- Sub-thought: New Indicator: Volume Weighted Price Change
  - Calculation: (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) * (Volume_t / Volume_(t-1))
