Thought: Develop a basic alpha factor using price and volume data.
- Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of close prices over a short and long period.
  - Sub-thought: Short-term SMA (5 days)
  - Sub-thought: Long-term SMA (20 days)
- Sub-thought: Determine the difference between the short-term and long-term SMA to create a momentum indicator.
- Sub-thought: Analyze the change in trading volume to identify significant buying or selling activity.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume from the previous day.
- Sub-thought: Combine the momentum indicator with the volume change to form a composite alpha factor.
  - Sub-thought: Multiply the momentum indicator by the percentage change in volume.
- Sub-thought: Evaluate the performance of the composite alpha factor on historical data.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the correlation between the composite alpha factor and the next day's returns.
  - Sub-thought: Assess the significance of the correlation to validate the factor's predictive power.
- Sub-thought: Refine the composite alpha factor by incorporating additional price and volume information.
  - Sub-thought: Add the relative strength index (RSI) calculated from the close prices.
    - Sub-thought: Define the RSI over a 14-day period.
  - Sub-thought: Integrate the RSI into the composite alpha factor.
    - Sub-thought: Adjust the composite alpha factor by adding the RSI value.
  - Sub-thought: Re-evaluate the refined composite alpha factor for predictive accuracy.
    - Sub-thought: Recalculate the correlation with the next day's returns.
    - Sub-thought: Validate the factor's consistency across different market conditions.
- Sub-thought: Explore further refinements by including high and low price data.
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the average true range (ATR) to measure volatility.
    - Sub-thought: Define the ATR over a 14-day period.
  - Sub-thought: Incorporate the ATR into the composite alpha factor.
    - Sub-thought: Adjust the composite alpha factor by dividing it by the ATR.
  - Sub-thought: Finalize the evaluation of the enhanced composite alpha factor.
    - Sub-thought: Reassess the correlation with the next day's returns.
    - Sub-thought: Ensure the factor remains robust and interpretable.
