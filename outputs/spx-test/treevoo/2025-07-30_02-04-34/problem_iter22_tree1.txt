|  |- [Volume Momentum]
|     |- Calculate the rate of change (ROC) of the volume compared to 20 days ago.
|
|- [Volatility Factors]
|  |- [Price Volatility]
|  |  |- Calculate the true range (TR) as max(high - low, abs(high - previous_close), abs(low - previous_close)).
|  |  |- Calculate the average true range (ATR) over a 14-day period.
|  |- [Volume Volatility]
|     |- Calculate the standard deviation of the daily volume changes over a 14-day period.
|
|- [Trend Strength Factors]
|  |- [Average Directional Index (ADX)]
|  |  |- Calculate +DM and -DM using the differences in highs and lows.
|  |  |- Calculate +DI and -DI from smoothed +DM and -DM values.
|  |  |- Calculate DX from +DI and -DI.
|  |  |- Calculate ADX as the 14-day EMA of DX.
|  |- [Commodity Channel Index (CCI)]
|     |- Calculate the typical price (TP) as (high + low + close) / 3.
|     |- Calculate the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of TP.
|     |- Calculate the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of TP over 20 days.
|     |- Calculate CCI as (TP - SMA(20)) / (0.015 * MAD).
|
|- [Market Sentiment Factors]
|  |- [Relative Strength Line (RSL)]
|  |  |- Calculate RSL as the ratio of the current close price to the average close price over the last 252 trading days.
|  |- [Money Flow Index (MFI)]
|     |- Calculate the typical price (TP) as (high + low + close) / 3.
|     |- Determine the money flow (MF) for each day as TP multiplied by the day's volume.
|     |- Calculate positive and negative money flow over a 14-day period.
|     |- Calculate MFI as 100 - (100 / (1 + (positive money flow / negative money flow))).
|
|- [Liquidity Factors]
