Crossover Intraday and Price Momentum with Integrated Volume and Close Price Trends
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Intraday Return
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
│   └── Divide by Open price
├── Calculate Raw Momentum
    ├── Use Close prices of the last 5 days
    └── Calculate the difference between current and previous close
├── Adjust Raw Momentum
    ├── If a volume spike, dampen raw momentum (use multiplier < 1)
    └── If not a volume spike, use raw momentum
├── Calculate Weighted Price Movement
    ├── Use (Close - Open) * Volume as a measure of money flow
└── Integrate Volume Impact
    ├── Calculate Average of Last 5 Days Volume
    │   └── Sum Last 5 Days Volume and Divide by 5
    ├── Multiply Intraday High-Low Spread by Current Day Volume
    │   └── Divide by 5-Day Average Volume
├── Detect Volume Spikes
    ├── Compare with previous day's volume
    ├── Identify Spike
    │   ├── If volume change is greater than 1.5 times average volume change
    │   └── Keep a rolling window of the last 20 days for average computation
├── Combine Intraday Factors
    ├── Add Intraday High-Low Spread
    └── Add Close-Open Spread
├── Initial Alpha Signal
    ├── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Combined Intraday Factors
    ├── Multiply by Weighted Price Movement
    └── Store as Initial Alpha Signal
├── Compute Smoothed Price Momentum
    ├── Sum Daily Price Change over past 5 days
    └── Divide by 5
├── Compute Weighted Volume Indicator
    ├── Multiply Volume Change of day t by its sign (positive or negative)
    └── Average over the past 5 days
├── Incorporate Close Price Trend
    ├── Calculate Close Price Change
    │   ├── Use Close price
    │   └── Compare with previous day's close price
    ├── Smooth Close Price Change
    │   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    │   │   ├── Set span to 5
    │   │   └── Exclude latest value for no look-ahead bias
    │   └── Calculate Difference between actual and smoothed close price change
├── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply Initial Alpha Signal by Smoothed Price Momentum
    ├── Multiply by Weighted Volume Indicator
    ├── Multiply by Close Price Trend
    └── Adjust for Volatility
        ├── Calculate Standard Deviation of Close Prices (last 10 days)
        └── Divide Final Alpha by 1 + (Standard Deviation)
