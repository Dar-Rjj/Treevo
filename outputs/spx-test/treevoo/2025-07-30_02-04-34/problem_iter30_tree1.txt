Thought: Develop Alpha Factors Using Price and Volume Data
- Thought: Trend Following Indicators
  - Thought: Moving Average Crossover
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Short-term (e.g., 5 days) and Long-term (e.g., 20 days) moving averages of the close prices. Factor = Short-term MA - Long-term MA.
  - Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate EMA using short-term and long-term periods on close prices. Factor = Short-term EMA - Long-term EMA.
- Thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Thought: Price Return Over Period
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the return from t-n to t, where n could be 1, 5, 10, or 20 days. Factor = (Close price at t / Close price at t-n) - 1.
  - Thought: Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Sub-Thought: Measure the rate of change in the closing price over a period (e.g., 12 days). Factor = (Close price at t / Close price at t-12) - 1.
- Thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Thought: Bollinger Bands Width
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate the upper and lower Bollinger Bands (typically 2 standard deviations from a 20-day moving average), then compute the width as a percentage of the moving average. Factor = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band.
  - Thought: True Range
    - Sub-Thought: For each day, true range is the maximum of the current high less the current low, the absolute value of the current high less the previous close, and the absolute value of the current low less the previous close. Factor = Sum of true ranges over n days.
- Thought: Volume Indicators
  - Thought: On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - Sub-Thought: OBV is a cumulative total volume that adjusts based on whether the security closed higher or lower than the previous close. Factor = Cumulative sum of ((Close > Previous Close ? Volume : -Volume) + OBV_t-1).
  - Thought: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Sub-Thought: VWAP is the ratio of the sum of the products of the price and volume for each transaction to the total volume. Factor = (Sum of (Price * Volume) / Sum of Volume) over a defined period.
- Thought: Sentiment Indicators
  - Thought: Positive vs Negative Volume Index
    - Sub-Thought: If the close is higher than the previous close, add the difference between today's and yesterday's volume to a positive index; if lower, add it to a negative index. Factor = Positive Index - Negative Index.
  - Thought: High-Low Ratio
    - Sub-Thought: Compute the ratio of the number of days with a new high over a specific period to the number of days with a new low. Factor = (Count of new highs / Count of new lows) over n days.
- Thought: Reversal Patterns
  - Thought: Inside Day Pattern
    - Sub-Thought: Identify an inside day pattern by checking if both the high and low of the current day are within the range of the previous day. If so, calculate the difference between the open and close prices. Factor = Open - Close on inside day.
  - Thought: Outside Day Pattern
    - Sub-Thought: Recognize an outside day by verifying if the high of the current day is above the high of the previous day and the low is below the low of the previous day. If found, measure the gap between the open and close. Factor = Close - Open on outside day.
