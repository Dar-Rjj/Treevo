|- [Momentum Factors]
|  |- [Price Momentum]
|  |  |- Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the close price over a 10-day period.
|  |  |- Calculate the rate of change (ROC) of the SMA(10) compared to 20 days ago.
|  |- [Volume Momentum]
|     |- Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the volume over a 10-day period.
|     |- Calculate the rate of change (ROC) of the SMA(10) of volume compared to 20 days ago.
|
|- [Volatility Factors]
|  |- [Price Volatility]
|  |  |- Calculate the true range (TR) as max(high - low, abs(high - previous_close), abs(low - previous_close)).
|  |  |- Calculate the average true range (ATR) over a 14-day period.
|  |- [Volume Volatility]
|     |- Calculate the daily volume change as (volume - previous_volume).
|     |- Calculate the standard deviation of the daily volume changes over a 14-day period.
|
|- [Trend Strength Factors]
|  |- [Average Directional Index (ADX)]
|  |  |- Calculate the difference between today's high and the previous day's high, and today's low and the previous day's low.
|  |  |- Calculate the +DM and -DM values using the differences in highs and lows.
|  |  |- Calculate the +DI and -DI from the smoothed +DM and -DM values.
|  |  |- Calculate the DX from +DI and -DI.
|  |  |- Calculate the ADX as the 14-day EMA of DX.
|  |- [Commodity Channel Index (CCI)]
|     |- Calculate the typical price (TP) as (high + low + close) / 3.
|     |- Calculate the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of TP.
|     |- Calculate the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of TP over 20 days.
|     |- Calculate the CCI as (TP - SMA(20)) / (0.015 * MAD).
|
|- [Market Sentiment Factors]
|  |- [Relative Strength Line (RSL)]
|  |  |- Calculate the RSL as the ratio of the current close price to the average close price over the last 252 trading days.
|  |- [Money Flow Index (MFI)]
|     |- Calculate the typical price (TP) as (high + low + close) / 3.
|     |- Determine the money flow (MF) for each day as TP multiplied by the day's volume.
|     |- Calculate positive and negative money flow over a 14-day period.
|     |- Calculate the MFI as 100 - (100 / (1 + (positive money flow / negative money flow))).
|
|- [Liquidity Factors]
   |- [Volume Turnover Ratio]
   |  |- Calculate the volume turnover ratio as the ratio of the current volume to the average volume over the last 20 days.
   |- [Dollar Volume]
      |- Calculate the dollar volume as the product of the close price and the volume.
