Volume and Price Momentum with Enhanced Indicators Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Daily Logarithmic Price Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Subtract with Close price of day (t-1)
│   └── Compute natural logarithm of the result
├── Calculate Volume Change Rate
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Divide by Volume of day (t-1)
│   └── Subtract 1 from the result
├── Compute Smoothed Logarithmic Price Momentum
│   ├── Sum Daily Logarithmic Price Return over past 7 days
│   └── Divide by 7
├── Compute Exponential Weighted Volume Indicator
│   ├── Multiply Volume Change Rate of day t by its sign (positive or negative)
│   └── Apply exponential smoothing with a factor of 0.5 over the past 7 days
└── Combine Enhanced Indicators
    ├── Multiply Smoothed Logarithmic Price Momentum by Exponential Weighted Volume Indicator
    ├── Add result to a baseline signal, set initially to 0
    └── Use this combined value as the final alpha factor for day t
