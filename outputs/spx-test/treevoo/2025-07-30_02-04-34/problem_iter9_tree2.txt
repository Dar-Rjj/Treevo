Momentum Adjusted by Intraday Factors and Volume Spikes with Enhanced Weighting
├── Calculate Raw Momentum
│   ├── Use Close prices of the last n days
│   └── Calculate the difference between current and previous close
├── Identify Volume Spike
│   ├── Compare current day volume with moving average of volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume of the last m days
│   │   └── Calculate the moving average
│   └── Determine if today's volume is a spike (above some threshold)
├── Adjust Momentum by Volume Spike
│   ├── If a volume spike, dampen the raw momentum
│   │   ├── Use a multiplier less than 1 on the raw momentum
│   └── If not a volume spike, use raw momentum
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread Factor
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Combine Intraday High-Low Spread Factor and Close-to-Open Return
│   ├── Add Intraday High-Low Spread Factor
│   └── Add Close-to-Open Return
├── Calculate Weighted Price Movement
│   ├── Use (Close - Open) * Volume as a measure of money flow
│   └── Divide Weighted Price Movement by Average Volume
│       └── Sum of Past 5 Days Volume / 5 to get Average Volume
├── Calculate Enhanced Weighted Price Movement
│   ├── Use (Close - Open) * Volume * (High - Low) as an enhanced measure
│   └── Divide Enhanced Weighted Price Movement by Average Volume
│       └── Sum of Past 5 Days Volume / 5 to get Average Volume
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Combined Intraday Factor
    ├── Multiply by Enhanced Weighted Price Movement
    └── Adjust for Volatility
        ├── Calculate Standard Deviation of Close Prices
        │   ├── Take the last 10 days close prices
        └── Divide Final Alpha by 1 + (Standard Deviation)
