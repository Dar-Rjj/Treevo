Thought: Develop a set of novel and interpretable alpha factors using (open, high, low, close) prices, amount, and volume.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate price momentum indicators that capture the trend of stock prices over different time windows.
        Sub-Thought: Compute the 7-day and 21-day simple moving averages (SMA) for the closing prices.
            Sub-Thought: Create an alpha factor as the difference between the 7-day SMA and the 21-day SMA.
        Sub-Thought: Define a 30-day price return as the percentage change in the closing price from 30 days ago.
            Sub-Thought: Use the 30-day price return as a standalone alpha factor.
        Sub-Thought: Construct a 14-day average direction index (ADX) using high and low prices to measure trend strength.
            Sub-Thought: Employ the 14-day ADX as an alpha factor.
    Sub-Thought: Incorporate volume-related features to reflect market sentiment and liquidity conditions.
        Sub-Thought: Formulate a 10-day average daily trading volume.
            Sub-Thought: Develop an alpha factor as the ratio of the current day's volume to the 10-day average daily trading volume.
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the 10-day cumulative volume delta, which is the sum of the differences between up-volume and down-volume over the last 10 days.
            Sub-Thought: Utilize the 10-day cumulative volume delta as an additional alpha factor.
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the 5-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the volume.
            Sub-Thought: Develop an alpha factor as the ratio of the current day's volume to the 5-day EMA of the volume.
    Sub-Thought: Combine price and volume data to create composite factors indicating potential market inefficiencies.
        Sub-Thought: Generate a 10-day money flow index (MFI) by considering typical price and raw volume.
            Sub-Thought: Introduce the 10-day MFI as an alpha factor.
        Sub-Thought: Measure the 10-day accumulation/distribution line (A/D Line) to assess the buying and selling pressure.
            Sub-Thought: Adopt the 10-day A/D Line change as an interpretative alpha factor.
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the 10-day Chaikin Oscillator, which is the difference between the 3-day EMA of the A/D Line and the 10-day EMA of the A/D Line.
            Sub-Thought: Introduce the 10-day Chaikin Oscillator as an alpha factor.
    Sub-Thought: Investigate intra-day trading patterns through the analysis of opening and closing prices.
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the 10-day average of the difference between open and close prices.
            Sub-Thought: Propose this average difference as an alpha factor to capture intra-day reversals.
        Sub-Thought: Determine the 10-day relative strength (RS) of the close price compared to the open price.
            Sub-Thought: Present the 10-day RS as an indicator of overnight price action strength.
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the 10-day average true range (ATR) using the high, low, and close prices.
            Sub-Thought: Use the 10-day ATR as an alpha factor to measure market volatility.
