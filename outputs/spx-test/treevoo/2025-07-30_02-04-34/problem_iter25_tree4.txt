Crossover of Intraday Momentum, Volume Analysis, and Their Synthesis with Enhanced Features
├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Close-Open Spread
│   ├── Subtract Open from Close
├── Calculate Smoothed Intraday Return
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
│   ├── Divide by Close price
│   ├── Apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with span 5
│   └── Exclude latest value for no look-ahead bias
├── Incorporate Volume Intensity
│   ├── Calculate Average Volume over last 10 periods
│   │   ├── Sum Volume over 10 days
│   │   └── Divide by 10
│   └── Multiply Intraday Momentum Difference by Inverse of Average Volume
├── Detect Volume Spikes
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change compared to previous day
│   ├── Identify Spike if volume change > 3 * average volume change
│   └── Keep a rolling window of the last 20 days for average computation
├── Combine Intraday Momentum and Volume Impact
│   ├── Multiply Intraday Momentum Difference by Volume Spike
│   ├── Smooth the combined factor using simple moving average with window 4
│   └── Exclude the most recent value to prevent future data leakage
├── Analyze Price and Volume Relationship
│   ├── Calculate Price Change compared to previous day
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change compared to previous day
│   ├── Identify Divergence if price change and volume change have opposite signs
│   └── Keep a rolling window of the last 10 days for divergence computation
└── Final Alpha Signal
    ├── Sum the results
    ├── Apply a threshold to filter out small signals
    └── Adjust the final signal based on identified divergences
