- Analyze historical price data to identify patterns that may predict future stock returns
  - Calculate moving averages to identify trends
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA) of closing prices over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 days)
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of closing prices for the same periods
  - Identify momentum indicators
    - Calculate Rate of Change (RoC) using closing prices to measure momentum
    - Compute the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to gauge overbought or oversold conditions
  - Use volume data to confirm price trends
    - Compare daily volume with a moving average of volume (e.g., 20-day MA of volume)
  - Incorporate high and low prices into volatility measures
    - Calculate Average True Range (ATR) to measure market volatility
    - Bollinger Bands: plot standard deviations away from a SMA of closing prices
  - Develop proprietary factors
    - Create a factor combining SMA and EMA crossovers
