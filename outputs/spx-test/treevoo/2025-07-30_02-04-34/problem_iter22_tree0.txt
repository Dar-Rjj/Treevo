Thought: Explore basic price patterns to identify potential alpha factors
  Sub-thought: Calculate simple moving averages (SMA) to capture trend information
    Sub-thought: Use SMA of closing prices over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20 days)
      Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between short-term and long-term SMA for trend direction
  Sub-thought: Analyze price momentum and volatility
    Sub-thought: Calculate daily return by using close price
      Sub-thought: Compute the average daily return over a fixed period (e.g., 5, 10 days)
    Sub-thought: Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns over a fixed period (e.g., 5, 10 days) for volatility
  Sub-thought: Identify patterns in volume and trading activity
    Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume over a fixed period (e.g., 5, 10 days)
    Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between volume changes and price changes
      Sub-thought: Calculate the correlation between daily volume and daily return
  Sub-thought: Explore high and low price patterns
    Sub-thought: Calculate the range (high - low) and analyze its trends
      Sub-thought: Compute the average range over a fixed period (e.g., 5, 10 days)
    Sub-thought: Calculate the relative position of the closing price within the high-low range
      Sub-thought: Use the formula (close - low) / (high - low) to determine the relative position
  Sub-thought: Examine the interaction between price and volume
    Sub-thought: Calculate the amount (volume * close) and analyze its trends
      Sub-thought: Compute the average amount over a fixed period (e.g., 5, 10 days)
    Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between the amount and the price
      Sub-thought: Calculate the correlation between the amount and the close price
  Sub-thought: Combine multiple factors to create composite indicators
    Sub-thought: Create a composite factor by combining SMA, volume, and momentum
      Sub-thought: Weigh each component based on historical performance and significance
