Thought: Crossover Integrated Alpha Factors from Momentum, Volume, and Intraday Analysis
    Thought: Combined Momentum-Based Factor
        Action: Calculate short-term momentum as (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5]
        Action: Calculate long-term momentum as (close[t] - close[t-20]) / close[t-20]
        Action: Subtract long-term momentum from short-term momentum to get momentum difference
        Action: Calculate raw momentum as sum of daily price change (close[t] - close[t-1]) over past 5 days divided by 5
        Action: Smoothed price momentum as the sum of daily price changes over past 5 days divided by 5
    Thought: Volume-Adjusted Momentum and Spike Detection
        Action: Calculate volume change as (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
        Action: Calculate average volume over the last 5 days as Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5
        Action: Divide volume change by average volume to get volume change factor
        Action: Identify a volume spike if (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) > 2 * average volume change, use rolling window of last 20 days for average
        Action: If a volume spike, dampen the raw momentum by multiplying it with a multiplier less than 1
        Action: If not a volume spike, use the raw momentum
    Thought: Price Action and Intraday Analysis
        Action: Use high[t] - low[t] as the daily range
        Action: Use close[t] - open[t] as the daily spread
        Action: Divide open-close spread by high-low range to get price action factor
        Action: Calculate intraday high-low spread as high[t] - low[t]
        Action: Calculate intraday return as (high[t] - low[t]) / close[t], apply EMA with span 5, exclude latest value
        Action: Multiply smoothed intraday return by inverse of average volume
        Action: Multiply intraday return by volume spike, smooth using SMA with window 4, exclude most recent value
        Action: Use next day's open price, subtract from current day's close price
    Thought: Dynamic Volume Intensity and Median Volume
        Action: Calculate dynamic volume weight by dividing each day's volume by the median volume over the last 5 periods
        Action: Take the median of these ratios to get the dynamic volume weight
        Action: Multiply intraday momentum difference by dynamic volume weight
    Thought: Composite Alpha Factor
        Action: Combine adjusted smoothed price momentum, volume-adjusted momentum, price action factor, and intraday momentum and volume impact
        Action: Assign weights to each factor (e.g., 0.3 * smoothed price momentum + 0.2 * volume-adjusted momentum + 0.1 * price action factor + 0.4 * intraday momentum and volume impact)
        Action: Add result to combined intraday momentum and volume impact
        Action: Output the final alpha factor
