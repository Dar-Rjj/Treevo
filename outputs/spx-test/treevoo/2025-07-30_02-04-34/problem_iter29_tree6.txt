Thought: Synthesize Advanced Alpha Factors from Price, Volume, and Intraday Patterns
    Thought: Momentum-Based Factor
        Action: Calculate Short-Term Momentum (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5]
        Action: Calculate Long-Term Momentum (close[t] - close[t-20]) / close[t-20]
        Action: Subtract long-term momentum from short-term momentum to get momentum difference
    Thought: Volume and Price Change Analysis
        Action: Calculate the difference between today's volume and the average volume over the past 30 days as an indication of unusual volume
        Action: Use (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) as the change in volume
        Action: Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5 as the average volume over the last 5 days
        Action: Use (volume[t] / volume[t-1]) as the volume ratio
        Action: Multiply volume change by volume ratio to get enhanced volume change
        Action: Sum of signed power (power=2) of the last 5 close prices minus the open price to detect strength or weakness in the trend
    Thought: Enhanced Price Action Factor
        Action: Use high[t] - low[t] as the daily range
        Action: Use close[t] - open[t] as the daily spread
        Action: Use high[t] - close[t] as the high-close spread
        Action: Divide open-close spread by high-low range, then subtract the high-close spread from it to get price action factor
        Action: Combine the daily high-low range with the absolute value of today’s return (close - open) to form a combined indicator of market action
    Thought: Intraday Analysis
        Action: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread (high[t] - low[t])
        Action: Calculate Close-Open Spread (close[t] - open[t])
        Action: Calculate Smoothed Intraday Return ((high[t] - low[t]) / close[t]) and apply EMA with span 5, exclude latest value
        Action: Calculate Average Volume over last 5 periods (Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5)
        Action: Multiply Intraday Momentum Difference by Inverse of Average Volume
        Action: Calculate Volume Change compared to previous day
        Action: Identify Spike if volume change > 1.75 * average volume change (keep a rolling window of the last 25 days for average computation)
        Action: Multiply Intraday Momentum Difference by Volume Spike
        Action: Smooth the combined factor using simple moving average with window 4, exclude the most recent value
    Thought: Composite Factor
        Action: Add momentum difference, enhanced volume change, and price action factor
        Action: Assign weights to each factor (e.g., 0.4 * momentum difference + 0.3 * enhanced volume change + 0.3 * price action factor)
        Action: Adjust weights based on recent performance of each individual factor
    Thought: Final Alpha Signal
        Action: Multiply Adjusted Price Momentum by Smoothed Price Momentum
        Action: Multiply result by Weighted Volume Indicator
        Action: Add result to Combined Intraday Momentum and Volume Impact
        Sub-action: Output the final alpha factor
