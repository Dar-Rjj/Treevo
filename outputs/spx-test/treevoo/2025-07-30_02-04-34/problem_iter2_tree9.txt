Integrated Price and Volume Momentum Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Daily Price Change
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Subtract with Close price of day (t-1)
├── Calculate Smoothed Price Momentum
│   ├── Sum Daily Price Change over past 5 days
│   └── Divide by 5
├── Compute Volume Weight
│   ├── Use Volume for each day from t-1 to t-n (n days)
│   ├── Compute the Average Volume
│   │   ├── Sum of Volumes from t-1 to t-n
│   │   └── Divide by n
│   └── Normalize Volume
│       ├── Divide each day's volume by the Average Volume
│       └── Take the average of normalized volumes
├── Combine Smoothed Price Momentum and Volume Weight
│   ├── Multiply Smoothed Price Momentum by Volume Weight
│   └── This result is used as the base momentum signal
├── Calculate Volume Change
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Subtract with Volume of day (t-1)
├── Compute Weighted Volume Indicator
│   ├── Multiply Volume Change of day t by its sign (positive or negative)
│   └── Average over the past 5 days
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Add the base momentum signal to the Weighted Volume Indicator
    └── Use this combined value as the final alpha factor for day t
