Thought: Synthesized Alpha Factors from Price, Volume, and Intraday Momentum with Enhanced Integration
    Thought: Momentum-Based Factor
        Thought: Calculate Short-Term Momentum
            Action: Use (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5] as short-term momentum
        Thought: Calculate Long-Term Momentum
            Action: Use (close[t] - close[t-20]) / close[t-20] as long-term momentum
        Thought: Combine Momentum Indicators
            Action: Subtract long-term momentum from short-term momentum to get momentum difference
    Thought: Volume-Based Factor
        Thought: Calculate Volume Change
            Action: Use (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) as the change in volume
        Thought: Calculate Average Volume
            Action: Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5 as the average volume over the last 5 days
        Thought: Combine Volume Indicators
            Action: Divide volume change by average volume to get volume change factor
    Thought: Price Action Factor
        Thought: Calculate High-Low Range
            Action: Use high[t] - low[t] as the daily range
        Thought: Calculate Open-Close Spread
            Action: Use close[t] - open[t] as the daily spread
        Thought: Combine Range and Spread
            Action: Divide open-close spread by high-low range to get price action factor
    Thought: Intraday Analysis
        Thought: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
            Action: Use high[t] - low[t]
        Thought: Calculate Close-Open Spread
            Action: Use close[t] - open[t]
        Thought: Calculate Smoothed Intraday Return
            Action: (high[t] - low[t]) / open[t], apply EMA with span 5, exclude latest value
        Thought: Incorporate Volume Intensity
            Action: Multiply smoothed intraday return by inverse of average volume
        Thought: Detect Volume Spikes
            Action: Calculate volume change compared to previous day, identify spike if > 1.75 * average volume change, use rolling window of last 25 days for average
        Thought: Combine Intraday Momentum and Volume Impact
            Action: Multiply smoothed intraday return by volume spike, smooth using SMA with window 4, exclude most recent value
        Thought: Integrate Next Day Open to Current Day Close
            Action: Use next day's open price, subtract from current day's close price
    Thought: Moving Averages
        Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA)
            Action: Calculate SMA of closing prices over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 days)
        Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
            Action: Calculate EMA of closing prices for the same periods
        Thought: SMACD (SMA Convergence Divergence)
            Action: Subtract SMA over a longer period from SMA over a shorter period
    Thought: Composite Factor
        Thought: Combine All Factors
            Action: Add momentum difference, volume change factor, price action factor, and intraday momentum and volume impact
        Thought: Weighted Combination
            Action: Assign weights to each factor (e.g., 0.4 * momentum difference + 0.3 * volume change factor + 0.1 * price action factor + 0.2 * intraday momentum and volume impact)
        Thought: Proprietary Factors
            Thought: SMA and EMA Crossover
                Action: Create a factor combining SMA and EMA crossovers
            Thought: RSI and RoC Combination
                Action: Design a factor that uses RSI and RoC in conjunction to signal trading opportunities
            Thought: SMACD and OBV Combination
                Action: Create a factor that combines SMACD and OBV to identify trend reversals
    Thought: Final Alpha Signal
        Action: Multiply Adjusted Price Momentum by Smoothed Price Momentum
        Action: Multiply result by Weighted Volume Indicator
        Action: Add result to Combined Intraday Momentum and Volume Impact
        Action: Output the final alpha factor
