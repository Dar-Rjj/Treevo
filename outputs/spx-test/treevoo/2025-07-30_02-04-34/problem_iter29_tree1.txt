Thought: Synthesized Alpha Factors from Price, Volume, and Intraday Momentum
    Thought: Momentum-Based Factor
        Action: Calculate short-term momentum as (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5]
        Action: Calculate long-term momentum as (close[t] - close[t-20]) / close[t-20]
        Action: Subtract long-term momentum from short-term momentum to get momentum difference
    Thought: Volume-Based Factor
        Action: Use (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) as the change in volume
        Action: Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5 as the average volume over the last 5 days
        Action: Divide volume change by average volume to get volume change factor
    Thought: Price Action Factor
        Action: Use high[t] - low[t] as the daily range
        Action: Use close[t] - open[t] as the daily spread
        Action: Divide open-close spread by high-low range to get price action factor
    Thought: Intraday Analysis
        Action: Calculate intraday high-low spread as high[t] - low[t]
        Action: Calculate close-open spread as close[t] - open[t]
        Action: Calculate smoothed intraday return as (high[t] - low[t]) / close[t], apply EMA with span 5, exclude latest value
        Action: Multiply smoothed intraday return by inverse of average volume
        Action: Identify volume spike if (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) > 2 * average volume change, use rolling window of last 20 days for average
        Action: Multiply smoothed intraday return by volume spike, smooth using SMA with window 4, exclude most recent value
        Action: Use next day's open price, subtract from current day's close price
    Thought: Composite Factor
        Action: Combine momentum difference, volume change factor, price action factor, and intraday momentum and volume impact
        Action: Assign weights to each factor (e.g., 0.4 * momentum difference + 0.3 * volume change factor + 0.1 * price action factor + 0.2 * intraday momentum and volume impact)
