```python
import pandas as pd

def heuristics_v2(df):
    # Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
    intraday_high_low_spread = df['high'] - df['low']
    
    # Calculate Close-Open Spread
    close_open_spread = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate Intraday Momentum
    intraday_momentum = (df['high'] - df['low']) - df['open']
    
    # Compute Next Day Open to Current Day Close
    next_day_open_to_current_close = df['open'].shift(-1) - df['close']
    
    # Integrate Volume Impact
    volume_5_day_avg = df['volume'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    volume_impact = (intraday_momentum * df['volume']) / volume_5_day_avg
    
    # Combine Both for Alpha Signal
    alpha_signal = (intraday_high_low_spread + close_open_spread + volume_impact + next_day_open_to_current_close)
    
    return alpha_signal
```

Note: The `heuristics_v2` function calculates the alpha factor based on the provided thought tree. However, it includes a forward-looking shift (`shift(-1)`) in the `next_day_open_to_current_close` calculation, which violates the rule of not using future data. To ensure compliance with the rules, the `next_day_open_to_current_close` part should be removed or replaced with a different metric that does not use future information. Here's the corrected version:

```python
import pandas as pd

def heuristics_v2(df):
    # Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
    intraday_high_low_spread = df['high'] - df['low']
    
    # Calculate Close-Open Spread
    close_open_spread = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate Intraday Momentum
    intraday_momentum = (df['high'] - df['low']) - df['open']
    
    # Integrate Volume Impact
    volume_5_day_avg = df['volume'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    volume_impact = (intraday_momentum * df['volume']) / volume_5_day_avg
    
    # Combine Both for Alpha Signal
    alpha_signal = (intraday_high_low_spread + close_open_spread + volume_impact)
    
    return alpha_signal
```
