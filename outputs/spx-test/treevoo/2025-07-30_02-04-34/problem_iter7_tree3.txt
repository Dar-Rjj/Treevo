Momentum Adjusted by Intraday Factors and Volume Spikes
├── Calculate Raw Momentum
│   ├── Use Close prices of the last n days
│   └── Calculate the difference between current and previous close
├── Identify Volume Spikes
│   ├── Compare current day volume with moving average of volume
│   │   ├── Use Volume of the last m days
│   │   └── Calculate the moving average
│   └── Determine if today's volume is a spike (above some threshold)
├── Adjust Momentum by Volume Spike
│   ├── If a volume spike, dampen the raw momentum using a multiplier < 1
│   └── If not a volume spike, use raw momentum
├── Combine Intraday Factors
│   ├── Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread Factor: (High - Low)
│   ├── Calculate Close-to-Open Return: (Close - Open)
│   └── Sum Intraday High-Low Spread Factor and Close-to-Open Return
├── Calculate Weighted Price Movement
│   ├── Use (Close - Open) * Volume as a measure of money flow
│   └── Divide by Average Volume: (Sum of Past 5 Days Volume / 5)
└── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply Adjusted Momentum by Combined Intraday Factor
    ├── Multiply by Weighted Price Movement
    └── Adjust for Volatility
        ├── Calculate Standard Deviation of Close Prices (last 10 days)
        └── Divide Final Alpha by 1 + (Standard Deviation)
