Crossover of Alpha Factor Generation
├── Conceptualization of Momentum Factors
│   ├── Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) for close prices over N days
│   │   └── Use SMA as a signal for buying (if current close > SMA) or selling (if current close < SMA)
│   ├── Determine the rate of change (ROC) for close prices over M days
│   │   └── Employ ROC to measure the speed at which the stock price is increasing or decreasing
│   └── Implement the relative strength (RS) by comparing the average gain and loss over L days
│       └── Apply RS to identify the general direction of the stock movement
├── Volume Analysis and Interpretation
│   ├── Compute the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) using (high + low + close)/3 with volume
│   │   └── Utilize VWAP as an indicator of fair value, where crossing above/below it suggests a bullish/bearish trend
│   ├── Evaluate the on-balance volume (OBV) to sum up volume on up-days and subtract on down-days
│   │   └── Use OBV divergence from the stock price to anticipate potential trend reversals
│   └── Calculate the money flow index (MFI) by averaging positive and negative money flows over P days
│       └── Leverage MFI to identify overbought/oversold conditions in the market
└── Price Action and Pattern Recognition
    ├── Identify the Aroon Oscillator, defined by the difference between Aroon Up and Aroon Down, each calculated over Q days
    │   └── Interpret Aroon Oscillator crossovers (+100 or -100 levels) as potential buy/sell signals
    ├── Establish the Ichimoku Cloud, incorporating conversion line, base line, leading span A, and B
    │   └── Use the cloud's color changes and line crossovers to gauge future support and resistance areas
    └── Formulate the Donchian Channels, comprised of upper (Ht-N high), lower (Lt-N low), and middle bands
        └── Exploit channel breakouts and reversion to the mean as trading opportunities
