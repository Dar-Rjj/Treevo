Thought: Synthesize Advanced Alpha Factors from Price, Volume, and Intraday Patterns
├── Thought: Momentum-Based Factor
│   ├── Action: Calculate Short-Term Momentum (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5]
│   ├── Action: Calculate Long-Term Momentum (close[t] - close[t-20]) / close[t-20]
│   └── Action: Subtract long-term momentum from short-term momentum to get momentum difference
├── Thought: Volume and Price Change Analysis
│   ├── Action: Calculate the difference between today's volume and the average volume over the past 30 days as an indication of unusual volume
│   ├── Action: Use (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) as the change in volume
│   ├── Action: Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5 as the average volume over the last 5 days
│   ├── Action: Use (volume[t] / volume[t-1]) as the volume ratio
│   └── Action: Multiply volume change by volume ratio to get enhanced volume change
├── Thought: Enhanced Price Action Factor
│   ├── Action: Use high[t] - low[t] as the daily range
│   ├── Action: Use close[t] - open[t] as the daily spread
│   ├── Action: Use high[t] - close[t] as the high-close spread
│   ├── Action: Divide open-close spread by high-low range, then subtract the high-close spread from it to get price action factor
│   └── Action: Combine the daily high-low range with the absolute value of today’s return (close - open) to form a combined indicator of market action
├── Thought: Intraday Analysis
│   ├── Action: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread (high[t] - low[t])
│   ├── Action: Calculate Close-Open Spread (close[t] - open[t])
│   ├── Action: Calculate Smoothed Intraday Return ((high[t] - low[t]) / close[t]) and apply EMA with span 5, exclude latest value
│   ├── Action: Calculate Average Volume over last 5 periods (Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5)
│   ├── Action: Multiply Intraday Momentum Difference by Inverse of Average Volume
│   ├── Action: Calculate Volume Change compared to previous day
│   ├── Action: Identify Spike if volume change > 1.75 * average volume change (keep a rolling window of the last 25 days for average computation)
│   ├── Action: Multiply Intraday Momentum Difference by Volume Spike
│   └── Action: Smooth the combined factor using simple moving average with window 4, exclude the most recent value
├── Thought: Composite Factor
│   ├── Action: Add momentum difference, enhanced volume change, and price action factor
│   ├── Action: Assign weights to each factor (e.g., 0.4 * momentum difference + 0.3 * enhanced volume change + 0.3 * price action factor)
│   └── Action: Adjust weights based on recent performance of each individual factor
├── Thought: Incorporate Close Price Trend
│   ├── Action: Calculate Close Price Change (close[t] - close[t-1])
│   ├── Action: Smooth Close Price Change using EMA with span 5, exclude latest value
│   └── Action: Calculate Difference between actual and smoothed close price change
├── Thought: Introduce Reversal Indicator
│   ├── Action: Calculate Long-Term Momentum (sum of daily price change over past 20 days / 20)
│   ├── Action: Calculate Short-Term Momentum (sum of daily price change over past 5 days / 5)
│   └── Action: Subtract Long-Term Momentum from Short-Term Momentum
└── Thought: Final Alpha Signal
    ├── Action: Multiply Adjusted Price Momentum by Smoothed Price Momentum
    ├── Action: Multiply result by Weighted Volume Indicator
    ├── Action: Add result to Combined Intraday Momentum and Volume Impact
    ├── Action: Add Smoothed Close Price Change
    └── Action: Add Reversal Indicator
