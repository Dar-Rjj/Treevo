Price Momentum with Volume Adjustment
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price from t-1 to t-n (n days)
│   └── Compute the Return
│       ├── Subtract Close price at t-n from Close price at t-1
│       └── Divide by Close price at t-n
└── Adjust Momentum by Volume
    ├── Use Volume for each day
    ├── Compute Weighted Average Volume
    │   ├── Sum of Volumes from t-1 to t-n
    │   └── Divide by n
    └── Multiply Price Momentum by Adjusted Volume
        ├── Normalize Volume by dividing each day's volume by the Weighted Average Volume
        └── Multiply the normalized volume by the computed Price Momentum
