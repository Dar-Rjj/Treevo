Thought: Develop a set of novel and interpretable alpha factors using (open, high, low, close) prices, amount, and volume.
    Sub-Thought: Calculate price momentum indicators that capture the trend of stock prices over different time windows.
        Sub-Thought: Compute the 5-day and 20-day simple moving averages (SMA) for the closing prices.
            Sub-Thought: Create an alpha factor as the ratio of the 5-day SMA to the 20-day SMA.
        Sub-Thought: Define a 20-day price return as the percentage change in the closing price from 20 days ago.
            Sub-Thought: Use the 20-day price return as a standalone alpha factor.
        Sub-Thought: Construct a 10-day average direction index (ADX) using high and low prices to measure trend strength.
            Sub-Thought: Employ the 10-day ADX as an alpha factor.
    Sub-Thought: Incorporate volume-related features to reflect market sentiment and liquidity conditions.
        Sub-Thought: Formulate a 20-day average daily trading volume.
            Sub-Thought: Develop an alpha factor as the difference between the current day's volume and the 20-day average daily trading volume.
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the 20-day cumulative volume delta, which is the sum of the differences between up-volume and down-volume over the last 20 days.
            Sub-Thought: Utilize the 20-day cumulative volume delta as an additional alpha factor.
    Sub-Thought: Combine price and volume data to create composite factors indicating potential market inefficiencies.
        Sub-Thought: Generate a 20-day money flow index (MFI) by considering typical price and raw volume.
            Sub-Thought: Introduce the 20-day MFI as an alpha factor.
        Sub-Thought: Measure the 20-day accumulation/distribution line (A/D Line) to assess the buying and selling pressure.
            Sub-Thought: Adopt the 20-day A/D Line change as an interpretative alpha factor.
    Sub-Thought: Investigate intra-day trading patterns through the analysis of opening and closing prices.
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the 20-day average of the difference between open and close prices.
            Sub-Thought: Propose this average difference as an alpha factor to capture intra-day reversals.
        Sub-Thought: Determine the 20-day relative strength (RS) of the close price compared to the open price.
            Sub-Thought: Present the 20-day RS as an indicator of overnight price action strength.
