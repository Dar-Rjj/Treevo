Thought: Synthesized Alpha Factors from Price, Volume, and Intraday Momentum with Enhanced Integration
    Thought: Momentum-Based Factor
        Action: Calculate short-term momentum (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5]
        Action: Calculate long-term momentum (close[t] - close[t-20]) / close[t-20]
        Action: Subtract long-term momentum from short-term momentum to get momentum difference
    Thought: Volume-Based Factor
        Action: Calculate volume change (volume[t] - volume[t-1])
        Action: Calculate average volume Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5
        Action: Divide volume change by average volume to get volume change factor
    Thought: Price Action Factor
        Action: Calculate daily range high[t] - low[t]
        Action: Calculate daily spread close[t] - open[t]
        Action: Divide open-close spread by high-low range to get price action factor
    Thought: Intraday Analysis
        Action: Calculate intraday high-low spread high[t] - low[t]
        Action: Calculate close-open spread close[t] - open[t]
        Action: Calculate smoothed intraday return (high[t] - low[t]) / open[t], apply EMA with span 5, exclude latest value
        Action: Multiply smoothed intraday return by inverse of average volume
        Action: Detect volume spikes if volume change > 1.75 * average volume change, use rolling window of last 25 days for average
        Action: Multiply smoothed intraday return by volume spike, smooth using SMA with window 4, exclude most recent value
        Action: Integrate next day open to current day close, subtract next day's open price from current day's close price
    Thought: Moving Averages
        Action: Calculate SMA of closing prices over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 days)
        Action: Calculate EMA of closing prices for the same periods
        Action: Subtract SMA over a longer period from SMA over a shorter period to get SMACD
    Thought: Composite Factor
        Action: Add momentum difference, volume change factor, price action factor, and intraday momentum and volume impact
        Action: Assign weights to each factor (e.g., 0.4 * momentum difference + 0.3 * volume change factor + 0.1 * price action factor + 0.2 * intraday momentum and volume impact)
        Thought: Proprietary Factors
            Action: Create a factor combining SMA and EMA crossovers
            Action: Design a factor that uses RSI and RoC in conjunction to signal trading opportunities
            Action: Create a factor that combines SMACD and OBV to identify trend reversals
    Thought: Final Alpha Signal
        Action: Multiply Adjusted Price Momentum by Smoothed Price Momentum
        Action: Multiply result by Weighted Volume Indicator
        Action: Add result to Combined Intraday Momentum and Volume Impact
        Action: Output the final alpha factor
