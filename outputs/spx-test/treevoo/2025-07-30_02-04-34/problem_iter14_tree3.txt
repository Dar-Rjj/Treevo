Thought: Utilize historical price data to identify momentum and mean reversion patterns as alpha factors
    Sub-thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices over different periods to identify trends
        Sub-thought: Compute a 5-day SMA
        Sub-thought: Compute a 20-day SMA
        Sub-thought: Compare the 5-day SMA with the 20-day SMA to generate a bullish or bearish signal
            Sub-thought: If 5-day SMA > 20-day SMA, signal is bullish
            Sub-thought: If 5-day SMA < 20-day SMA, signal is bearish
    Sub-thought: Use the high and low prices to identify volatility and breakout opportunities
        Sub-thought: Calculate the true range (TR) as max(high - low, abs(high - previous close), abs(low - previous close))
        Sub-thought: Compute the average true range (ATR) over a 14-day period
        Sub-thought: Identify potential breakout points when the ATR crosses above a certain threshold
            Sub-thought: Set a threshold for ATR (e.g., 1.5 * ATR)
            Sub-thought: If current ATR > threshold, signal potential breakout
    Sub-thought: Analyze the volume to identify significant buying or selling pressure
        Sub-thought: Calculate the relative volume (RV) by dividing the current day's volume by the average volume over the past 20 days
        Sub-thought: Identify days with significantly higher or lower than average volume
            Sub-thought: If RV > 1.5, signal strong buying or selling pressure
            Sub-thought: If RV < 0.7, signal weak trading activity
    Sub-thought: Combine the signals from SMA, ATR, and RV to create a composite alpha factor
        Sub-thought: Assign a score based on the presence of bullish or bearish signals from each component
            Sub-thought: +1 for bullish SMA crossover
            Sub-thought: -1 for bearish SMA crossover
            Sub-thought: +1 for ATR above threshold indicating potential breakout
            Sub-thought: +1 for RV > 1.5 indicating strong volume
            Sub-thought: -1 for RV < 0.7 indicating weak volume
        Sub-thought: Sum the scores to generate the final alpha factor
            Sub-thought: If total score > 0, indicate a positive alpha factor
            Sub-thought: If total score < 0, indicate a negative alpha factor
