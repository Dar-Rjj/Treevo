Thought: Develop Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume Data
    Thought: Momentum-Based Factor
        Thought: Calculate Short-Term Momentum
            Action: Use (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5] as short-term momentum
        Thought: Calculate Long-Term Momentum
            Action: Use (close[t] - close[t-20]) / close[t-20] as long-term momentum
        Thought: Combine Momentum Indicators
            Action: Subtract long-term momentum from short-term momentum to get momentum difference
    Thought: Volume-Based Factor
        Thought: Calculate Volume Change
            Action: Use (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) as the change in volume
        Thought: Calculate Average Volume
            Action: Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5 as the average volume over the last 5 days
        Thought: Combine Volume Indicators
            Action: Divide volume change by average volume to get normalized volume change
    Thought: Price Action Factor
        Thought: Calculate High-Low Range
            Action: Use high[t] - low[t] as the daily range
        Thought: Calculate Open-Close Spread
            Action: Use close[t] - open[t] as the daily spread
        Thought: Combine Range and Spread
            Action: Divide open-close spread by high-low range to get price action factor
    Thought: Composite Factor
        Thought: Combine All Factors
            Action: Add momentum difference, normalized volume change, and price action factor
        Thought: Weighted Combination
            Action: Assign weights to each factor (e.g., 0.4 * momentum difference + 0.3 * normalized volume change + 0.3 * price action factor)
