Crossover Enhanced Price and Volume Momentum Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Daily Logarithmic Price Return
│   ├── Use Close price of day t
│   └── Subtract with Close price of day (t-1)
│   └── Compute natural logarithm of the result
├── Calculate Volume Change Rate
│   ├── Use Volume of day t
│   └── Divide by Volume of day (t-1)
│   └── Subtract 1 from the result
├── Compute Smoothed Logarithmic Price Momentum
│   ├── Sum Daily Logarithmic Price Return over past 7 days
│   └── Divide by 7
├── Compute Exponential Weighted Volume Indicator
│   ├── Multiply Volume Change Rate of day t by its sign (positive or negative)
│   └── Apply exponential smoothing with a factor of 0.5 over the past 7 days
├── Combine Enhanced Indicators
│   ├── Multiply Smoothed Logarithmic Price Momentum by Exponential Weighted Volume Indicator
│   ├── Add result to a baseline signal, set initially to 0
│   └── Use this combined value as an intermediate alpha factor for day t
├── Adjust Intermediate Alpha Factor by Volume
    ├── Use Volume for each day from t-1 to t-7
    ├── Compute Weighted Average Volume
    │   ├── Sum of Volumes from t-1 to t-7
    │   └── Divide by 7
    └── Multiply Intermediate Alpha Factor by Adjusted Volume
        ├── Divide each day's volume by the Weighted Average Volume
        └── Multiply the adjusted volume by the computed Intermediate Alpha Factor
        └── Use this final value as the final alpha factor for day t
