Thought: Develop Alpha Factors Based on Price, Volume, and Momentum Data
    Thought: Momentum-Based Factor
        Thought: Calculate Short-Term Momentum
            Action: Use (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5] as short-term momentum
        Thought: Calculate Long-Term Momentum
            Action: Use (close[t] - close[t-20]) / close[t-20] as long-term momentum
        Thought: Combine Momentum Indicators
            Action: Subtract long-term momentum from short-term momentum to get momentum difference
    Thought: Volume-Based Factor
        Thought: Calculate Volume Change
            Action: Use (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) as the change in volume
        Thought: Calculate Average Volume
            Action: Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5 as the average volume over the last 5 days
        Thought: Combine Volume Indicators
            Action: Divide volume change by average volume to get volume change factor
    Thought: Price Action Factor
        Thought: Calculate High-Low Range
            Action: Use high[t] - low[t] as the daily range
        Thought: Calculate Open-Close Spread
            Action: Use close[t] - open[t] as the daily spread
        Thought: Combine Range and Spread
            Action: Divide open-close spread by high-low range to get price action factor
    Thought: Moving Averages
        Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA)
            Action: Calculate SMA of closing prices over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 days)
        Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
            Action: Calculate EMA of closing prices for the same periods
    Thought: Momentum Indicators
        Thought: Rate of Change (RoC)
            Action: Calculate RoC using closing prices to measure momentum
        Thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
            Action: Compute RSI to gauge overbought or oversold conditions
    Thought: Volume Trends
        Thought: Volume Moving Average
            Action: Compare daily volume with a moving average of volume (e.g., 20-day MA of volume)
        Thought: Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
            Action: Use VWAP to understand how much volume is at each price point
    Thought: Volatility Measures
        Thought: Average True Range (ATR)
            Action: Calculate ATR to measure market volatility
        Thought: Bollinger Bands
            Action: Plot standard deviations away from an SMA of closing prices
    Thought: Composite Factor
        Thought: Combine All Factors
            Action: Add momentum difference, volume change factor, and price action factor
        Thought: Weighted Combination
            Action: Assign weights to each factor (e.g., 0.4 * momentum difference + 0.3 * volume change factor + 0.3 * price action factor)
        Thought: Proprietary Factors
            Thought: SMA and EMA Crossover
                Action: Create a factor combining SMA and EMA crossovers
            Thought: RSI and RoC Combination
                Action: Design a factor that uses RSI and RoC in conjunction to signal trading opportunities
