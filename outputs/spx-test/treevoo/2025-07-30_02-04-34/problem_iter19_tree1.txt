Thought: Develop Alpha Factors Based on Price and Volume Data
    Thought: Momentum-Based Factor
        Action: Calculate Short-Term Momentum as (close[t] - close[t-5]) / close[t-5]
        Action: Calculate Long-Term Momentum as (close[t] - close[t-20]) / close[t-20]
        Action: Subtract long-term momentum from short-term momentum to get momentum difference
    Thought: Volume-Based Factor
        Action: Use (volume[t] - volume[t-1]) as the change in volume
        Action: Sum(volume[t-4:t]) / 5 as the average volume over the last 5 days
        Action: Divide volume change by average volume to get normalized volume change
    Thought: Price Action Factor
        Action: Use high[t] - low[t] as the daily range
        Action: Use close[t] - open[t] as the daily spread
        Action: Divide open-close spread by high-low range to get price action factor
    Thought: Composite Factor
        Action: Add momentum difference, normalized volume change, and price action factor
        Action: Assign weights to each factor (e.g., 0.4 * momentum difference + 0.3 * normalized volume change + 0.3 * price action factor)
