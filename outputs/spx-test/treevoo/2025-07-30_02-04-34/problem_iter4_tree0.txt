Momentum Adjusted by Volume Spikes

└── Adjust Momentum Using Volume Spike
    ├── Compare current day volume with moving average of last m days
    │   └── Determine if today's volume is a spike (exceeding a threshold)
    └── If a volume spike, dampen the raw momentum
        ├── Apply a reduction factor (less than 1) to the raw momentum
