Price Momentum with Volume and Amount Adjustment
├── Calculate Price Momentum
│   ├── Use Close price from t-1 to t-n (n days)
│   └── Compute the Return
│       ├── Subtract Close price at t-n from Close price at t-1
│       └── Divide by Close price at t-n
├── Adjust Momentum by Volume and Amount
    ├── Use Volume and Amount for each day
    ├── Compute Weighted Average Volume
    │   ├── Sum of Volumes from t-1 to t-n
    │   └── Divide by n
    ├── Compute Weighted Average Amount
    │   ├── Sum of Amounts from t-1 to t-n
    │   └── Divide by n
    ├── Adjust Volume and Amount
        ├── Adjust Volume by subtracting the Weighted Average Volume
        ├── Adjust Amount by subtracting the Weighted Average Amount
    ├── Multiply Price Momentum by Adjusted Volume and Amount
        ├── Compute the ratio of Adjusted Volume to Adjusted Amount
        └── Multiply the result by the computed Price Momentum
