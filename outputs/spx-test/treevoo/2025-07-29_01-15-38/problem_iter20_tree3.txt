Thought: Synthesize price, volume, and momentum patterns to predict future stock returns
- Thought: Analyze the relationship between closing prices and future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price over a short term (e.g., 5 days)
    - Sub-Thought: Use the percentage change as a predictive factor
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price over a medium term (e.g., 20 days)
    - Sub-Thought: Use the percentage change as a predictive factor
- Thought: Investigate the impact of high, low, and open prices on future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the range (high - low) and its ratio to the previous close
    - Sub-Thought: Use the range and its ratio to the previous close as a predictive factor
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the gap (open - close of the previous day) and its absolute value
    - Sub-Thought: Use the gap and its absolute value as a predictive factor
- Thought: Examine the significance of volume changes on future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume over a short term (e.g., 5 days)
    - Sub-Thought: Use the percentage change in volume as a predictive factor
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the average volume over a longer period (e.g., 20 days) and compare it to the current day's volume
    - Sub-Thought: Use the comparison (current volume / average volume) as a predictive factor
- Thought: Combine multiple indicators to create composite alpha factors
  - Sub-Thought: Create a composite factor by multiplying the short-term closing price change with the short-term volume change
    - Sub-Thought: Use the composite factor as a predictive signal
  - Sub-Thought: Create another composite factor by combining the high-low range ratio, the gap, and the volume change
    - Sub-Thought: Use the composite factor as a predictive signal
- Thought: Incorporate short-term and long-term price momentum
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum using Close price of last 5 days
    - Sub-Thought: Use the average of the last 5 days' closing prices
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Long-Term Price Momentum using Close prices over the past 20 days
    - Sub-Thought: Use the average of the last 20 days' closing prices
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Momentum Oscillator
    - Sub-Thought: Subtract Long-Term Momentum from Short-Term Momentum
      - Sub-Thought: Output the difference
- Thought: Adjust for Volume Fluctuations
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Average Volume of last 5 days
    - Sub-Thought: Sum Volumes of last 5 days
    - Sub-Thought: Divide by 5
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Relative Volume (Vol_t / Avg Vol_5)
  - Sub-Thought: Multiply Short-Term Price Momentum by Relative Volume
- Thought: Weight by Volume Surge
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate 10-Day Volume Average
    - Sub-Thought: Day t Volume
    - Sub-Thought: Day (t-9) Volume
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Average
  - Sub-Thought: Apply Volume Surge Weight
    - Sub-Thought: If Vol_t > 1.5 * Avg Vol_10, set weight = 1.5
    - Sub-Thought: If Vol_t > Avg Vol_10, set weight = 1.2
    - Sub-Thought: Else, set weight = 1
- Thought: Apply Price Range Filter
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Price Range (High_t - Low_t)
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate AvgDailyPriceRange over past 20 days
    - Sub-Thought: Sum of Daily Price Ranges over past 20 days
    - Sub-Thought: Divide by 20
  - Sub-Thought: If (DailyPriceRange_t > 1.5 * AvgDailyPriceRange_20), set factor to 0
- Thought: Apply Volatility Filter
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Return (Close_t - Close_t-1) / Close_t-1
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Standard Deviation of Daily Returns over past 20 days
    - Sub-Thought: Sum of squared daily returns over past 20 days
    - Sub-Thought: Divide by 20, then take square root
  - Sub-Thought: If (StdDev_DailyReturns_20 > 0.03), set factor to 0
- Thought: Introduce High-Low Range Indicator
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily High-Low Range (High_t - Low_t)
