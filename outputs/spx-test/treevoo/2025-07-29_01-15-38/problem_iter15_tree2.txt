Crossover High-Low Range and Weighted Momentum Oscillator with Volume Surge and Close Price Velocity
├── Calculate High-Low Range
│   ├── Subtract Low from High
├── Calculate Short-Term High-Low Range Momentum
│   ├── Take the difference with the previous day's range
│   └── Sum over the past 5 days
├── Calculate Long-Term High-Low Range Momentum
│   ├── Take the difference with the previous day's range
│   └── Sum over the past 20 days
├── Calculate High-Low Range Momentum Oscillator
│   ├── Subtract Long-Term High-Low Range Momentum from Short-Term High-Low Range Momentum
├── Weight by Volume Surge
│   ├── Calculate Volume Ratio
│   │   ├── Calculate Average of the past 10 days' volumes
│   └── Assign weight based on current volume
│       ├── If current volume is more than 1.5 times the 10-day average, assign a weight of 1.7
│       ├── If current volume is less than 1.5 but more than the 10-day average, assign a weight of 1.3
│       └── Otherwise, assign a weight of 1
├── Integrate Close Price Velocity
│   ├── Calculate Close Price Change
│   │   ├── Subtract previous day's close from current day's close
│   └── Apply Velocity Factor
│       ├── If close price change is positive, multiply by 1.3
│       └── If close price change is negative or zero, multiply by 0.7
├── Incorporate Open-Price Momentum
│   ├── Calculate Open-Price Difference
│   │   ├── Subtract previous day's open from current day's open
│   └── Apply Momentum Adjuster
│       ├── If open-price difference is positive, add 0.6 to the factor
│       └── If open-price difference is negative, subtract 0.6 from the factor
├── Integrate High-Price Momentum
│   ├── Calculate High-Price Difference
│   │   ├── Subtract previous day's high from current day's high
│   └── Apply High-Price Momentum Adjuster
│       ├── If high-price difference is positive, add 0.4 to the factor
│       └── If high-price difference is negative, subtract 0.4 from the factor
├── Final Alpha Factor
    ├── Multiply High-Low Range Momentum Oscillator by Volume Weight
    ├── Multiply the result by Close Price Velocity Factor
    ├── Add Open-Price Momentum Adjuster
    ├── Add High-Price Momentum Adjuster
    └── Output the final factor value
