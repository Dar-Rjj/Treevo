Thought: Explore Price and Volume Relationships for Predicting Returns
- Sub-thought: Analyze Close Price Movements
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate daily price change
    - Leaf: close(t) - close(t-1)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the average close price over a short period
    - Leaf: (close(t) + close(t-1) + ... + close(t-n))/n
- Sub-thought: Examine Volume Patterns
  - Sub-sub-thought: Determine the difference in volume from previous day
    - Leaf: volume(t) - volume(t-1)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Find a rolling sum of volume over a set window
    - Leaf: volume(t) + volume(t-1) + ... + volume(t-n)
- Sub-thought: Investigate High, Low, and Open Prices for Volatility Indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute daily price range
    - Leaf: high(t) - low(t)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Evaluate the gap between open and close prices
    - Leaf: abs(open(t) - close(t))
  - Sub-sub-thought: Measure how often the close price is above or below the daily midpoint
    - Leaf: if(close(t) > (high(t)+low(t))/2, 1, 0)
- Sub-thought: Consider Combined Price and Volume Indicators
  - Sub-sub-thought: Develop a ratio of price change to volume change
    - Leaf: (close(t) - close(t-1)) / (volume(t) - volume(t-1))
  - Sub-sub-thought: Create an indicator that combines daily volatility and trading volume
    - Leaf: ((high(t)-low(t))/average(volume(t), volume(t-1), ..., volume(t-n)))
