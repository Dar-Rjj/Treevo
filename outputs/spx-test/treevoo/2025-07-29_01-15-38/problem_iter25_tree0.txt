Thought: Synthesize Intraday and Multi-Day Momentum with Volume Influence for Enhanced Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Adjusted Daily Trend
│   ├── (Close - Open) / Open
│   ├── 10-day EMA of (Close - Open)
│   └── (Current Day's (Close - Open)) / 10-day EMA
├── Incorporate Volatility
│   ├── (High - Low)
│   └── (Current Day's (Close - Open) / 10-day EMA) / (High - Low)
├── Integrate Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Sum of (Volume * Adjusted Trend) over 5 days
├── Long-Term Trend Indicator
│   ├── 20-day SMA of Close prices
│   ├── 50-day SMA of Close prices
│   ├── Difference between 20-day and 50-day SMA
│   └── Multiply by the sum from the previous sub-thought
├── Conditional Adjustment for Trend
│   ├── If 20-day SMA > 50-day SMA, multiply by positive sensitivity
│   └── Otherwise, multiply by negative sensitivity
├── Complementary Intraday Returns
│   ├── (High - Low) / Open + (Close - Open) / Open
├── Volume Classification
│   ├── Current Day's Volume / Previous Day's Volume
│   ├── If Volume ratio > 1.5, output 2
│   ├── If Volume ratio between 0.8 and 1.5, output 1
│   ├── If Volume ratio between 0.3 and 0.8, output 0
│   └── If Volume ratio < 0.3, output -2
└── Final Factor Adjustment
    ├── Adjusted Combined Returns Based on Volume Trend
    │   └── Multiply combined returns by volume trend classification
    ├── Add to the primary factor result after conditional adjustment
    └── Cumulative Movement Over a Window
        └── Apply summation of daily factors over a defined lookback period
