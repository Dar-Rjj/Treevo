Thought: Calculate the difference between the daily closing price and the opening price to evaluate the day's directional movement.
  Sub-thought: Calculate the exponential moving average of the daily close-open difference over a 10-day period to smooth out short-term fluctuations and identify a trend.
    Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of the current day's close-open difference to the 10-day EMA of the close-open difference, aiming to quantify the strength or weakness of the current day's trend against the recent trend.
      Sub-thought: Use the high-low spread (High - Low) to measure the intra-day volatility and incorporate it into the factor by dividing the previously calculated ratio with this spread, to adjust the interpretation based on the relative volatility.
        Sub-thought: Consider the volume in relation to the high-low spread by calculating the sum of the product of volume and the adjusted ratio (from the previous sub-thought) over the past 5 days, to capture the momentum influenced by trading volume.
          Sub-thought: To add a dimension that reflects the potential for future movement, calculate the difference between the 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages of the closing prices, and integrate this difference as a multiplier to the accumulated volume-adjusted trend strength score.
            Sub-thought: Finally, refine the factor by introducing a conditional element where if the 20-day SMA is above the 50-day SMA (indicating an uptrend), the entire constructed factor is multiplied by a positive sensitivity value; otherwise (indicative of a downtrend), it is multiplied by a negative sensitivity, dynamically adjusting the factor's optimism or pessimism regarding future returns.
