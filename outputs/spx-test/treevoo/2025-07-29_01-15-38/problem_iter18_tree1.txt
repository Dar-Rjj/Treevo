Thought: Explore price and volume patterns to identify potential alpha factors
- Thought: Analyze the relationship between closing prices and future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price over a short term (e.g., 5 days)
    - Sub-Thought: Use the percentage change as a predictive factor
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing price over a medium term (e.g., 20 days)
    - Sub-Thought: Use the percentage change as a predictive factor
- Thought: Investigate the impact of high, low, and open prices on future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the range (high - low) and its ratio to the previous close
    - Sub-Thought: Use the range and its ratio to the previous close as a predictive factor
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the gap (open - close of the previous day) and its absolute value
    - Sub-Thought: Use the gap and its absolute value as a predictive factor
- Thought: Examine the significance of volume changes on future returns
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in volume over a short term (e.g., 5 days)
    - Sub-Thought: Use the percentage change in volume as a predictive factor
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate the average volume over a longer period (e.g., 20 days) and compare it to the current day's volume
    - Sub-Thought: Use the comparison (current volume / average volume) as a predictive factor
- Thought: Combine multiple indicators to create composite alpha factors
  - Sub-Thought: Create a composite factor by multiplying the short-term closing price change with the short-term volume change
    - Sub-Thought: Use the composite factor as a predictive signal
  - Sub-Thought: Create another composite factor by combining the high-low range ratio, the gap, and the volume change
    - Sub-Thought: Use the composite factor as a predictive signal
