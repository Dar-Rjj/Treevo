    - Calculate Intraday Return
      - Use Close price
      - Subtract Open price
    - Calculate Weighted High-Low Spread
      - Compute (High - Low)
      - Multiply by Current Day's Volume
    - Compute 5-Day Price Momentum
      - Sum Close prices of last 5 days
      - Divide by 5
    - Incorporate Volume Influence
      - Compute 5-Day Average Volume
        - Sum Volumes of last 5 days
        - Divide by 5
      - Determine Relative Volume
        - Use Current Day's Volume
        - Divide by 5-Day Average Volume
      - Adjust 5-Day Momentum
        - Multiply 5-Day Price Momentum
        - By Relative Volume
    - Analyze Volume Change
      - Current Day's Volume / Previous Day's Volume
    - Classify Volume Trend
      - If Volume ratio > 1.5, output 2
      - If Volume ratio between 0.5 and 1.5, output 0
      - If Volume ratio < 0.5, output -2
  - Exploration of Trend and Volume Interactions
    - Analysis Based on Price Action
      - Examine the High-Low Spread
        - Calculate the daily high-low spread
        - Consider the trend in the high-low spread over time
          - Identify significant expansions or contractions as potential signals
        - Evaluate the ratio of (Close - Open) to (High - Low)
          - Look for patterns indicating strong directional moves
      - Investigate the Close-Open Relation
        - Determine the close-open difference
        - Analyze if closing prices are consistently higher or lower than opening prices
        - Consider the cumulative effect of close-open differentials
    - Investigation Through Volume Metrics
      - Assess the Volume-to-Price Movement Correlation
        - Compare changes in volume with price movements
        - Highlight periods of increasing volume accompanying price increases or decreases
      - Evaluate the Volume-to-Amount Ratio
        - Compute the ratio of volume to traded amount
        - Look for unusual spikes or drops that may indicate market sentiment
      - Analyze the Volume Momentum
        - Measure the change in volume from one period to the next
        - Identify sustained increases or decreases in volume as a sign of momentum
  - Combine Factors Based on Volume Classification
    - Combine Intraday Return
    - Add Weighted High-Low Spread
    - Add Adjusted 5-Day Price Momentum
    - Multiply by Volume Trend Classification
  - Apply Cumulative Movement
    - Sum factor values over a window
    - Assign to current day
  - Incorporate Technical Indicators
    - Moving Averages
      - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
        - Formula: sma = rolling_mean(close, window_size)
      - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
        - Formula: ema = exponential_moving_average(close, alpha)
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
      - Calculate Gains and Losses
        - Formula: gains = rolling_mean(max(price_change, 0), window_size)
        - Formula: losses = rolling_mean(abs(min(price_change, 0)), window_size)
      - Calculate RSI
        - Formula: rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + (gains / losses)))
  - Final Alpha Factor Synthesis
    - Combine All Factors
      - Formula: alpha_factor = w1 * (intraday_return + weighted_high_low_spread + adjusted_5day_momentum) * volume_trend_classification + w2 * pricerange_volume_ratio + w3 * n_day_return + w4 * short_term_reversal + w5 * sentiment_score + w6 * (sma - close_t) + w7 * (ema - close_t) + w8 * rsi
