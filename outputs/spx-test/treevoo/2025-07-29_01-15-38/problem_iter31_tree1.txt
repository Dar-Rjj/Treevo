Thought: Synthesize Intraday and Multi-Day Momentum with Volume Influence for Enhanced Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Adjusted Daily Trend
│   └── (Close - Open) / 10-day EMA of (Close - Open)
├── Incorporate Volatility
│   └── Adjusted Daily Trend / (High - Low)
├── Integrate Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   └── Sum of (Volume * Adjusted Daily Trend / (High - Low)) over 5 days
├── Long-Term Trend Adjustment
│   ├── Difference between 20-day and 50-day SMA of Close prices
│   └── Multiply by the sum from the previous sub-thought
├── Conditional Trend Sensitivity
│   ├── If 20-day SMA > 50-day SMA, multiply by positive sensitivity
│   └── Otherwise, multiply by negative sensitivity
└── Final Factor Calculation
    └── Multiply combined returns by volume trend classification
        ├── Current Day's Volume / Previous Day's Volume
        ├── If Volume ratio > 1.5, output 2
        ├── If Volume ratio between 0.8 and 1.5, output 1
        ├── If Volume ratio between 0.3 and 0.8, output 0
        └── If Volume ratio < 0.3, output -2
