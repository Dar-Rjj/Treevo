Thought: Synthesize Momentum, Reversal, and Volume Interactions for Alpha Generation
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Short-Term Price Momentum
    - Action: Compute the percentage change in closing price over the last 5 days
      - Formula: short_term_momentum = (close_t / close_t-5) - 1
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Long-Term Price Momentum
    - Action: Compute the percentage change in closing price over the last 20 days
      - Formula: long_term_momentum = (close_t / close_t-20) - 1
  - Sub-Thought: Identify Reversal Signals
    - Action: Check if short-term momentum is negative and long-term momentum is positive
      - Formula: reversal_signal = (short_term_momentum < 0) and (long_term_momentum > 0)
  - Sub-Thought: Integrate Trading Volume
    - Action: Compute the average volume over the last 10 days
      - Formula: avg_volume_10d = sum(volume_t-10 to volume_t-1) / 10
    - Action: Compare current volume to average volume for the last 10 days
      - Formula: volume_ratio = volume_t / avg_volume_10d
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze Opening and Closing Price Relations
    - Action: Compute the difference between open and close prices
      - Formula: price_difference = open_t - close_t
    - Action: Determine if the stock tends to gap up or down
      - Formula: gap_direction = 1 if open_t > close_t else -1
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate High and Low Price Variability
    - Action: Calculate the range (high - low) for each day
      - Formula: daily_range = high_t - low_t
    - Action: Compute the average daily range over the last 30 days
      - Formula: avg_daily_range_30d = sum(daily_range_t-30 to daily_range_t-1) / 30
  - Sub-Thought: Combine Price and Volume Factors
    - Action: Calculate the ratio of today's volume to the average volume
      - Formula: volume_ratio = volume_t / avg_volume_10d
    - Action: Multiply the ratio by the percentage change in closing price
      - Formula: price_volume_factor = (close_t / close_t-1 - 1) * volume_ratio
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze Daily Price Movements
    - Formula: price_change = close_t - close_t-1
    - Formula: price_range = high_t - low_t
  - Sub-Thought: Examine Volume Trends
    - Formula: volume_change = volume_t - volume_t-1
  - Sub-Thought: Incorporate Technical Indicators
    - Formula: sma = rolling_mean(close, window_size)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Gains and Losses
      - Formula: gains = rolling_mean(max(price_change, 0), window_size)
      - Formula: losses = rolling_mean(abs(min(price_change, 0)), window_size)
    - Formula: rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + (gains / losses)))
  - Sub-Thought: Evaluate Market Sentiment
    - Formula: positive_closes = sum(price_change > 0)
    - Formula: negative_closes = sum(price_change < 0)
    - Formula: sentiment_score = positive_closes - negative_closes
  - Sub-Thought: Final Alpha Factor Synthesis
    - Formula: alpha_factor = w1 * price_volume_factor + w2 * (price_range / volume_t) + w3 * short_term_momentum + w4 * reversal_signal + w5 * sentiment_score + w6 * (sma - close_t) + w7 * rsi
