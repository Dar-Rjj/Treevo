Thought: Synthesize Intraday and Multi-Day Momentum with Volume Influence for Enhanced Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Daily Trend Strength

├── Incorporating Volume-Adjusted Momentum
│   ├── Sum of (Volume * Adjusted Trend) over 5 days
├── Integrate Long-Term Trend Indicator
│   ├── 20-day SMA of Close prices
│   ├── 50-day SMA of Close prices
│   ├── Difference between 20-day and 50-day SMA
│   └── Multiply by the sum from the previous sub-thought
├── Conditional Adjustment for Uptrend or Downtrend
│   ├── If 20-day SMA > 50-day SMA, multiply by positive sensitivity
│   ├── Otherwise, multiply by negative sensitivity

│   ├── (Close - Open) / Open
├── Combined Intraday and Open-to-Close Returns
│   ├── (High - Low) / Open + (Close - Open) / Open
├── Volume Classification
│   ├── Current Day's Volume / Previous Day's Volume
│   ├── If Volume ratio > 1.5, output 2
│   ├── If Volume ratio between 0.8 and 1.5, output 1
│   ├── If Volume ratio between 0.3 and 0.8, output 0
│   ├── If Volume ratio < 0.3, output -2
