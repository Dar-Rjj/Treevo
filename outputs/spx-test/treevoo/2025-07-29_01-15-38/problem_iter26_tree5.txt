- Crossover Intraday, Volume-Enhanced Hybrid Momentum, and Weight-Adjusted Oscillator with Enhanced Volume Analysis
  - Calculate 5-Day Price Momentum
    - Sum Close prices of last 5 days
    - Divide by 5
  - Incorporate Volume Influence
    - Compute 5-Day Average Volume
      - Sum Volumes of last 5 days
      - Divide by 5
    - Determine Relative Volume
      - Current Day's Volume / 5-Day Average Volume
    - Adjust 5-Day Momentum
      - 5-Day Price Momentum * Relative Volume
  - Calculate Intraday Returns
    - (High - Low) / Open
  - Calculate Open-to-Close Returns
    - (Close - Open) / Open
  - Combine Intraday and Open-to-Close Returns
    - Sum Intraday Returns and Open-to-Close Returns
  - Analyze Volume Change
    - Current Day's Volume / Previous Day's Volume
  - Classify Volume Trend
    - If Volume ratio > 2.0, output 3
    - If Volume ratio between 1.8 and 2.0, output 2
    - If Volume ratio between 1.6 and 1.8, output 1
    - If Volume ratio between 0.9 and 1.6, output 0
    - If Volume ratio between 0.7 and 0.9, output -1
    - If Volume ratio between 0.5 and 0.7, output -2
    - If Volume ratio < 0.5, output -3
  - Adjust Combined Returns Based on Volume Classification
    - Combined Returns * Volume Trend Classification
  - Calculate Short-Term Momentum
    - Average Close prices from Day t to Day (t-7)
  - Calculate Long-Term Momentum
    - Average Close prices from Day t to Day (t-25)
  - Calculate Momentum Oscillator
    - Short-Term Momentum - Long-Term Momentum
  - Integrate Volume with Intraday Dynamics
    - (High - Low) * Relative Volume
  - Final Alpha Factor
    - Multiply Adjusted Combined Returns by Momentum Oscillator
    - Add High-Low Spread adjusted by Relative Volume
    - Apply Volume Trend Weight
      - Multiply by Volume Trend Classification

    - Evaluate the ratio of (Close - Open) to (High - Low)
      - Look for patterns indicating strong directional moves
  - Investigate the Close-Open Relation
    - Determine the close-open difference
    - Analyze if closing prices are consistently higher or lower than opening prices
    - Consider the cumulative effect of close-open differentials
  - Assess the Volume-to-Price Movement Correlation
    - Compare changes in volume with price movements
    - Highlight periods of increasing volume accompanying price increases or decreases
  - Evaluate the Volume-to-Amount Ratio
    - Compute the ratio of volume to traded amount
    - Look for unusual spikes or drops that may indicate market sentiment
  - Analyze the Volume Momentum
    - Measure the change in volume from one period to the next
    - Identify sustained increases or decreases in volume as a sign of momentum
  - Combine Factors Based on Volume Classification
    - Combine Intraday Return
    - Add Weighted High-Low Spread
