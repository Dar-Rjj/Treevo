Thought: Explore Price Patterns and Volume Interactions
- Sub-Thought: Analyze Daily Price Movements
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Price Change
    - Sub-Thought: Use Today's Close and Yesterday's Close
      - Formula: price_change = close_t - close_t-1
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Price Range
    - Sub-Thought: Use High and Low of the Day
      - Formula: price_range = high_t - low_t
- Sub-Thought: Examine Volume Trends
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Volume Change
    - Sub-Thought: Use Today's Volume and Yesterday's Volume
      - Formula: volume_change = volume_t - volume_t-1
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Average Volume
    - Sub-Thought: Use a Rolling Window of Volume
      - Formula: avg_volume = rolling_mean(volume, window_size)
- Sub-Thought: Combine Price and Volume Factors
  - Sub-Thought: Create Price-Volume Factor
    - Sub-Thought: Multiply Price Change and Volume Change
      - Formula: price_volume_factor = price_change * volume_change
  - Sub-Thought: Create Price-Range to Volume Ratio
    - Sub-Thought: Divide Price Range by Average Volume
      - Formula: pricerange_volume_ratio = price_range / avg_volume
- Sub-Thought: Analyze Momentum and Reversal
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate N-Day Return
    - Sub-Thought: Use Close Prices Over N Days
      - Formula: n_day_return = (close_t / close_t-n) - 1
  - Sub-Thought: Identify Short-Term Reversals
    - Sub-Thought: Use 2-Day Returns
      - Formula: short_term_reversal = (close_t-1 / close_t-2) - 1
- Sub-Thought: Evaluate Market Sentiment
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Number of Positive and Negative Closes
    - Sub-Thought: Count Days with Positive and Negative Price Changes
      - Formula: positive_closes = sum(price_change > 0)
      - Formula: negative_closes = sum(price_change < 0)
  - Sub-Thought: Create Sentiment Score
    - Sub-Thought: Use the Difference Between Positive and Negative Closes
      - Formula: sentiment_score = positive_closes - negative_closes
- Sub-Thought: Incorporate Technical Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Moving Averages
    - Sub-Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA)
      - Sub-Thought: Use a Rolling Window of Close Prices
        - Formula: sma = rolling_mean(close, window_size)
    - Sub-Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
      - Sub-Thought: Use a Smoothing Factor
        - Formula: ema = exponential_moving_average(close, alpha)
  - Sub-Thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate Gains and Losses
      - Sub-Thought: Use a Rolling Window of Price Changes
        - Formula: gains = rolling_mean(price_change_positive, window_size)
        - Formula: losses = rolling_mean(abs(price_change_negative), window_size)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate RSI
      - Formula: rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + (gains / losses)))
- Sub-Thought: Final Alpha Factor Synthesis
  - Sub-Thought: Combine All Factors
    - Sub-Thought: Weighted Sum of Factors
      - Formula: alpha_factor = w1 * price_volume_factor + w2 * pricerange_volume_ratio + w3 * n_day_return + w4 * short_term_reversal + w5 * sentiment_score + w6 * (sma - close_t) + w7 * (ema - close_t) + w8 * rsi
