      - Analyze if closing prices consistently higher or lower than opening prices
  - Investigation Through Volume Metrics
    - Assess the Volume-to-Price Movement Correlation
      - Compare changes in volume with price movements
      - Highlight periods of increasing volume with price increases or decreases
    - Evaluate the Volume-to-Amount Ratio
      - Compute the ratio of volume to traded amount
      - Look for unusual spikes or drops
    - Analyze the Volume Momentum
      - Measure the change in volume from one period to the next
      - Identify sustained increases or decreases in volume
  - Integration of Price and Volume Indicators
    - Combine high-low spread trends with volume momentum
      - Develop a composite factor
    - Synthesize close-open relation with volume-to-amount ratio
      - Create a factor reflecting both price movement strength and trading activity
