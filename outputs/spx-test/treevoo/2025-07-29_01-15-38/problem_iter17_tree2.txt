Crossover and Synthesis of Parent Trees

- Exploration of Trend and Volume Dynamics
  - Analysis Based on Price Action
    - Examine the High-Low Spread
      - Calculate the daily high-low spread
      - Consider the trend in the high-low spread over time
        - Identify significant expansions or contractions as potential signals
      - Evaluate the ratio of (Close - Open) to (High - Low)
        - Look for patterns indicating strong directional moves
    - Investigate the Close-Open Relation
      - Determine the close-open difference
      - Analyze if closing prices are consistently higher or lower than opening prices
      - Consider the cumulative effect of close-open differentials
  - Investigation Through Volume Metrics
    - Assess the Volume-to-Price Movement Correlation
      - Compare changes in volume with price movements
      - Highlight periods of increasing volume accompanying price increases or decreases
    - Evaluate the Volume-to-Amount Ratio
      - Compute the ratio of volume to traded amount
      - Look for unusual spikes or drops that may indicate market sentiment
    - Analyze the Volume Momentum
      - Measure the change in volume from one period to the next
      - Identify sustained increases or decreases in volume as a sign of momentum
  - Integration of Price and Volume Indicators
    - Combine the high-low spread trends with volume momentum
      - Develop a composite factor that scores stocks based on combined trends
    - Synthesize the close-open relation with volume-to-amount ratio
      - Create a factor that reflects both the strength of price movement and the underlying trading activity
- Evaluation and Testing
  - Validate the generated factors using historical data
  - Test for predictive power in out-of-sample periods
  - Refine the factors based on performance metrics
  - Ensure interpretability and coherence in the final set of alpha factors
