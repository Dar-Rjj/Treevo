Thought: Synthesize Momentum, Volatility, and Market Sentiment Factors for Predictive Alpha Generation

Sub-Thought 1: Calculate Simple Moving Averages (SMA) to Capture Momentum
  - Sub-Thought 1.1: Use closing prices to calculate 5-day SMA
  - Sub-Thought 1.2: Use closing prices to calculate 20-day SMA
  - Sub-Thought 1.3: Create a momentum indicator by subtracting 20-day SMA from 5-day SMA

Sub-Thought 2: Analyze Price Volatility Using High, Low, and Close Prices
  - Sub-Thought 2.1: Compute daily true range as the maximum of (high - low), |high - previous close|, and |low - previous close|
  - Sub-Thought 2.2: Calculate average true range over a 14-day period
  - Sub-Thought 2.3: Generate a short-term volatility measure by computing the 7-day average true range
  - Sub-Thought 2.4: Formulate a ratio of short-term volatility (7-day ATR) to long-term volatility (14-day ATR) to identify periods of increasing or decreasing volatility

Sub-Thought 3: Evaluate Volume Changes to Assess Market Sentiment
  - Sub-Thought 3.1: Calculate the percentage change in volume compared to the previous day
  - Sub-Thought 3.2: Create a smoothed 5-day volume change indicator by taking the average of daily volume changes
  - Sub-Thought 3.3: Determine if current volume is above or below the 5-day average volume to interpret investor interest
  - Sub-Thought 3.4: Combine volume trend with price movement (e.g., positive price change and above-average volume)

Sub-Thought 4: Incorporate Trading Range Analysis for Additional Insight
  - Sub-Thought 4.1: Measure the distance between the day's high and low as the daily trading range
  - Sub-Thought 4.2: Compute a 10-day moving average of the daily trading range
  - Sub-Thought 4.3: Compare the current day's trading range against its 10-day moving average to detect potential breakout signals
  - Sub-Thought 4.4: Integrate price action with trading range; for example, if the price closes near the day's high and the trading range exceeds its 10-day average, it could indicate bullish momentum

Sub-Thought 5: Investigate the Impact of Open and Close Prices on the Next Day's Return
  - Sub-Thought 5.1: Calculate the overnight return by finding the percent change from today’s close to tomorrow’s open
  - Sub-Thought 5.2: Create a factor that combines the overnight return with the day's intraday return (percent change from open to close)
  - Sub-Thought 5.3: Formulate a signal based on the sign and magnitude of the combined return to forecast short-term directional bias

Sub-Thought 6: Compute Intraday High-Low Spread and Momentum
  - Sub-Thought 6.1: Subtract Low price from High price to get the intraday high-low spread
  - Sub-Thought 6.2: Collect intraday high-low spreads over past N days
  - Sub-Thought 6.3: Compute the average intraday high-low spread
  - Sub-Thought 6.4: Compare the current intraday high-low spread with the average
    - Assign a positive score if the current spread is greater than the average
    - Assign a negative score if the current spread is less than the average
  - Sub-Thought 6.5: Adjust the score by multiplying it with the current volume

Sub-Thought 7: Enhance Market Sentiment Analysis
  - Sub-Thought 7.1: Calculate the daily range by subtracting the Low price from the High price
  - Sub-Thought 7.2: Collect daily ranges over past M days
  - Sub-Thought 7.3: Compute the average daily range
  - Sub-Thought 7.4: Compare the current daily range with the average daily range
    - Assign a positive score if the current range is greater than the average
    - Assign a negative score if the current range is less than the average
  - Sub-Thought 7.5: Integrate the open-price and close-price movement
    - Calculate the open to close price difference
    - Sum up the open to close price differences over the period
    - Calculate the open to low price difference
    - Sum up the open to low price differences over the period

Sub-Thought 8: Combine All Factors
  - Sub-Thought 8.1: Weighted Sum
    - Multiply the high-low momentum score by a
