Thought: Constructing Alpha Factors from Price and Volume Data
- Thought: Trend Following Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover
    - Sub-Thought: Compute EMA(12, t) and EMA(26, t) for each day t. Factor = EMA(12, t) - EMA(26, t)
- Thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) Difference
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate SMA(50, t) and SMA(200, t). Factor = Close(t) - SMA(200, t)
  - Sub-Thought: Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Sub-Thought: Compute ROC(n, t) as (Close(t) - Close(t-n)) / Close(t-n), where n can be 10, 50 or 100.
- Thought: Volume Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: On-Balance-Volume (OBV)
    - Sub-Thought: If Close(t) > Close(t-1), OBV(t) = OBV(t-1) + Volume(t). If Close(t) < Close(t-1), OBV(t) = OBV(t-1) - Volume(t). Otherwise, OBV(t) = OBV(t-1).
  - Sub-Thought: Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Sub-Thought: VWAP(t) = Σ(Volume(day) * TypicalPrice(day)) / Σ(Volume(day)), up to day t. TypicalPrice = (High + Low + Close) / 3. Factor = Close(t) - VWAP(t)
- Thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: True Range (TR)
    - Sub-Thought: TR(t) = max[High(t) - Low(t), abs(High(t) - Close(t-1)), abs(Low(t) - Close(t-1))]
  - Sub-Thought: ATR over a period
    - Sub-Thought: Compute ATR(n, t) as the average of TR values over the last n days. This serves as a factor indicating stock volatility.
- Thought: Oscillators
  - Sub-Thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Sub-Thought: Calculate RSI(n, t) based on the ratio of average gains to average losses over the last n periods.
  - Sub-Thought: Stochastic Oscillator
    - Sub-Thought: %K(t) = (Close(t) - LowestLow(t,n)) / (HighestHigh(t,n) - LowestLow(t,n)) * 100. Consider %K as a factor.

This thought tree outlines a variety of alpha factors that can be derived from price and volume data, focusing on trend, momentum, volume, volatility, and oscillators, all without relying on normalization or global statistics, adhering to the constraints provided.
