Thought: Synthesize momentum, volatility, and volume-based factors with enhanced market sentiment and intraday volatility for robust alpha prediction

Sub-Thought 1: Calculate simple moving averages (SMA) to capture momentum
  - Sub-Thought 1.1: Use closing prices to calculate 5-day SMA
  - Sub-Thought 1.2: Use closing prices to calculate 20-day SMA
  - Sub-Thought 1.3: Create a momentum indicator by subtracting 20-day SMA from 5-day SMA

Sub-Thought 2: Analyze price volatility using high, low, and close prices
  - Sub-Thought 2.1: Compute daily true range as the maximum of (high - low), |high - previous close|, and |low - previous close|
  - Sub-Thought 2.2: Calculate average true range over a 14-day period
  - Sub-Thought 2.3: Generate a short-term volatility measure by computing the 7-day average true range
  - Sub-Thought 2.4: Formulate a ratio of short-term volatility (7-day ATR) to long-term volatility (14-day ATR) to identify periods of increasing or decreasing volatility

Sub-Thought 3: Evaluate volume changes to assess market sentiment
  - Sub-Thought 3.1: Calculate the percentage change in volume compared to the previous day
  - Sub-Thought 3.2: Create a smoothed 5-day volume change indicator by taking the average of daily volume changes
  - Sub-Thought 3.3: Determine if current volume is above or below the 5-day average volume to interpret investor interest
  - Sub-Thought 3.4: Combine volume trend with price movement (e.g., positive price change and above-average volume)

Sub-Thought 4: Incorporate trading range analysis for additional insight
  - Sub-Thought 4.1: Measure the distance between the day's high and low as the daily trading range
  - Sub-Thought 4.2: Compute a 10-day moving average of the daily trading range
  - Sub-Thought 4.3: Compare the current day's trading range against its 10-day moving average to detect potential breakout signals
  - Sub-Thought 4.4: Integrate price action with trading range; for example, if the price closes near the day's high and the trading range exceeds its 10-day average, it could indicate bullish momentum

Sub-Thought 5: Investigate the impact of open and close prices on the next day's return
  - Sub-Thought 5.1: Calculate the overnight return by finding the percent change from today’s close to tomorrow’s open
  - Sub-Thought 5.2: Create a factor that combines the overnight return with the day's intraday return (percent change from open to close)
  - Sub-Thought 5.3: Formulate a signal based on the sign and magnitude of the combined return to forecast short-term directional bias

Sub-Thought 6: Combine multiple factors to generate a composite alpha signal
  - Sub-Thought 6.1: Integrate the momentum, volatility, and volume factors into a single composite score
  - Sub-Thought 6.2: Weigh each factor based on its historical predictive power and market conditions
  - Sub-Thought 6.3: Create a final alpha signal by combining the weighted scores to predict future stock returns

Sub-Thought 7: Enhance Intraday Analysis
  - Sub-Thought 7.1: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread
    - Sub-Thought 7.1.1: Use High price
    - Sub-Thought 7.1.2: Subtract Low price
  - Sub-Thought 7.2: Compute Average Intraday High-Low Spread
    - Sub-Thought 7.2.1: Collect Intraday High-Low Spreads over past N days
    - Sub-Thought 7.2.2: Compute the average
  - Sub-Thought 7.3: Compute High-Low Momentum Score
    - Sub-Thought 7.3.1: Compare current Intraday High-Low Spread with Average
      - Sub-Thought 7.3.1.1: Assign a positive score if current spread > average
      - Sub-Thought 7.3.1.2: Assign a negative score if current spread < average
    - Sub-Thought 7.3.2: Adjust by Volume
      - Sub-Thought 7.3.2.1: Use Volume
      - Sub-Thought 7.3.2.2: Multiply High-Low Momentum Score by Volume

Sub-Thought 8: Incorporate Open-Price Movement
