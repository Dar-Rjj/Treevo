Thought: Crossover Approach for Momentum, Volatility, and Volume Analysis with Enhanced Market Sentiment and Intraday Dynamics

Sub-Thought 1: High-Low Price and Volume-Weighted Momentum
  ├── Calculate Daily High-Low Ratio
  │   ├── Use High price
  │   └── Use Low price
  └── Volume-Weighted Rolling Average of High-Low Ratios
      ├── Set Rolling Window (e.g., 10 days)
      ├── Compute the Volume-Weighted Mean
      │   ├── Use High-Low Ratios from Previous Days
      │   ├── Use Volume from Previous Days
      │   └── Calculate Weighted Average
      └── Apply Exponential Smoothing
          └── Set Smoothing Factor (e.g., 0.2)

Sub-Thought 2: Simple Moving Averages and Momentum
  ├── Use closing prices to calculate 5-day SMA
  ├── Use closing prices to calculate 20-day SMA
  └── Create a momentum indicator by subtracting 20-day SMA from 5-day SMA

Sub-Thought 3: Price Volatility Analysis
  ├── Compute daily true range as the maximum of (high - low), |high - previous close|, and |low - previous close|
  ├── Calculate average true range over a 14-day period
  ├── Generate a short-term volatility measure by computing the 7-day average true range
  └── Formulate a ratio of short-term volatility (7-day ATR) to long-term volatility (14-day ATR)

Sub-Thought 4: Evaluate Volume Changes for Market Sentiment
  ├── Calculate the percentage change in volume compared to the previous day
  ├── Create a smoothed 5-day volume change indicator by taking the average of daily volume changes
  ├── Determine if current volume is above or below the 5-day average volume
  └── Combine volume trend with price movement (e.g., positive price change and above-average volume)

Sub-Thought 5: Trading Range and Open-Price Movement Analysis
  ├── Measure the distance between the day's high and low as the daily trading range
  ├── Compute a 10-day moving average of the daily trading range
  ├── Compare the current day's trading range against its 10-day moving average
  ├── Enhance Market Sentiment Analysis
  │   ├── Calculate Daily Range
  │   │   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
  │   ├── Compute Average Daily Range
  │   │   ├── Collect Daily Ranges over past M days
  │   │   └── Compute the average
  │   ├── Calculate Range Momentum
  │   │   ├── Compare current Daily Range with Average Daily Range
  │   │   │   ├── Assign positive score if current range > average
  │   │   │   └── Assign negative score if current range < average
  │   └── Integrate Open-Price and Close-Price Movement
  │       ├── Calculate Open to Close Price Difference
  │       │   ├── Subtract Open price from Close price
  │       └── Sum up the Open to Close Price Differences over the period

Sub-Thought 6: Intraday Price Volatility and Open-High Spread
  ├── Calculate Intraday Price Volatility
  │   ├── Compute Standard Deviation of Intraday Prices (Open, High, Low, Close)
  │   └── Use a rolling window of P days
  ├── Compute Price Volatility Score
  │   ├── Compare current Intraday Price Volatility with Average
  │   │   ├── Assign positive score if current volatility > average
  │   │   └── Assign negative score if current volatility < average
  │   └── Adjust by Volume
  │       ├── Multiply Price Volatility Score by Volume
  ├── Calculate Intraday Open-High Spread
  │   ├── Subtract Open price from High price
  ├── Compute Average Intraday Open-High Spread
  │   ├── Collect Intraday Open-High Spreads over past Q days
  │   └── Compute the average
  ├── Compute Open-High Momentum Score
  │   ├── Compare current Intraday Open-High Spread with Average
  │   │   ├── Assign positive score if current spread > average
  │   │   └── Assign negative score if current spread < average
  │   └── Adjust by Volume
  │       ├── Multiply Open-High Momentum Score by Volume

Sub-Thought 7: Combine Factors
    ├── Weighted Sum
    │   ├── Multiply High-Low Momentum Score by a Coefficient
    │   ├── Multiply Price Momentum by a Coefficient
    │   ├── Multiply Volume Trend by a Coefficient
    │   ├── Multiply Range Momentum by a Coefficient
