Thought: Analyze price and volume trends to identify potential stock return predictors
  - Sub-thought: Calculate moving averages of closing prices for short (e.g., 5-day) and long (e.g., 20-day) periods
    - Sub-thought: Compute the difference between the short and long moving averages as a trend indicator
  - Sub-thought: Calculate average daily trading volume over a specific period (e.g., 14 days)
    - Sub-thought: Compare current day's volume with the average volume to determine relative activity
  - Sub-thought: Measure volatility by calculating the standard deviation of daily returns over a set window (e.g., 20 days)
    - Sub-thought: Use the ratio of the high-low range to the close price as an additional volatility measure
  - Sub-thought: Calculate momentum by finding the percentage change in closing price from a past period (e.g., 1 month)
    - Sub-thought: Consider the rate of change in momentum over consecutive periods for acceleration
  - Sub-thought: Evaluate the pattern of candlesticks (open, high, low, close) for bullish or bearish signals
    - Sub-thought: Count the number of consecutive days with higher closes (uptrend) or lower closes (downtrend)
  - Sub-thought: Identify significant price levels (support and resistance) using historical highs and lows
    - Sub-thought: Calculate the distance of the current close to these support and resistance levels
  - Sub-thought: Analyze the relationship between traded amount and volume to infer market sentiment
    - Sub-thought: Compute the average trade size and compare it with the overall volume
