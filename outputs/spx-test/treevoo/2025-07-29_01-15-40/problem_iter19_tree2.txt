Thought: Explore price and volume data to identify trends and patterns for alpha factor generation
  Sub-Thought: Analyze price movements to generate alpha factors
    Sub-Thought: Use moving averages of prices to capture trend information
      Sub-Thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over a short period
        Sub-Thought: Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices over a long period
          Sub-Thought: Generate a momentum signal by comparing the short-term SMA with the long-term SMA
            Sub-Thought: If the short-term SMA is above the long-term SMA, assign a positive score; if below, assign a negative score
    Sub-Thought: Leverage price change to create signals
      Sub-Thought: Calculate the percentage change in closing prices from one day to the next
        Sub-Thought: Generate a signal based on the direction and magnitude of the price change
          Sub-Thought: If the percentage change is positive, assign a positive score; if negative, assign a negative score
  Sub-Thought: Analyze volume to identify unusual trading activity
    Sub-Thought: Compare daily volume with a moving average of volume
      Sub-Thought: Calculate the average volume over a recent period
        Sub-Thought: Identify days where the current volume is significantly higher or lower than the average volume
          Sub-Thought: If the current volume is significantly higher, assign a positive score; if significantly lower, assign a negative score
  Sub-Thought: Combine price and volume signals to create a composite alpha factor
    Sub-Thought: Sum the scores from price and volume signals
      Sub-Thought: Assign a final score based on the sum of the individual scores
