Combined High-Low Price Momentum and Volume Interaction Alpha Factor
├── Calculate Daily High-Low Ratio
│   ├── Use High price
│   └── Use Low price
├── Calculate Rolling Average of High-Low Ratios
│   ├── Set Rolling Window (e.g., 10 days)
│   └── Calculate the Mean of High-Low Ratios
│       ├── Use High-Low Ratios from Previous Days
│       └── Compute the Average
├── Calculate 5-Day Momentum
│   └── Compute (Close_t - Close_(t-5))
├── Calculate 20-Day Volume Moving Average
│   └── Compute the average of the last 20 days
├── Compute Volume Deviation from MA
│   └── Subtract 20-Day Volume Moving Average
├── Combine Momentum and Volume Synchronicity
│   └── Compute the product: 5-Day Momentum * Volume Deviation
├── Apply Exponential Smoothing to Combined Synchronicity
│   └── Reduce noise in the combined synchronicity
├── Calculate Final Factor
│   ├── Add Weighted Sum of Smoothed Synchronicity and Rolling High-Low Ratios
│   └── Adjust for Market Sentiment
│       ├── Incorporate High-Low Range
│       └── Adjust by 10-Day Standard Deviation of High-Low Ratios
└── Output Final Alpha Factor
