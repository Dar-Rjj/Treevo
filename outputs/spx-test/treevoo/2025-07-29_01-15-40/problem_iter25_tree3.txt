Thought: Constructing Alpha Factors from Price and Volume Data
- Thought: Trend Following Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover
    - Factor = EMA(12, t) - EMA(26, t)
  - Sub-Thought: Linear Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) Crossover
    - Factor = LWMA(14, t) - LWMA(28, t)
- Thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) Difference
    - Factor = Close(t) - SMA(200, t)
  - Sub-Thought: Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Factor = (Close(t) - Close(t-n)) / Close(t-n), where n can be 10, 50 or 100
  - Sub-Thought: Momentum
    - Factor = Close(t) - Close(t-n), where n can be 10, 50 or 100
- Thought: Volume Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: On-Balance-Volume (OBV)
    - If Close(t) > Close(t-1), OBV(t) = OBV(t-1) + Volume(t). If Close(t) < Close(t-1), OBV(t) = OBV(t-1) - Volume(t). Otherwise, OBV(t) = OBV(t-1).
  - Sub-Thought: Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - Factor = Close(t) - VWAP(t)
  - Sub-Thought: Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - Factor = CMF(n, t)
- Thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: True Range (TR)
    - TR(t) = max[High(t) - Low(t), abs(High(t) - Close(t-1)), abs(Low(t) - Close(t-1))]
  - Sub-Thought: ATR over a period
    - Factor = ATR(n, t)
  - Sub-Thought: Bollinger Bands
    - Factor = (Close(t) - SMA(20, t)) / (BBandUpper(t) - BBandLower(t))
- Thought: Oscillators
  - Sub-Thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Calculate RSI(n, t) based on the ratio of average gains to average losses over the last n periods.
  - Sub-Thought: Stochastic Oscillator
    - Factor = %K(t) = (Close(t) - LowestLow(t,n)) / (HighestHigh(t,n) - LowestLow(t,n)) * 100
  - Sub-Thought: Ultimate Oscillator
    - Factor = UO(t) = (4 * BP7 + 2 * BP14 + BP28) / (4 * TR7 + 2 * TR14 + TR28)

This improved tree has been pruned by removing redundant descriptions and ensuring that each factor is clearly defined.
