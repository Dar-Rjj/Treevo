Thought: Constructing Alpha Factors from Price and Volume Data
- Thought: Trend Following Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover
    - Factor = EMA(12, t) - EMA(26, t)
  - Sub-Thought: Linear Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) Crossover
    - Factor = LWMA(14, t) - LWMA(28, t)
- Thought: Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Factor = ROC(n, t) where n can be 10, 50, or 100
  - Sub-Thought: Momentum
    - Factor = Close(t) - Close(t-n) where n can be 10, 50, or 100
- Thought: Volume Analysis
  - Sub-Thought: On-Balance-Volume (OBV)
    - If Close(t) > Close(t-1), OBV(t) = OBV(t-1) + Volume(t). If Close(t) < Close(t-1), OBV(t) = OBV(t-1) - Volume(t). Otherwise, OBV(t) = OBV(t-1).
  - Sub-Thought: Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - VWAP(t) = Σ(Volume(day) * TypicalPrice(day)) / Σ(Volume(day)), up to day t. TypicalPrice = (High + Low + Close) / 3. Factor = Close(t) - VWAP(t)
  - Sub-Thought: Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
    - CMF(n, t) = Σ(MoneyFlowMultiplier(day) * Volume(day)) / Σ(Volume(day)), up to day t. MoneyFlowMultiplier = (Close(day) - Low(day)) - (High(day) - Close(day)) / (High(day) - Low(day)). Factor = CMF(n, t)
- Thought: Volatility Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: ATR over a period
    - Factor = ATR(n, t) as the average of TR values over the last n days
  - Sub-Thought: Bollinger Bands
    - BBandUpper(t) = SMA(20, t) + 2 * StdDev(20, t). BBandLower(t) = SMA(20, t) - 2 * StdDev(20, t). Factor = (Close(t) - SMA(20, t)) / (BBandUpper(t) - BBandLower(t))
- Thought: Oscillators
  - Sub-Thought: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Factor = RSI(n, t) based on the ratio of average gains to average losses over the last n periods
  - Sub-Thought: Stochastic Oscillator
    - %K(t) = (Close(t) - LowestLow(t,n)) / (HighestHigh(t,n) - LowestLow(t,n)) * 100. Factor = %K
  - Sub-Thought: Ultimate Oscillator
    - UO(t) = (4 * BP7 + 2 * BP14 + BP28) / (4 * TR7 + 2 * TR14 + TR28). BPn = Max(0, Close(t) - Min(Low(t-n+1:t))). TRn = Max(High(t-n+1:t)) - Min(Low(t-n+1:t)). Factor = UO(t)
