```python
import pandas as pd

def heuristics_v2(df):
    """
    This function generates a novel and interpretable alpha factor based on the given DataFrame.
    The input DataFrame should have (date) as index and (open, high, low, close, volume) as columns.
    
    The heuristic is based on the idea that the relative strength of closing prices to the average of 
    high and low prices can be an indicator of the stock's future performance. To capture this, we 
    calculate the ratio of the close price to the average of high and low prices for each day.
    
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame with (date) as index and (open, high, low, close, volume) as columns.
    
    Returns:
    pd.Series: A Series with (date) as index and the calculated factor values.

    factor_values = df['close'] / avg_high_low
