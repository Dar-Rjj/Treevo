Thought: Crossover Approach for Momentum, Volatility, and Volume Analysis

Sub-Thought 1: High-Low Price Momentum with Volume-Weighted Component
  ├── Calculate Daily High-Low Ratio
  │   ├── Use High price
  │   └── Use Low price
  └── Volume-Weighted Rolling Average of High-Low Ratios
      ├── Set Rolling Window (e.g., 10 days)
      ├── Compute the Volume-Weighted Mean
      │   ├── Use High-Low Ratios from Previous Days
      │   ├── Use Volume from Previous Days
      │   └── Calculate Weighted Average
      └── Apply Exponential Smoothing
          └── Set Smoothing Factor (e.g., 0.2)

Sub-Thought 2: Simple Moving Averages and Momentum
  ├── Use closing prices to calculate 5-day SMA
  ├── Use closing prices to calculate 20-day SMA
  ├── Create a momentum indicator by subtracting 20-day SMA from 5-day SMA
  └── Combine with High-Low Ratio Momentum
      ├── Use 5-day and 20-day SMA to adjust the High-Low Ratio
      └── Integrate with Volume-Weighted Rolling Average

Sub-Thought 3: Price Volatility Analysis
  ├── Compute daily true range as the maximum of (high - low), |high - previous close|, and |low - previous close|
  ├── Calculate average true range over a 14-day period
  ├── Generate a short-term volatility measure by computing the 7-day average true range
  ├── Formulate a ratio of short-term volatility (7-day ATR) to long-term volatility (14-day ATR)
  └── Integrate with High-Low Ratio
      ├── Adjust High-Low Ratio using 7-day and 14-day ATR
      └── Use this adjusted ratio in the Volume-Weighted Rolling Average

Sub-Thought 4: Evaluate Volume Changes for Market Sentiment
  ├── Calculate the percentage change in volume compared to the previous day
  ├── Create a smoothed 5-day volume change indicator by taking the average of daily volume changes
  ├── Determine if current volume is above or below the 5-day average volume
  ├── Combine volume trend with price movement (e.g., positive price change and above-average volume)
  └── Integrate with Momentum and Volatility
      ├── Use the 5-day volume change indicator to adjust the High-Low Ratio
      └── Incorporate in the Volume-Weighted Rolling Average

Sub-Thought 5: Trading Range Analysis
  ├── Measure the distance between the day's high and low as the daily trading range
  ├── Compute a 10-day moving average of the daily trading range
  ├── Compare the current day's trading range against its 10-day moving average
  ├── Integrate price action with trading range; e.g., if the price closes near the day's high and the trading range exceeds its 10-day average, it could indicate bullish momentum
  └── Combine with High-Low Ratio and Volume
      ├── Use the 10-day moving average of the trading range to adjust the High-Low Ratio
      └── Integrate in the Volume-Weighted Rolling Average

Sub-Thought 6: Open and Close Prices Impact on Next Day's Return
  ├── Calculate the overnight return by finding the percent change from today’s close to tomorrow’s open
  ├── Create a factor that combines the overnight return with the day's intraday return (percent change from open to close)
  ├── Formulate a signal based on the sign and magnitude of the combined return to forecast short-term directional bias
  └── Integrate with Other Factors
      ├── Use the combined return to adjust the High-Low Ratio
      └── Incorporate in the Volume-Weighted Rolling Average
