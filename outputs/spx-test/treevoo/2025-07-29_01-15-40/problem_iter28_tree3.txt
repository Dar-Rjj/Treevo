Thought: Crossover Approach for Momentum, Volatility, and Volume Analysis

Sub-Thought 1: High-Low Price Momentum with Volume-Weighted Component
  ├── Calculate Daily High-Low Ratio
  │   ├── Use High price
  │   └── Use Low price
  └── Volume-Weighted Rolling Average of High-Low Ratios
      ├── Set Rolling Window (e.g., 10 days)
      ├── Compute the Volume-Weighted Mean
      │   ├── Use High-Low Ratios from Previous Days
      │   ├── Use Volume from Previous Days
      │   └── Calculate Weighted Average
      └── Apply Exponential Smoothing
          └── Set Smoothing Factor (e.g., 0.2)

Sub-Thought 2: Simple Moving Averages and Momentum
  ├── Use closing prices to calculate 5-day SMA
  ├── Use closing prices to calculate 20-day SMA
  └── Create a momentum indicator by subtracting 20-day SMA from 5-day SMA

Sub-Thought 3: Price Volatility Analysis
  ├── Compute daily true range as the maximum of (high - low), |high - previous close|, and |low - previous close|
  ├── Calculate average true range over a 14-day period
  ├── Generate a short-term volatility measure by computing the 7-day average true range
  └── Formulate a ratio of short-term volatility (7-day ATR) to long-term volatility (14-day ATR)

Sub-Thought 4: Evaluate Volume Changes for Market Sentiment
  ├── Calculate the percentage change in volume compared to the previous day
  ├── Create a smoothed 5-day volume change indicator by taking the average of daily volume changes
  ├── Determine if current volume is above or below the 5-day average volume
  └── Combine volume trend with price movement (e.g., positive price change and above-average volume)

Sub-Thought 5: Trading Range Analysis
  ├── Measure the distance between the day's high and low as the daily trading range
  ├── Compute a 10-day moving average of the daily trading range
  └── Compare the current day's trading range against its 10-day moving average

Sub-Thought 6: Open and Close Prices Impact on Next Day's Return
  ├── Calculate the overnight return by finding the percent change from today’s close to tomorrow’s open
  └── Create a factor that combines the overnight return with the day's intraday return (percent change from open to close)
```
