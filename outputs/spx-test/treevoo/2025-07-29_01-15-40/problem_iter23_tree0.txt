Thought: Synthesize Momentum, Volatility, and Volume Factors for Predictive Alpha Generation

Sub-Thought 1: Calculate Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and High-Low Spread to Capture Momentum
  - Sub-Thought 1.1: Use closing prices to calculate 5-day SMA
  - Sub-Thought 1.2: Use closing prices to create a 20-day SMA
  - Sub-Thought 1.3: Create a momentum indicator by subtracting 20-day SMA from 5-day SMA
  - Sub-Thought 1.4: Calculate Intraday High-Low Spread by subtracting Low price from High price
  - Sub-Thought 1.5: Compute Average Intraday High-Low Spread over past N days
  - Sub-Thought 1.6: Compare current Intraday High-Low Spread with the Average to generate a High-Low Momentum Score
    - Sub-Thought 1.6.1: Assign positive score if current spread > average
    - Sub-Thought 1.6.2: Assign negative score if current spread < average
  - Sub-Thought 1.7: Adjust High-Low Momentum Score by multiplying it with Volume

Sub-Thought 2: Analyze Price Volatility and Daily Range
  - Sub-Thought 2.1: Compute daily true range as the maximum of (high - low), |high - previous close|, and |low - previous close|
  - Sub-Thought 2.2: Calculate average true range over a 14-day period
  - Sub-Thought 2.3: Generate a short-term volatility measure by computing the 7-day average true range
  - Sub-Thought 2.4: Formulate a ratio of short-term volatility (7-day ATR) to long-term volatility (14-day ATR)
  - Sub-Thought 2.5: Calculate Daily Range by subtracting Low price from High price
  - Sub-Thought 2.6: Compute Average Daily Range over past M days
  - Sub-Thought 2.7: Compare current Daily Range with Average Daily Range to generate a Range Momentum Score
    - Sub-Thought 2.7.1: Assign positive score if current range > average
    - Sub-Thought 2.7.2: Assign negative score if current range < average

Sub-Thought 3: Evaluate Volume Changes and Trends
  - Sub-Thought 3.1: Calculate the percentage change in volume compared to the previous day
  - Sub-Thought 3.2: Create a smoothed 5-day volume change indicator by taking the average of daily volume changes
  - Sub-Thought 3.3: Determine if current volume is above or below the 5-day average volume
  - Sub-Thought 3.4: Combine volume trend with price movement (e.g., positive price change and above-average volume)
  - Sub-Thought 3.5: Calculate Volume Trend by summing up the Volume Changes over a 5-day period

Sub-Thought 4: Incorporate Trading Range Analysis
  - Sub-Thought 4.1: Measure the distance between the day's high and low as the daily trading range
  - Sub-Thought 4.2: Compute a 10-day moving average of the daily trading range
  - Sub-Thought 4.3: Compare the current day's trading range against its 10-day moving average to detect potential breakout signals
  - Sub-Thought 4.4: Integrate price action with trading range; for example, if the price closes near the day's high and the trading range exceeds its 10-day average, it could indicate bullish momentum

Sub-Thought 5: Investigate the Impact of Open and Close Prices
  - Sub-Thought 5.1: Calculate the overnight return by finding the percent change from today’s close to tomorrow’s open
  - Sub-Thought 5.2: Create a factor that combines the overnight return with the day's intraday return (percent change from open to close)
  - Sub-Thought 5.3: Formulate a signal based on the sign and magnitude of the combined return to forecast short-term directional bias
  - Sub-Thought 5.4: Calculate Open to Close Price Difference by subtracting Open price from Close price
  - Sub-Thought 5.5: Sum up the Open to Close Price Differences over the period
  - Sub-Thought 5.6: Calculate Open to Low Price Difference by subtracting Open price from Low price
  - Sub-Thought 5.7: Sum up the Open to Low Price Differences over the period

Sub-Thought 6: Calculate Volume-Weighted Rolling Average of High-Low Ratios
  - Sub-Thought 6.1: Set a Rolling Window (
