Thought: Utilize raw (open, high, low, close) prices, amount, and volume to generate alpha factors.
    Thought: Calculate price movement indicators.
        Thought: Use the difference between daily high and low prices as a measure of volatility.
            Thought: Define Alpha Factor 1: Daily Range = High - Low
        Thought: Examine the closing price in relation to the day's range for insight into market sentiment.
            Thought: Define Alpha Factor 2: Close Position in Range = (Close - Low) / (High - Low)
    Thought: Leverage volume and amount data for additional insights.
        Thought: Consider the relationship between the volume of transactions and the trading amount to gauge interest and liquidity.
            Thought: Define Alpha Factor 3: Volume to Amount Ratio = Volume / Amount
        Thought: Evaluate the change in volume compared to the previous day to identify potential shifts in investor behavior.
            Thought: Define Alpha Factor 4: Volume Change = Volume[t] - Volume[t-1]

        Thought: Analyze the sequence of recent close prices to detect short-term trends.
            Thought: Define Alpha Factor 5: Price Momentum (over N days) = (Close[t] - Close[t-N]) / Close[t-N]
        Thought: Incorporate the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) without normalization or global statistics.
            Thought: Define Alpha Factor 6: MACD Line (using 12-day EMA and 26-day EMA) = EMA(Close, 12) - EMA(Close, 26)
            Thought: Define Signal Line (9-day EMA of the MACD line) = EMA(MACD, 9)
                Thought: Define Alpha Factor 7: MACD Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line
