Thought: Synthesize momentum, volatility, volume, and price action for a comprehensive alpha prediction model

Sub-Thought 1: Enhance momentum indicators using closing prices
  - Sub-Thought 1.1: Calculate 5-day simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices
  - Sub-Thought 1.2: Calculate 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of closing prices
  - Sub-Thought 1.3: Compute the difference between 5-day SMA and 20-day SMA to create a momentum indicator
  - Sub-Thought 1.4: Introduce a 50-day SMA to evaluate long-term trends
  - Sub-Thought 1.5: Formulate a long-term momentum factor by subtracting 50-day SMA from 20-day SMA

Sub-Thought 2: Incorporate multiple volatility measures
  - Sub-Thought 2.1: Compute daily true range as the maximum of (high - low), |high - previous close|, and |low - previous close|
  - Sub-Thought 2.2: Calculate 14-day average true range (ATR)
  - Sub-Thought 2.3: Generate a short-term volatility measure using the 7-day ATR
  - Sub-Thought 2.4: Compute the ratio of 7-day ATR to 14-day ATR to identify changes in volatility
  - Sub-Thought 2.5: Introduce a 28-day ATR to capture longer-term volatility
  - Sub-Thought 2.6: Formulate a long-term volatility factor by comparing 14-day ATR to 28-day ATR

Sub-Thought 3: Analyze volume and its impact on market sentiment
  - Sub-Thought 3.1: Calculate the percentage change in volume compared to the previous day
  - Sub-Thought 3.2: Create a smoothed 5-day volume change indicator
  - Sub-Thought 3.3: Determine if current volume is above or below the 5-day average volume
  - Sub-Thought 3.4: Combine volume trend with price movement (e.g., positive price change and above-average volume)
  - Sub-Thought 3.5: Introduce a 20-day volume moving average to evaluate long-term volume trends
  - Sub-Thought 3.6: Formulate a long-term volume factor by comparing current volume to the 20-day volume moving average

Sub-Thought 4: Integrate trading range analysis for additional insight
  - Sub-Thought 4.1: Measure the distance between the day's high and low as the daily trading range
  - Sub-Thought 4.2: Compute a 10-day moving average of the daily trading range
  - Sub-Thought 4.3: Compare the current day's trading range against its 10-day moving average
  - Sub-Thought 4.4: Integrate price action with trading range; for example, if the price closes near the day's high and the trading range exceeds its 10-day average, it could indicate bullish momentum
  - Sub-Thought 4.5: Compute a 20-day moving average of the daily trading range to capture longer-term trading range trends
  - Sub-Thought 4.6: Formulate a long-term trading range factor by comparing the 10-day and 20-day trading range moving averages

Sub-Thought 5: Investigate the impact of open and close prices on the next day's return
  - Sub-Thought 5.1: Calculate the overnight return by finding the percent change from today’s close to tomorrow’s open
  - Sub-Thought 5.2: Create a factor that combines the overnight return with the day's intraday return (percent change from open to close)
  - Sub-Thought 5.3: Formulate a signal based on the sign and magnitude of the combined return
  - Sub-Thought 5.4: Introduce a 5-day moving average of the combined return to smooth out short-term noise
  - Sub-Thought 5.5: Formulate a long-term return factor by comparing the 5-day moving average of the combined return to a 20-day moving average

Sub-Thought 6: Combine multiple factors to generate a composite alpha signal
  - Sub-Thought 6.1: Integrate the enhanced momentum, volatility, volume, and return factors into a single composite score
  - Sub-Thought 6.2: Weigh each factor based on its historical predictive power and current market conditions
  - Sub-Thought 6.3: Create a final alpha signal by combining the weighted scores to predict future stock returns
  - Sub-Thought 6.4: Introduce a dynamic weighting system that adjusts weights based
