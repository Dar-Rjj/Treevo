- Thought: Explore Momentum Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Calculate Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
    - Leaf: SMA(5 days) = Sum(close[-4:], close[t]) / 5
    - Leaf: SMA(10 days) = Sum(close[-9:], close[t]) / 10
    - Sub-Leaf: Difference between short-term and long-term SMA
      - Factor: SMA(5 days) - SMA(10 days)
  - Sub-Thought: Identify Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
    - Leaf: EMA(5 days) = (close[t] * 2/(1+5)) + (EMA[previous day] * (1-(2/(1+5))))
    - Leaf: EMA(10 days) = (close[t] * 2/(1+10)) + (EMA[previous day] * (1-(2/(1+10))))
    - Sub-Leaf: Difference between short-term and long-term EMA
      - Factor: EMA(5 days) - EMA(10 days)
- Thought: Investigate Volume Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Analyze Volume Change
    - Leaf: Volume Change = volume[t] - volume[t-1]
    - Factor: Volume Momentum = sign(volume[t] - volume[t-1])
  - Sub-Thought: Check for Volume Spikes
    - Leaf: Volume Spike = volume[t] > mean(volume[-5:])
    - Factor: Significant Volume Spike Indicator = if(volume[t] > 1.5 * mean(volume[-5:]), 1, 0)
- Thought: Utilize Price Pattern Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: Detect Bullish Engulfing Pattern
    - Leaf: open[t-1] > close[t-1]
    - Leaf: open[t] < close[t-1]
    - Leaf: close[t] > open[t-1]
    - Factor: Bullish Engulfing Signal = if(open[t-1] > close[t-1] and open[t] < close[t-1] and close[t] > open[t-1], 1, 0)
  - Sub-Thought: Detect Bearish Engulfing Pattern
    - Leaf: open[t-1] < close[t-1]
    - Leaf: open[t] > close[t-1]
    - Leaf: close[t] < open[t-1]
    - Factor: Bearish Engulfing Signal = if(open[t-1] < close[t-1] and open[t] > close[t-1] and close[t] < open[t-1], 1, 0)
- Thought: Evaluate Range Indicators
  - Sub-Thought: High-Low Range Analysis
    - Leaf: True Range = max(high[t] - low[t], abs(high[t] - close[t-1]), abs(low[t] - close[t-1]))
    - Factor: Average True Range(14 days) = sum(True Range[-13:], True Range[t]) / 14
  - Sub-Thought: Daily Range
    - Leaf: Daily Range = high[t] - low[t]
    - Factor: Daily Range Momentum = Daily Range[t] - Daily Range[t-1]
