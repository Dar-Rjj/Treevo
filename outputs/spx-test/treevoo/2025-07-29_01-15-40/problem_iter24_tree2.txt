Intraday High-Low Spread and Volume Momentum with Enhanced Open-Price and Close-Price Dynamics
├── Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Subtract Low price from High price
├── Average Intraday High-Low Spread
│   ├── Collect Intraday High-Low Spreads over past N days
│   └── Compute the average
├── High-Low Momentum Score
│   ├── Compare current Intraday High-Low Spread with Average
│   │   ├── Assign positive score if current spread > average
│   │   └── Assign negative score if current spread < average
│   └── Adjust by Volume
│       ├── Multiply High-Low Momentum Score by Volume
├── Price Momentum
│   ├── Determine Period (e.g., 5 days)
│   ├── Calculate Price Change
│   │   ├── Use Close price of current day
│   │   └── Use Close price of n days ago
│   └── Sum Up the Price Changes over the Period
├── Volume Trend
│   ├── Determine Period (e.g., 5 days)
│   ├── Calculate Volume Change
│   │   ├── Use Volume of current day
