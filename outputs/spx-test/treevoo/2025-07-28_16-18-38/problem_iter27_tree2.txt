- Explore Enhanced Price and Volume Dynamics for Alpha Generation
  - Analyze Advanced Price Movements and Volatility
    - Calculate Daily Return: (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
    - Calculate Daily Range: high_t - low_t
      - Use Daily Range as a Volatility Measure
      - Calculate Average True Range (ATR) over 14 days
        - Use ATR as a more robust volatility measure
      - Calculate High-Low Ratio: (high_t - close_t-1) / (low_t - close_t-1)
        - Use High-Low Ratio to measure price extremes
    - Calculate Distance to Long-Term Moving Average
      - Use 200-day moving average as the baseline
      - Compute the distance: close_t - 200-day MA
  - Utilize Trend Strength and Momentum
    - Short-term trend: 5-day moving average of close prices
    - Medium-term trend: 20-day moving average of close prices
    - Long-term trend: 50-day moving average of close prices
    - Trend Indicator: 5-day MA - 20-day MA
    - Simple Momentum Factor: Cumulative return over the last 5 days
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI) over 14 days
      - Use RSI to measure overbought or oversold conditions
    - Calculate Directional Movement Index (DMI) over 14 days
      - Use DMI to identify the strength of the trend
  - Examine Trading Volume and Amount Traded
    - Daily volume change: (volume_t - volume_t-1) / volume_t-1
    - Daily amount: close_t * volume_t
    - Daily amount change: (daily_amount_t - daily_amount_t-1) / daily_amount_t-1
    - Identify Days with Significantly Higher Volume
      - Compare volume to a recent average
      - Examine correlation between volume spikes and price movements
    - Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
      - Use OBV to measure buying and selling pressure
  - Construct Composite Factors
    - Price-Volume Momentum: (daily_return + daily_range / close_t-1) * daily_volume_change
    - Trend Confirmation: trend_indicator * daily_amount_change
    - Sentiment and Volatility: (average_5day_volatility + average_5day_daily_amount) * trend_indicator
    - Reversion to Mean: (close_t - 200-day MA) / 200-day MA
    - Reversal Indicator: current_low / previous_high
    - Open-Close Gap: open_t - close_t-1
      - Determine if the gap is positive or negative
      - Use the sign of the gap to predict the next day's direction
    - Integrated Volume and Trend: (trend_indicator * RSI) * (daily_volume_change + daily_amount_change)
    - Combined Momentum and Reversion: (simple_momentum_factor + reversion_to_mean) * (daily_range / close_t-1)
    - Trend and Volume Synchronization: (DMI * OBV) * (daily_volume_change + daily_amount_change)
  - Evaluate Factor Performance
    - Correlation with future returns
    - Backtest on historical data
