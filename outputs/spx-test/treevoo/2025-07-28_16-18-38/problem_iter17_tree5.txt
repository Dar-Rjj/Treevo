Synthesized Alpha Factor Combining Dynamic, Intraday, and Volume-Weighted Momentum with Long-Term Adjustment
├── Calculate Dynamic and Intraday Movement
│   ├── Select High and Low Prices
│   │   ├── Use High Price
│   │   └── Use Low Price
│   ├── Compute High-Low Spread (High - Low)
│   └── Combine with Close-Open Spread
│       ├── Use Close Price
│       └── Use Open Price
│       └── Subtract Open from Close
│   └── Sum High-Low and Close-Open Spreads
├── Synthesize Momentum Indicators
│   ├── Compute 7-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of High-to-Low Spread
│   │   ├── Use High-Low Spread
│   │   └── Use 7-day Span
│   └── Compute 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of High-to-Low Spread
│       ├── Use High-Low Spread
│       └── Use 21-day Span
│   └── Calculate Raw Momentum
│       ├── Compute High-Low Difference
│       └── Choose Lookback Period (e.g., 14 days)
│       ├── Compute Simple Moving Average (SMA)
│       └── Subtract SMA from Current Day's High-Low Difference
│   └── Apply Smoothing
│       ├── Choose Smoothing Factor (e.g., 0.2)
│       └── Apply Exponential Weighting
│   └── Combine Momentum Signals
│       ├── Compute the Ratio of 7-day EMA to 21-day EMA
│       └── Multiply by Intraday Movement
│   └── Accumulate the Combined Value Over N Days
│       ├── Keep a rolling sum over the last N days
│       └── Adjust for missing or non-trading days
│           └── Final Short-Term Momentum: The accumulated value as a measure of short-term price dynamics
├── Combine with Volume-Weighted Close Price
│   ├── Calculate Volume-Weighted Close Price (VWCP)
│   │   ├── Sum of (Close Price * Volume) over Lookback Period
│   │   └── Divide by Total Volume over Lookback Period
│   └── Combine Dynamic and Intraday Momentum with VWCP
│       ├── Compute the Product of Combined Momentum and VWCP
│       └── Introduce a Scaling Factor (e.g., 0.5)
│           └── Multiply the Product by the Scaling Factor
└── Long-Term Price Momentum Adjustment
    ├── 10 Day Average Close
    │   └── Compute the Mean of Last 10 Days' Close Prices
    └── Adjusted Close Difference
        └── Subtract 10 Day Average from Today's Close
    └── Combine with Short-Term Momentum
        ├── Divide Adjusted Close Difference by Accumulated Short-Term Momentum
        └── Introduce a Long-Term Scaling Factor (e.g., 0.3)
            └── Multiply the Result by the Long-Term Scaling Factor
