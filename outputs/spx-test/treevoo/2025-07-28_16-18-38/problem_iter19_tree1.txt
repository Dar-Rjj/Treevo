Synthesized Intraday and Dynamic Momentum with Enhanced Components
├── Intraday Movement
│   ├── High Low Spread: High - Low
│   └── Close Open Spread: Close - Open
│   └── Combine: (High - Low) + (Close - Open)
├── Momentum Indicators
│   ├── 7-day EMA of High-to-Low Range: EMA(High - Low, 7 days)
│   ├── 21-day EMA of High-to-Low Range: EMA(High - Low, 21 days)
│   └── Combine: EMA(High - Low, 7 days) / EMA(High - Low, 21 days) * Intraday Movement
└── Dynamic Momentum Adjustment
    ├── Volume-Weighted High-Low Difference: (High - Low) * Volume
    ├── 14-day SMA of Volume-Weighted High-Low Difference
    ├── Subtract: Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Difference - 14-day SMA
