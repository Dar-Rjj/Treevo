Thought: Synthesize alpha factors from price, volume, and dynamic momentum analysis with enhanced components
  Thought: Use open, high, low, close prices to identify patterns and trends
    Thought: Daily return - (Close - Open) / Open
    Thought: Intraday movement analysis
      Thought: High-Low spread - High - Low
      Thought: Close-Open spread - Close - Open
      Thought: Combined spreads - (High - Low) + (Close - Open)
    Thought: Explore moving averages to capture trend information
      Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close prices over a certain period
        Thought: SMA ratio - Close / SMA(Close)
      Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close prices for more recent data emphasis
        Thought: EMA ratio - Close / EMA(Close)
  Thought: Utilize volume and amount data to assess market liquidity and interest
    Thought: Volume ratio - Current Volume / SMA(Volume)
    Thought: Price-volume momentum - (Close - Open) * Volume
    Thought: Large trade indicator - If (Volume > 2 * SMA(Volume), 1, 0)
  Thought: Analyze dynamic momentum using high and low prices
    Thought: Calculate Dynamic Momentum
      Thought: Compute High-Low Difference
      Thought: Compute SMA of High-Low Difference
      Thought: Subtract SMA from Current Day's High-Low Difference
      Thought: Apply Exponential Weighting
    Thought: Transform to Bounded Range Without Normalization
      Thought: Add Offset to Shift to Positive Range
      Thought: Scale to Desired Range (e.g., 0 to 100) Using Multiplication
  Thought: Enhanced Components
    Thought: Intraday Volatility - Absolute Difference between Close and Open
    Thought: Volume Trend
      Thought: 5-day Moving Average of Volume
      Thought: Subtract 5-day Moving Average of Volume from Current Day's Volume
    Thought: Combine Enhanced Components
      Thought: Sum Intraday Volatility and Volume Trend
      Thought: Multiply by Combined Momentum Signals
  Thought: Combine factors for more robust signals
    Thought: Composite factor - (SMA ratio + EMA ratio + Intraday volatility + Volume ratio + Price-volume momentum + Large trade indicator + Dynamic Momentum) / 7
    Thought: Introduce a weighted composite factor
      Thought: Assign weights to each factor
      Thought: Calculate the weighted sum of factors
        Thought: Weighted Composite factor - (SMA ratio * SMA ratio weight + EMA ratio * EMA ratio weight + Intraday volatility * Intraday volatility weight + Volume ratio * Volume ratio weight + Price-volume momentum * Price-volume momentum weight + Large trade indicator * Large trade indicator weight + Dynamic Momentum * Dynamic Momentum weight)
  Thought: Final Alpha Factor
    Thought: Multiply Combined Momentum Signals by Adjusted Momentum
    Thought: Add Result to Combined Enhanced Components
