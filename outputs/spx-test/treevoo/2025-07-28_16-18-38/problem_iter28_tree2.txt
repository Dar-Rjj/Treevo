Thought: Synthesize alpha factors from price, volume, and dynamic momentum analysis
  Thought: Use open, high, low, close prices to identify patterns and trends
    Thought: Daily return - (Close - Open) / Open
    Thought: Intraday volatility - (High - Low) / Open
  Thought: Explore moving averages to capture trend information
    Thought: Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close prices over a certain period
      Thought: SMA ratio - Close / SMA(Close)
    Thought: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close prices for more recent data emphasis
      Thought: EMA ratio - Close / EMA(Close)
  Thought: Utilize volume and amount data to assess market liquidity and interest
    Thought: Volume ratio - Current Volume / SMA(Volume)
    Thought: Price-volume momentum - (Close - Open) * Volume
    Thought: Large trade indicator - If (Volume > 2 * SMA(Volume), 1, 0)
  Thought: Analyze dynamic momentum using high and low prices
    Thought: Calculate Moving Average of High-Low Difference
      Thought: Compute High-Low Difference
      Thought: Choose Lookback Period (e.g., 14 days)
      Thought: Compute Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    Thought: Calculate Raw Momentum
      Thought: Subtract SMA from Current Day's High-Low Difference
    Thought: Apply Smoothing
      Thought: Choose Smoothing Factor (e.g., 0.2)
      Thought: Apply Exponential Weighting
    Thought: Transform to Bounded Range Without Normalization
      Thought: Add Offset to Shift to Positive Range
        Thought: Set Minimum Value (e.g., 0)
        Thought: Compute Maximum Possible Value
      Thought: Scale to Desired Range (e.g., 0 to 100) Using Multiplication
  Thought: Combine factors for more robust signals
    Thought: Composite factor - (SMA ratio + EMA ratio + Intraday volatility + Volume ratio + Price-volume momentum + Large trade indicator + Dynamic Momentum) / 7
