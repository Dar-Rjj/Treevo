│   └── Weight by Volume (Return * Volume)
├── Incorporate Previous Day's Close-to-Open Movement
│   ├── Compute Close-to-Open Return (Close_prev - Open_curr)
│   └── Sum Volume-Weighted High-to-Low Return and Close-to-Open Return
│       └── Short-Term Combined Momentum
├── Calculate Moving Average of High-to-Low Difference
│   ├── Compute High-Low Difference
│   ├── Choose Lookback Period (e.g., 14 days)

│   │   └── Divide by Total Volume over Lookback Period
│   └── Combine Dynamic Momentum and VWCP
│       ├── Compute the Product of Dynamic Momentum and VWCP
│       └── Introduce a Scaling Factor (e.g., 0.5)
│           └── Multiply the Product by the Scaling Factor
├── Long-Term Price Momentum Adjustment
│   ├── 10 Day Average Close
