    │   │   ├── Calculate the percentage change in volume from one day to the next
    │   ├── Evaluate the impact of volume spikes on price
    │   │   ├── Identify days with significantly higher volume compared to a recent average
    │   │   └── Examine the correlation between these spikes and price movements
    ├── Incorporate Transaction Amounts
    │   ├── Develop a Factor Linking Amount Traded to Stock Performance
    │   │   ├── Compare the amount traded on a given day to historical values
    │   │   │   ├── Calculate the average amount traded over a certain period (e.g., 30 days)
    │   │   │   └── Evaluate the deviation of the current day's amount from this average
    │   └── Combine Volume and Amount Data
    │       ├── Create a ratio of the amount traded to the volume
    │       └── Use this ratio as an indicator of the 'value' of transactions
    └── Construct Momentum and Reversion Indicators
