- Explore advanced price and volume dynamics
  - Calculate daily return: (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
  - Identify trend using moving averages
    - Short-term trend: 5-day MA of close prices
    - Long-term trend: 20-day MA of close prices
    - Trend indicator: 5-day MA - 20-day MA
  - Analyze daily volatility
    - Daily volatility: (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
  - Examine trading volume
    - Daily volume change: (volume_t - volume_t-1) / volume_t-1
  - Evaluate high and low range
    - Daily price range: (high_t - low_t)
- Construct focused composite factors
  - Price-volume momentum: (daily_return + daily_volatility) * daily_volume_change
  - Trend confirmation: trend_indicator * (close_t * volume_t - close_t-1 * volume_t-1) / (close_t-1 * volume_t-1)
  - Volatility-adjusted momentum: (daily_return / daily_volatility) * daily_volume_change
  - Range-adjusted volume: (daily_price_range / (high_t + low_t)) * (volume_t - volume_t-1)
- Incorporate open and close prices
  - Open-close price difference: (close_t - open_t) / open_t
  - High-low spread: (high_t - low_t) / (open_t + close_t)
- Use open, high, low, close prices to identify patterns and trends
  - Intraday return: (close_t - open_t) / open_t
  - Intraday volatility: (high_t - low_t) / close_t
  - Range over close: (high_t - low_t) / close_t
- Explore moving averages to capture trend information
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close prices over a certain period
    - SMA ratio: close_t / SMA(close, 20)
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close prices for more recent data emphasis
    - EMA ratio: close_t / EMA(close, 20)
  - Weighted Moving Average (WMA) of Close prices for different weights
    - WMA ratio: close_t / WMA(close, 20)
- Utilize volume and amount data to assess market liquidity and interest
  - Volume ratio: volume_t / SMA(volume, 20)
  - Price-volume momentum: (close_t - open_t) * volume_t
  - Large trade indicator: if (volume_t > 2 * SMA(volume, 20), 1, 0)
  - Money flow: (close_t - open_t) * amount_t
- Combine factors for more robust signals
  - Composite factor: (SMA ratio + EMA ratio + WMA ratio + Intraday volatility + Range over close + Volume ratio + Price-volume momentum + Large trade indicator + Money flow)
- Composite factors combining multiple indicators
  - Integrated momentum: (price_volume_momentum + volatility_adjusted_momentum) / 2
  - Combined trend and range: (trend_confirmation + range_adjusted_volume) / 2
- Evaluate factor performance
  - Correlation with future returns
  - Backtest on historical data
  - Out-of-sample testing
  - Forward-looking performance
