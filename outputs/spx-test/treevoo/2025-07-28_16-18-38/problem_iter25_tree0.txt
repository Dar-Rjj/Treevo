Thought 1: Synthesize Intraday, Dynamic Momentum, and Volume-Driven Alpha Factors
├── Thought 1.1: Enhanced Intraday Movement
│   ├── High Low Spread: High - Low
│   ├── Close Open Spread: Close - Open
│   └── Combined Intraday Indicator: (High - Low) + (Close - Open)
│   └── Price Direction: 
│       ├── If Close > Open, assign 1
│       └── If Close < Open, assign -1
├── Thought 1.2: Momentum Indicators with Volume Influence
│   ├── 7-day EMA of High-to-Low Range: EMA(High - Low, 7 days)
│   ├── 21-day EMA of High-to-Low Range: EMA(High - Low, 21 days)
│   ├── Momentum Ratio: EMA(High - Low, 7 days) / EMA(High - Low, 21 days)
│   └── Adjusted Momentum Factor: Momentum Ratio * (High - Low)
│   └── Volume-Weighted High-Low Difference: (High - Low) * Volume
│   └── Subtract: Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Diff - 14-day SMA
└── Thought 1.3: Volume and Amount Analysis for Alpha Generation
    ├── Volume Change: Percentage change in volume from one day to the next
    ├── Volume Spike: Identify days where volume is significantly higher than a recent average
    ├── Transaction Value: Ratio of amount traded to volume
    │   ├── Calculate the deviation of the current day's amount from this 30-day average
    └── Final Alpha Factor: 
        ├── Weighted Average of Adjusted Momentum and Volume-Weighted Momentum
        └── Incorporate Price Direction and Volume Spike
