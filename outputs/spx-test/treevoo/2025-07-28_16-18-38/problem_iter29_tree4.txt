Thought: Synthesize and enhance alpha factors by integrating advanced price, volume, and dynamic momentum analysis
  Thought: Use open, high, low, close prices to identify patterns and trends
    Thought: Daily return - (Close_t - Close_t-1) / Close_t-1
    Thought: Intraday volatility - (High - Low) / Open
  Thought: Explore moving averages to capture trend information
    Thought: Short-term trend: 5-day MA of close prices
      Thought: Short-term SMA ratio - Close / 5-day MA(Close)
    Thought: Long-term trend: 20-day MA of close prices
      Thought: Long-term SMA ratio - Close / 20-day MA(Close)
    Thought: Trend indicator: 5-day MA - 20-day MA
  Thought: Utilize volume and amount data to assess market liquidity and interest
    Thought: Volume ratio - Current Volume / 14-day SMA(Volume)
    Thought: Price-volume momentum - Daily return * (Volume_t - Volume_t-1) / Volume_t-1
    Thought: Large trade indicator - If (Volume > 2 * 14-day SMA(Volume), 1, 0)
  Thought: Analyze dynamic momentum using high and low prices
    Thought: Calculate Moving Average of High-Low Difference
      Thought: Compute High-Low Difference
      Thought: Choose Lookback Period (e.g., 14 days)
      Thought: Compute Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    Thought: Calculate Raw Momentum
      Thought: Subtract SMA from Current Day's High-Low Difference
    Thought: Apply Smoothing
      Thought: Choose Smoothing Factor (e.g., 0.2)
      Thought: Apply Exponential Weighting
    Thought: Transform to Bounded Range Without Normalization
      Thought: Add Offset to Shift to Positive Range
        Thought: Set Minimum Value (e.g., 0)
        Thought: Compute Maximum Possible Value
      Thought: Scale to Desired Range (e.g., 0 to 100) Using Multiplication
  Thought: Combine factors for more robust signals
    Thought: Composite factor - (Short-term SMA ratio + Long-term SMA ratio + Intraday volatility + Volume ratio + Price-volume momentum + Large trade indicator + Dynamic Momentum) / 7
    Thought: Introduce a weighted composite factor
      Thought: Assign weights to each factor
        Thought: Short-term SMA ratio weight
        Thought: Long-term SMA ratio weight
        Thought: Intraday volatility weight
        Thought: Volume ratio weight
        Thought: Price-volume momentum weight
        Thought: Large trade indicator weight
        Thought: Dynamic Momentum weight
      Thought: Calculate the weighted sum of factors
        Thought: Weighted Composite factor - (Short-term SMA ratio * Short-term SMA ratio weight + Long-term SMA ratio * Long-term SMA ratio weight + Intraday volatility * Intraday volatility weight + Volume ratio * Volume ratio weight + Price-volume momentum * Price-volume momentum weight + Large trade indicator * Large trade indicator weight + Dynamic Momentum * Dynamic Momentum weight)
    Thought: Trend confirmation: trend_indicator * (close_t * volume_t - close_t-1 * volume_t-1) / (close_t-1 * volume_t-1)
