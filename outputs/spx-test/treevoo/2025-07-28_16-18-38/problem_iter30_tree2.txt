Thought: Enhance Historical Price, Volume, and Momentum Analysis for Advanced Alpha Generation
├── Thought: Utilize Open, High, Low, Close Prices to Identify Intraday and Over Night Trends
│   ├── Daily Return: (Close - Previous Day's Close) / Previous Day's Close
│   ├── Intraday Volatility: (High - Low) / Open
│   ├── Combined Intraday Indicator: (High - Low) + (Close - Open)
│   └── Overnight Price Direction:
│       ├── If Close > Previous Day's Close, assign 1
│       └── If Close < Previous Day's Close, assign -1
├── Thought: Integrate Moving Averages to Capture Trend Information
│   ├── Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close prices over a certain period
│   │   └── SMA Ratio: Close / SMA(Close)
│   ├── Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close prices for more recent data emphasis
│   │   └── EMA Ratio: Close / EMA(Close)
│   ├── 7-day EMA of High-to-Low Range: EMA(High - Low, 7 days)
│   ├── 21-day EMA of High-to-Low Range: EMA(High - Low, 21 days)
│   └── Momentum Ratio: EMA(High - Low, 7 days) / EMA(High - Low, 21 days)
│   └── Adjusted Momentum Factor: Momentum Ratio * (High - Low) * (Close - Open)
├── Thought: Leverage Volume and Amount Data to Evaluate Market Dynamics
│   ├── Volume Ratio: Current Volume / SMA(Volume)
│   ├── Price-Volume Momentum: (Close - Open) * Volume
│   ├── Volume Change: Percentage change in volume from one day to the next
│   ├── Volume Spike: Identify days where volume is significantly higher than a recent average
│   ├── Transaction Value: Ratio of amount traded to volume
│   │   └── Calculate the deviation of the current day's transaction value from its 30-day moving average
│   └── Volume-Weighted High-Low Difference: (High - Low) * Volume
│   └── Subtract: Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Diff - 14-day SMA
└── Thought: Combine Factors for Comprehensive Signals
    ├── Composite factor: (SMA ratio + EMA ratio + Intraday volatility + Volume ratio + Price-volume momentum)
    └── Final Alpha Factor: 
        ├── Weighted Average of Adjusted Momentum and Volume-Weighted Momentum
        ├── Incorporate Overnight Price Direction and Volume Spike
        └── Adjust by Multiplying with the Overnight Price Direction
