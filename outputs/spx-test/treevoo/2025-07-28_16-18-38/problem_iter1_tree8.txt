Volume Weighted Exponential Moving Average (VWEMA) of Close Price Changes
├── Calculate Day-to-Day Log Return of Close Price
│   ├── Take natural logarithm of (Close price on day t / Close price on day t-1)
├── Compute Volume-Weighted Moving Sum
│   ├── Multiply the log return by the volume of day t
│   ├── Sum over a window of n days [t-n, t]
├── Compute Volume-Adjusted Factor
│   ├── Divide moving sum by the sum of volume over the same window [t-n, t]
└── Apply Exponential Smoothing
    ├── Assign weights exponentially decreasing from the most recent to the oldest in the window
    └── Multiply the volume-adjusted factor by the weight for each day and sum
