Thought: Create Alpha Factors Based on Historical Price and Volume Data
- Sub-thought: Develop Momentum-Based Alpha Factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the closing prices over a specified period
  - Sub-thought: Subtract the SMA from the current close price to find the deviation
- Sub-thought: Develop Reversal-Based Alpha Factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the ratio of the current low price to the previous high price
  - Sub-thought: Use this ratio as a signal for potential mean reversion
- Sub-thought: Develop Volume Shock Alpha Factor
  - Sub-thought: Measure the percentage change in volume from one day to the next
  - Sub-thought: Identify days with unusually large volume changes
- Sub-thought: Develop Price Range Alpha Factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the daily range (High - Low)
  - Sub-thought: Compute the average range over a certain period
  - Sub-thought: Compare today's range with the average range to detect volatility changes
- Sub-thought: Develop Open-Close Gap Alpha Factor
  - Sub-thought: Calculate the difference between the open and close prices
  - Sub-thought: Determine if the gap is positive or negative
  - Sub-thought: Use the sign of the gap to predict the next day's direction
