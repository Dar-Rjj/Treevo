Volume-Weighted True Range Momentum with Exponential Smoothing
├── Calculate Day-to-Day Log Return of Close Price
│   ├── Take natural logarithm of (Close price on day t / Close price on day t-1)
├── Calculate True Range
│   ├── Use High, Low, and Previous Close prices
├── Compute Volume-Weighted Moving Sum of Log Returns
│   ├── Multiply the log return by the volume of day t
│   ├── Sum over a window of n days [t-n, t]
├── Compute Average True Range (ATR)
│   ├── Sum of True Ranges over a window of n days [t-n, t]
│   └── Divide by number of days in the window
├── Incorporate Volume-Weighted Factor
│   ├── Divide moving sum of log returns by the sum of volume over the same window [t-n, t]
│   ├── Multiply ATR by the volume-weighted factor
└── Apply Exponential Smoothing
    ├── Assign weights exponentially decreasing from the most recent to the oldest in the window
    └── Multiply the volume-weighted factor and ATR by the weight for each day and sum
