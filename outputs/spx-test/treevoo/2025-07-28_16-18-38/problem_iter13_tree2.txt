Thought: Explore Momentum and Reversal Patterns
- Sub-thought: Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossovers
  - Sub-sub-thought: Use short-term SMA (e.g., 5 days) and long-term SMA (e.g., 20 days)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a binary factor: 1 if short-term SMA > long-term SMA, 0 otherwise
- Sub-thought: Identify Price Reversals Using RSI
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the Relative Strength Index (RSI) over a certain period (e.g., 14 days)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a binary factor: 1 if RSI < 30 (oversold), 0 if RSI > 70 (overbought)
- Sub-thought: Examine Volume and Price Trends
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the daily percentage change in volume
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a binary factor: 1 if volume increases and price decreases, 0 otherwise
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a binary factor: 1 if volume decreases and price increases, 0 otherwise
Thought: Analyze Volatility and Spread
- Sub-thought: Calculate Historical Volatility
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the standard deviation of daily returns over a certain period (e.g., 20 days)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a continuous factor using the historical volatility
- Sub-thought: Measure Intraday Volatility
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the range (high - low) for each day
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a continuous factor using the average intraday range over a certain period (e.g., 10 days)
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Bid-Ask Spread
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the bid-ask spread as (high - low)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a continuous factor using the average bid-ask spread over a certain period (e.g., 5 days)
Thought: Utilize Technical Indicators
- Sub-thought: Apply Bollinger Bands
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the upper and lower Bollinger Bands (2 standard deviations from the SMA)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a binary factor: 1 if price is above the upper band, 0 if below the lower band
- Sub-thought: Implement MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the MACD line (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compute the signal line (9-day EMA of the MACD line)
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a binary factor: 1 if MACD line crosses above the signal line, 0 if it crosses below
Thought: Consider Market Sentiment
- Sub-thought: Analyze Daily Returns
  - Sub-sub-thought: Calculate the daily return (close - open) / open
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a continuous factor using the daily return
- Sub-thought: Evaluate Open and Close Prices
  - Sub-sub-thought: Compare the open and close prices to identify bullish or bearish trends
  - Sub-sub-thought: Generate a binary factor: 1 if close > open, 0 if close < open
