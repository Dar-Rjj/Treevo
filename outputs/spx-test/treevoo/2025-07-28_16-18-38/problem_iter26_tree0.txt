Thought 1: Synthesize Intraday, Dynamic Momentum, and Volume-Driven Alpha Factors with Historical Trend Analysis
├── Thought 1.1: Enhanced Intraday Movement and Price Direction
│   ├── High Low Spread: High - Low
│   ├── Close Open Spread: Close - Open
│   └── Combined Intraday Indicator: (High - Low) + (Close - Open)
│   └── Price Direction: 
│       ├── If Close > Open, assign 1
│       └── If Close < Open, assign -1
├── Thought 1.2: Momentum Indicators with Volume Influence and Trend Information
│   ├── 7-day EMA of High-to-Low Range: EMA(High - Low, 7 days)
│   ├── 21-day EMA of High-to-Low Range: EMA(High - Low, 21 days)
│   ├── Momentum Ratio: EMA(High - Low, 7 days) / EMA(High - Low, 21 days)
│   └── Adjusted Momentum Factor: Momentum Ratio * (High - Low)
│   └── Volume-Weighted High-Low Difference: (High - Low) * Volume
│   └── 14-day SMA of Volume-Weighted High-Low Difference
│   └── Subtract: Current Day's Volume-Weighted High-Low Diff - 14-day SMA
│   └── Smoothed Momentum: Apply 0.2 smoothing factor to the subtraction result
│   └── Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close prices over a certain period
│   │   └── SMA ratio - Close / SMA(Close)
│   └── Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close prices for more recent data emphasis
│   │   └── EMA ratio - Close / EMA(Close)
│   └── Weighted Moving Average (WMA) of Close prices for different weights
│   │   └── WMA ratio - Close / WMA(Close)
└── Thought 1.3: Volume and Amount Analysis for Alpha Generation
    ├── Volume Change: Percentage change in volume from one day to the next
    ├── Volume Spike: Identify days where volume is significantly higher than a recent average
    ├── Transaction Value: Ratio of amount traded to volume
    │   ├── Calculate the average amount traded over 30 days
    │   └── Calculate the deviation of the current day's amount from this average
    ├── Volume-Weighted Momentum: Combine smoothed momentum with volume spike analysis
    ├── Volume ratio - Current Volume / SMA(Volume)
    ├── Price-volume momentum - (Close - Open) * Volume
    ├── Large trade indicator - If (Volume > 2 * SMA(Volume), 1, 0)
    └── Money flow - (Close - Open) * Amount
└── Thought 1.4: Advanced Intraday and Momentum Integration
    ├── Intraday Volatility: Standard Deviation of (High - Low) over the past 7 days
    ├── Momentum Oscillator: (Close - 14-day SMA(Close)) / 14-day SMA(Close)
    └── Intraday Momentum Score: (Intraday Volatility * Momentum Oscillator)
└── Final Alpha Factor:
    ├── Composite factor: (SMA ratio + EMA ratio + WMA ratio + Intraday volatility + Range over close + Volume ratio + Price-volume momentum + Large trade indicator + Money flow)
    ├── Incorporate Price Direction, Volume Spike, and Volume Change
    └── Incorporate Intraday Momentum Score
