- Sub-Thought: Explore trend strength.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Calculate the Price Momentum, defined by (Close_t - Close_{t-n}) / Close_{t-n}, where n can be 10 or 30 days, to measure trend direction and strength.
- Sub-Thought: Identify potential reversal points.
  - Sub-Sub-Thought: Create a Reversal Potential indicator, defined by (High_t - Close_t) + (Open_t - Low_t), to highlight days where a large part of the day's range is covered during the day but not at the close.
