- Perform alpha mining using historical price and volume data
  - Analyze daily return and intraday volatility
    - Daily return: (close_t - open_t) / open_t
    - Intraday volatility: (high_t - low_t) / open_t
    - Advanced daily return: (close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1
    - Advanced daily volatility: (high_t - low_t) / close_t-1
  - Utilize moving averages for trend identification
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Close prices over a certain period
      - SMA ratio: close_t / SMA(close)
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close prices for more recent data emphasis
      - EMA ratio: close_t / EMA(close)
    - Short-term trend: 5-day MA of close prices
    - Long-term trend: 20-day MA of close prices
    - Trend indicator: 5-day MA - 20-day MA
  - Examine trading volume and market liquidity
    - Volume ratio: current_volume / SMA(volume)
    - Daily volume change: (volume_t - volume_t-1) / volume_t-1
    - Price-volume momentum: (close_t - open_t) * volume_t
  - Evaluate high and low range
    - Daily price range: (high_t - low_t)
    - High-low spread: (high_t - low_t) / (open_t + close_t)
  - Construct composite factors
    - Composite factor 1: (SMA ratio + EMA ratio + intraday_volatility + volume_ratio + price_volume_momentum)
    - Composite factor 2: (daily_return + daily_volatility) * daily_volume_change
    - Composite factor 3: trend_indicator * (close_t * volume_t - close_t-1 * volume_t-1) / (close_t-1 * volume_t-1)
    - Composite factor 4: (daily_return / daily_volatility) * daily_volume_change
    - Composite factor 5: (daily_price_range / (high_t + low_t)) * (volume_t - volume_t-1)
  - Combine multiple indicators for enhanced signals
    - Integrated momentum: (composite_factor_2 + composite_factor_4) / 2
    - Combined trend and range: (composite_factor_3 + composite_factor_5) / 2
- Evaluate factor performance
  - Correlation with future returns
  - Backtest on historical data
  - Out-of-sample testing
