Thought: Develop a weighted moving average (WMA) based factor to predict future stock returns
    Thought: Calculate the 50-day WMA of closing prices
        Thought: Compute the 50-day weighted rolling average of the close price, giving more weight to recent prices
    Thought: Use the difference between the current day's close price and the 50-day WMA as an alpha factor
        Thought: Subtract the 50-day WMA from the current day's close price to create the raw alpha factor
Thought: Incorporate volume into the alpha factor to account for trading activity
    Thought: Calculate the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of volume
        Thought: Compute the 20-day EMA of the volume
    Thought: Create a volume-based alpha factor by comparing today's volume to its 20-day EMA
        Thought: Divide today's volume by the 20-day EMA of volume to create the volume factor
Thought: Combine the WMA and volume factors to create a composite alpha factor
    Thought: Multiply the raw alpha factor (close price - 50-day WMA) by the volume factor (volume / 20-day EMA)
        Thought: Generate the final composite alpha factor by multiplying the two sub-factors
Thought: Incorporate high and low prices to capture intraday volatility
    Thought: Calculate the 10-day Average True Range (ATR) using high, low, and close prices
        Thought: Compute the 10-day ATR to measure the average volatility
    Thought: Create a volatility-based alpha factor
        Thought: Divide the current day's range (high - low) by the 10-day ATR to create the volatility factor
Thought: Combine the WMA, volume, and volatility factors to create a comprehensive composite alpha factor
    Thought: Multiply the composite alpha factor (WMA factor * volume factor) by the volatility factor
        Thought: Generate the final comprehensive composite alpha factor by multiplying the three sub-factors
