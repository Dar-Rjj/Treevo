Thought: Develop a simple moving average (SMA) based factor to predict future stock returns
    Thought: Calculate the 50-day SMA of closing prices
        Thought: Compute the 50-day rolling average of the close price
    Thought: Use the difference between the current day's close price and the 50-day SMA as an alpha factor
        Thought: Subtract the 50-day SMA from the current day's close price to create the raw alpha factor
Thought: Incorporate volume into the alpha factor to account for trading activity
    Thought: Calculate the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of volume
        Thought: Compute the 20-day EMA of the volume
    Thought: Create a volume-based alpha factor by comparing today's volume to its 20-day EMA
        Thought: Divide today's volume by the 20-day EMA of volume to create the volume factor
Thought: Combine the SMA and volume factors to create a composite alpha factor
    Thought: Multiply the raw alpha factor (close price - 50-day SMA) by the volume factor (volume / 20-day EMA)
        Thought: Generate the final composite alpha factor by multiplying the two sub-factors
