Thought: Calculate the Momentum Factor
- Sub-thought: Compute the 10-day moving average of close prices
- Sub-thought: Compute the 50-day moving average of close prices
- Sub-thought: Subtract the 50-day moving average from the 10-day moving average to get the momentum factor

Thought: Calculate the Money Flow Index (MFI)
- Sub-thought: Calculate typical price for each day (typical_price = (high + low + close) / 3)
- Sub-thought: Calculate raw money flow (raw_money_flow = typical_price * volume)
- Sub-thought: Determine positive and negative money flow
- Sub-thought: Sum positive money flow over the last 14 days
- Sub-thought: Sum negative money flow over the last 14 days
- Sub-thought: Compute the money flow ratio (money_flow_ratio = sum_positive_money_flow / sum_negative_money_flow)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the MFI (MFI = 100 - (100 / (1 + money_flow_ratio)))

Thought: Calculate the Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Sub-thought: Calculate daily price changes (price_change = close - previous_close)
- Sub-thought: Separate positive and negative price changes
- Sub-thought: Average positive gains over the last 14 days
- Sub-thought: Average absolute negative losses over the last 14 days
- Sub-thought: Compute the relative strength (RS = avg_gain / avg_loss)
- Sub-thought: Calculate the RSI (RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS)))

Thought: Calculate the On-Balance Volume (OBV)
- Sub-thought: Initialize OBV to 0
- Sub-thought: If today's close is greater than yesterday's close, add today's volume to OBV
- Sub-thought: If today's close is less than yesterday's close, subtract today's volume from OBV
- Sub-thought: If today's close is equal to yesterday's close, do nothing
- Sub-thought: The resulting value is the OBV for the current day
