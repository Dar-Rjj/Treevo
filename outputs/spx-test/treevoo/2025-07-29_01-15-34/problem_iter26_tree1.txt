Thought: Enhance the prediction of future stock returns by incorporating both price and volume trends
    Thought: Develop a simple moving average (SMA) based factor to predict future stock returns
        Thought: Calculate the 50-day SMA of closing prices
            Thought: Compute the 50-day rolling average of the close price
        Thought: Use the difference between the current day's close price and the 50-day SMA as an alpha factor
            Thought: Subtract the 50-day SMA from the current day's close price to create the raw alpha factor
    Thought: Incorporate volume into the alpha factor to account for trading activity
        Thought: Calculate the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of volume
            Thought: Compute the 20-day EMA of the volume
        Thought: Create a volume-based alpha factor by comparing today's volume to its 20-day EMA
            Thought: Divide today's volume by the 20-day EMA of volume to create the volume factor
    Thought: Combine the SMA and volume factors to create a composite alpha factor
        Thought: Multiply the raw alpha factor (close price - 50-day SMA) by the volume factor (volume / 20-day EMA)
            Thought: Generate the final composite alpha factor by multiplying the two sub-factors
    Thought: Introduce a trend-following component using high and low prices
        Thought: Calculate the 30-day EMA of high prices
            Thought: Compute the 30-day EMA of the high price
        Thought: Calculate the 30-day EMA of low prices
            Thought: Compute the 30-day EMA of the low price
        Thought: Create a trend-following alpha factor using the difference between the 30-day EMA of high and low prices
            Thought: Subtract the 30-day EMA of low prices from the 30-day EMA of high prices to create the trend-following alpha factor
    Thought: Combine the composite alpha factor with the trend-following alpha factor
        Thought: Add the composite alpha factor and the trend-following alpha factor
            Thought: Generate the enhanced composite alpha factor by adding the two sub-factors
