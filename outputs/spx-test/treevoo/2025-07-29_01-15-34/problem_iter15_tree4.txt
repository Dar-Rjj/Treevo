Factor Development for Predicting Future Stock Returns
- Technical Indicators
  - Momentum and Trend Following
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover
      - SMA(20) - SMA(50)
    - Rate of Change (ROC)
      - ROC(14) = (Close_t / Close_(t-14)) - 1
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover
      - EMA(10) - EMA(30)
  - Volatility
    - True Range (TR)
      - TR = Max[(High_t - Low_t), Abs(High_t - Close_(t-1)), Abs(Low_t - Close_(t-1))]
    - Average True Range (ATR)
      - ATR(20) = 20-day moving average of TR
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - RSI(14) = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
      - RS = Average Gain / Average Loss over the last 14 days
- Price Patterns
  - Candlestick Patterns
    - Bullish Engulfing
      - Open_t > Close_(t-1) AND Close_t < Open_(t-1)
    - Bearish Engulfing
      - Open_t < Close_(t-1) AND Close_t > Open_(t-1)
  - Breakout Patterns
    - Resistance Level Break
      - High_t > Max(High_last_30_days)
    - Support Level Break
      - Low_t < Min(Low_last_30_days)
- Volume Analysis
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    - OBV_t = OBV_(t-1) + (Close_t - Close_(t-1)) * Volume_t
  - Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    - VWAP_t = (Sum(Close_t * Volume_t) / Sum(Volume_t)) from t-9 to t
- Liquidity
  - Bid-Ask Spread
    - Bid-Ask_Spread_t = |Ask_Price_t - Bid_Price_t|
  - Market Depth
    - Total_Volume_at_Best_Level
      - Sum(volume at best bid and ask levels)
- Market Sentiment
  - Price and Volume Trends
    - Price_to_Volume_Ratio
      - (Close_t / Open_t) / (Volume_t / Volume_(t-1))
- Fundamental Analysis
  - Earnings Surprise
    - %Surprise = (Actual_Earnings - Estimated_Earnings) / Estimated_Earnings
  - Dividend Yield
    - Dividend_Yield = Annual_Dividend_Per_Share / Current_Price
