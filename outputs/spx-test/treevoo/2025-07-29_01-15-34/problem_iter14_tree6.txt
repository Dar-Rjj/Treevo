Thought: Enhanced Alpha Mining with Integrated Price and Volume Indicators

- Sub-Thought: Intraday Reversal and Momentum with Trend-Based Adjustments
  -- Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday High-Low Range
  |   ├── Use High price
  |   └── Use Low price
  |       └── Subtract Low from High
  -- Sub-Thought: Calculate Closing Position in Intraday Range
  |   ├── Subtract Open price from Close price
  |   └── Divide by Intraday High-Low Range
  -- Sub-Thought: Calculate Intraday Volume Intensity
  |   ├── Use Volume
  |   └── Divide by the sum of past 10-day volumes
  -- Sub-Thought: Calculate Daily Return
  |   ├── Use Close prices
  |   └── Compute (close(t) - close(t-1)) / close(t-1)
  -- Sub-Thought: Identify Local Peaks and Troughs
  |   ├── Find rolling maximum of close prices over a certain window
  |   └── Find rolling minimum of close prices over a certain window
  --- Sub-Thought: Measure From High Point
  |   ├── Compute difference between current close and its nearest peak in the past
  --- Sub-Thought: Measure From Low Point
  |   ├── Compute difference between current close and its nearest trough in the past
  -- Sub-Thought: Average Trading Volume
  |   ├── Compute average trading volume over a specific lookback period
  -- Sub-Thought: Volume Anomaly Factor
  |   ├── Define as the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume
  -- Sub-Thought: Money Flow Analysis
  |   ├── Positive money flow: Sum of (volume * daily_return) when daily_return > 0 over a lookback period
  |   ├── Negative money flow: Sum of (volume * daily_return) when daily_return < 0 over a lookback period
  |   └── Ratio of positive to negative money flow as an indicator of market sentiment
  -- Sub-Thought: Combine Factors
  |   ├── Multiply Intraday Volume Intensity with Closing Position
  |   ├── Adjust for Recent Price Trend
  |   |   ├── Use Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Close prices over past 20 days
  |   |   └── Subtract EMA from current Close price
  |   └── Combine with Daily Return, Peak and Trough Measures, and Volume Anomaly
  |       ├── Add Daily Return
  |       ├── Add Measure From High Point
  |       ├── Add Measure From Low Point
  |       └── Add Volume Anomaly Factor
  -- Sub-Thought: Compound Factor
  |   ├── Factor combining momentum and volume anomaly: Daily return multiplied by (current_volume/avg_volume)
  |   ├── Factor indicating value change with respect to peaks and valleys, adjusted by recent volume trends
  |   |   ├── Take (close - min_close_window) / (max_close_window - min_close_window) * (current_volume/avg_volume)
