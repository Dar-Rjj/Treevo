    - Compute the ratio of current day's volume to the moving average of the last 20 days' volumes, indicating potential market interest
  - Analyze intra-day price action for patterns
    - Determine the range of the day (high[t] - low[t]), and compare it with the previous day's range; an increasing trend may indicate growing market volatility or interest

  - Look into the significance of the closing price relative to the day's high and low
    - Compute where the closing price falls within the day's range: (close[t] - low[t]) / (high[t] - low[t]), which can indicate if the stock closed near its high (bullish) or low (bearish)
  - Investigate the role of the amount traded in predicting future prices
