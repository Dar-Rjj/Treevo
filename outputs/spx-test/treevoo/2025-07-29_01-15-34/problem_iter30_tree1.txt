Thought: Develop a composite alpha factor using exponential moving average (EMA) and volume trends to predict future stock returns
    Thought: Calculate the 21-day EMA of closing prices
        Thought: Compute the 21-day EMA of the close price
    Thought: Use the difference between the current day's close price and the 21-day EMA as an alpha factor
        Thought: Subtract the 21-day EMA from the current day's close price
    Thought: Incorporate volume into the alpha factor
        Thought: Calculate the 14-day EMA of volume
            Thought: Compute the 14-day EMA of the volume
        Thought: Create a volume-based alpha factor
            Thought: Subtract today's volume from the 14-day EMA of volume
    Thought: Combine the EMA and volume factors
        Thought: Multiply the raw alpha factor (close price - 21-day EMA) by the volume factor (today's volume - 14-day EMA)
