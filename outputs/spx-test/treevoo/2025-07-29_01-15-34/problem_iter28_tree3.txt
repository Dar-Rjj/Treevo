Thought: Develop a simple moving average (SMA) and volume-based composite alpha factor to predict future stock returns
    Thought: Calculate the 50-day SMA of closing prices
        Thought: Compute the 50-day rolling average of the close price
    Thought: Use the difference between the current day's close price and the 50-day SMA as an alpha factor
        Thought: Subtract the 50-day SMA from the current day's close price
    Thought: Incorporate volume into the alpha factor
        Thought: Calculate the 20-day EMA of volume
            Thought: Compute the 20-day EMA of the volume
        Thought: Create a volume-based alpha factor
            Thought: Divide today's volume by the 20-day EMA of volume
    Thought: Combine the SMA and volume factors
        Thought: Multiply the raw alpha factor (close price - 50-day SMA) by the volume factor (volume / 20-day EMA)
