Thought: Explore Moving Averages to Capture Trend
  Thought: Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    Thought: Compute SMA for closing prices over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 days)
      Thought: Use the SMA values as a factor
  Thought: Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    Thought: Compute EMA for closing prices over different periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 days)
      Thought: Use the EMA values as a factor
  Thought: Compare SMA and EMA
    Thought: Calculate the difference between SMA and EMA
      Thought: Use the difference as a factor

Thought: Analyze Price Movement with Candlestick Patterns
  Thought: Identify Bullish and Bearish Engulfing Patterns
    Thought: Check if the previous day's high is less than the current day's high and the previous day's low is greater than the current day's low
      Thought: Use the occurrence of the pattern as a factor
  Thought: Identify Hammer and Hanging Man Patterns
    Thought: Check if the body size is less than a certain percentage of the total range
      Thought: Use the occurrence of the pattern as a factor

Thought: Evaluate Volume and Price Relationship
  Thought: Calculate On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    Thought: Increment OBV if the closing price is higher than the previous day, decrement if lower
      Thought: Use OBV as a factor
  Thought: Calculate Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    Thought: Multiply each day's close by its volume, sum these, and divide by the total volume
      Thought: Use VWAP as a factor
  Thought: Analyze Volume Trends
    Thought: Calculate the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume over a period (e.g., 20 days)
      Thought: Use the ratio as a factor

Thought: Consider High and Low Prices
  Thought: Calculate True Range
    Thought: Compute the maximum of the current day's high minus the current day's low, the absolute value of the current day's high minus the previous day's close, and the absolute value of the current day's low minus the previous day's close
      Thought: Use the true range as a factor
  Thought: Calculate Average True Range (ATR)
    Thought: Compute the average of the true range over a period (e.g., 14 days)
      Thought: Use ATR as a factor
  Thought: Calculate the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO)
    Thought: Compute the difference between the 26-day EMA and the 12-day EMA, then divide by the 26-day EMA
      Thought: Use the PPO as a factor
