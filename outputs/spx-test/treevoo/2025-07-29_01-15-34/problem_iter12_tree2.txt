Thought: Develop alpha factors based on historical price patterns and volume for predictive stock returns

- Sub-Thought: Utilize open, high, low, close prices to construct trend-based indicators
  -- Sub-Thought: Calculate daily return based on closing prices as (close(t) - close(t-1)) / close(t-1)
  -- Sub-Thought: Identify the rolling maximum of close prices over a certain window to determine local peaks
  -- Sub-Thought: Identify the rolling minimum of close prices over a certain window to determine local troughs
  --- Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between current close and its nearest peak in the past to measure from high point
  --- Sub-Thought: Compute the difference between current close and its nearest trough in the past to measure from low point

- Sub-Thought: Use volume and amount to assess market activity and sentiment
  -- Sub-Thought: Compute the average trading volume over a specific lookback period
  -- Sub-Thought: Define a factor as the ratio of current day's volume to the average volume to capture unusual trading activities
  -- Sub-Thought: Calculate a cumulative sum of positive or negative daily returns weighted by volume to gauge money flow
  --- Sub-Thought: Positive money flow: Sum of (volume * daily_return) when daily_return > 0 over a lookback period
  --- Sub-Thought: Negative money flow: Sum of (volume * daily_return) when daily_return < 0 over a lookback period
  ---- Sub-Thought: Ratio of positive to negative money flow as an indicator of market sentiment

- Sub-Thought: Combine price and volume indicators to form compound factors
  -- Sub-Thought: Factor combining momentum and volume anomaly: Daily return multiplied by (current_volume/avg_volume)
  -- Sub-Thought: Factor indicating value change with respect to peaks and valleys, adjusted by recent volume trends
  --- Sub-Thought: For example, take (close - min_close_window) / (max_close_window - min_close_window) * (current_volume/avg_volume)
  ---- Sub-Thought: This captures both price movement relative to recent extremes and the support from trading volume
