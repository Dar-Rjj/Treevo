Incorporate long-term trends, use exponential smoothing, and combine factors for robustness.
Incorporate more robust volatility measures, use adaptive weights, and add interaction terms for richer signals.
Incorporate RSI for momentum, reduce interaction terms, and use multiplicative combinations for simplicity and effectiveness.
Integrate volatility, liquidity, and trend with more sophisticated interactions and normalization.
Normalize with standard deviation, simplify interaction terms, and use ATR for robust volatility.
Incorporate volatility, liquidity, and trend; use EMA for smoothing; combine factors additively or multiplicatively.
Incorporate more dynamic measures, use exponential smoothing, and balance trend and volatility components.
Incorporate short-term trends, volume, and volatility; use multiplicative combination for non-linear interaction.
Incorporate more diverse financial indicators, use adaptive weights, and consider seasonal adjustments for improved heuristics.
Incorporate adaptive EMA, enhance interaction terms, and consider volatility normalization for improved alpha factor robustness.
