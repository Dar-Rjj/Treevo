```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between closing price and the average of open and close, then scale by volume
    price_diff = (df['close'] - (df['open'] + df['close']) / 2)
    scaled_price_diff = price_diff * df['volume']
    return scaled_price_diff
```
