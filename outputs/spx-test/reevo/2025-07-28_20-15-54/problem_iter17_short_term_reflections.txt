Incorporate adaptive weighting, RSI, and ATR for robustness; use interaction terms for comprehensive signals.
Incorporate adaptive weighting, relative strength, and true range for enhanced factor robustness and predictive power.
Simplify calculations, use direct ratios, and combine factors additively for clearer, more interpretable alpha signals.
Use EMA for smoother signals, incorporate MFI for volume-weighted momentum, and adaptively weight interaction terms.
Incorporate more diverse factors, use weighted combinations, and consider factor decay for better adaptability.
Simplify calculations, use rolling means, and combine factors additively for clarity and performance.
Incorporate more dynamic volatility measures and interaction terms for richer signals.
Simplify calculations, use rolling means, focus on key interactions, and avoid over-normalization for better interpretability and performance.
Use adaptive weighting, smooth with EMA, and consider fewer, more meaningful interaction terms.
Incorporate EMA for smoothing, use MFI for volume-weighted momentum, and adaptively weight factors by their past performance.
