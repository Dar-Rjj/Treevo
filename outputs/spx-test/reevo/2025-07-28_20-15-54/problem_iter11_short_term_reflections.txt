Incorporate dynamic weights, use exponential smoothing, and leverage adaptive EMA for more responsive and robust alpha factors.
Incorporate diverse indicators, normalize factors, and use multiplicative interaction terms for richer signals.
Simplify, normalize, and combine factors. Use meaningful interactions. Avoid overcomplicating with too many multiplicative terms.
Integrate advanced technical indicators and adaptively weight interaction terms.
Simplify interactions, normalize factors, and use EWM for smoothing. Consider feature importance and avoid overfitting.
Incorporate adaptive EMA, multi-period momentum, and volume-scaled inefficiencies for enhanced factor stability and predictive power.
Focus on simplicity, combine fewer, more meaningful metrics, and normalize by volatility for robustness.
Simplify calculations, use rolling means, integrate fewer but more meaningful interaction terms.
Simplify calculations, use direct price/volume changes, and focus on robust, interpretable interaction terms.
Simplify calculations, use rolling means, normalize factors, and integrate interaction terms for robustness.
