Focus on meaningful price differences, volume scaling, and avoid unnecessary complexity for clearer signals.
Incorporate volatility, use relative changes, and consider multi-period trends for more robust factors.
Incorporate volatility and momentum; use more comprehensive price/volume features; normalize by relevant, dynamic metrics.
Incorporate momentum, use robust volatility measures like ATR, and consider volume for liquidity impact.
Incorporate momentum, volume changes, and use normalization for stability and interpretability in your heuristics.
Incorporate price momentum, volatility, and volume-weighted changes for more robust and dynamic alpha factors.
Incorporate more historical data, use volatility, and consider market trends for robust alpha factor generation.
Integrate momentum, trend strength, and volume changes; consider relative positions and smooth indicators.
Incorporate trends, volatility, and normalize factors. Use rolling statistics for smoothing and add interaction terms.
Incorporate more diverse features, normalize by relevant metrics, and consider interaction effects between factors.
