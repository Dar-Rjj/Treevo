```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close, then divide by the average of last 5 days' high prices
    momentum_factor = (df['close'] - df['close'].shift(1)) / (df['high'].rolling(window=5).mean() + 1e-7)
    
    # Calculate a volume change factor comparing today's volume to the average of last 5 days' volume
    volume_change = (df['volume'] - df['volume'].rolling(window=5).mean()) / (df['volume'].rolling(window=5).std() + 1e-7)
    
    # Combine the two factors in a heuristic way
    alpha_factor = momentum_factor * volume_change
