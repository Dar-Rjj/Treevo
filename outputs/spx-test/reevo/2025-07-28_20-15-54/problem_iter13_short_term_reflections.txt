Use adaptive weighting, EMA for smoothing, and incorporate MFI for volume-weighted momentum.
Optimize EMA spans, use rolling stats for normalization, and simplify interaction terms for more robust and interpretable factors.
Multiply interaction terms for combined effect; consider additional factors like MACD, OBV, and sector-specific indicators.
Simplify calculations, use rolling means for normalization, and integrate more interaction terms for comprehensive signals.
Simplify calculations, use rolling means and standard deviations, and avoid over-complicating with adaptive weights.
Normalize factors, use EMA for smoother trends, and consider volatility measures for robustness.
Incorporate adaptive EMA, relative strength, and multi-period momentum for robust, dynamic factor generation.
Simplify calculations, use rolling means for normalization, and ensure factors are intuitive and less correlated.
Normalize with relevant metrics, use moving averages, and integrate interaction terms for comprehensive signals.
Integrate liquidity, trend, and volatility; use exponential weighting for more reactive and adaptive factors.
