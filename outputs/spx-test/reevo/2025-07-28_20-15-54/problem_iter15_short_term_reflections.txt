Simplify calculations, focus on core price and volume changes, and use additive rather than multiplicative interactions.
Simplify calculations, use direct ratios, and add more interaction terms for capturing complex relationships.
Incorporate multi-period trends, use exponential smoothing, and combine with volume for liquidity adjustments.
Normalize factors, use EMA for smoothing, and adaptively weight interaction terms by past performance.
Consider shorter EMA spans, adaptive weighting, and incorporating additional momentum indicators like MFI.
Simplify calculations, use rolling means for normalization, and average interaction terms for stability.
Incorporate adaptive EMA, multi-period momentum, and volatility scaling for enhanced factor robustness.
Use shorter EMA spans, normalize factors, and adaptively weight interaction terms based on past performance.
Incorporate more dynamic weighting, use EMA for normalization, and add volume-weighted factors.
Simplify calculations, use rolling means, and combine factors linearly for clarity and effectiveness.
