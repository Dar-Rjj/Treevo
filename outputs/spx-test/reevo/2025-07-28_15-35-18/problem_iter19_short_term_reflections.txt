Shorten EMAs, integrate trend strength, and add interaction terms for enhanced responsiveness and factor performance.
Reduce EMA span for quicker response, simplify interactions, balance factors, and consider sector-specific volatility.
Shorter EMA windows, combine factors thoughtfully, and consider normalization for better performance.
Incorporate longer-term EMAs, balance short and long terms, and simplify interactions for more robust and interpretable factors.
Use longer EMA periods, incorporate sophisticated volatility, and leverage interaction terms for predictive power.
Shorten EMA windows, integrate external and macroeconomic indicators, and avoid over-normalization for more responsive and informed factors.
Consider longer smoothing periods, include return trends, and use more sophisticated volatility measures for robustness.
Shorter EMA windows, combined short and long-term volatility, and interactive volume measures enhance responsiveness and stability.
Use shorter EMA spans, combine short and long-term factors, and include interaction terms for richer signals.
Use longer-term EMAs, incorporate sophisticated volatility, and add inter-period relationships for enhanced factor robustness.
