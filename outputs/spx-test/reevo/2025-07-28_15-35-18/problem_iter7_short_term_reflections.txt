Integrate more market microstructure, use adaptive windows, and consider cross-asset factors for robustness.
Use EMA for smoother trends, combine factors multiplicatively, and consider excluding or refining volatility and market depth.
Incorporate more sophisticated volatility and liquidity measures, and consider additional market microstructure features.
Integrate momentum, liquidity, and trend strength; use EMA for smoother, more responsive signals.
Incorporate more sophisticated volatility measures, use adaptive windows, and integrate macroeconomic indicators for better heuristics.
Incorporate relative strength, liquidity, and market depth; use EMA for smoother signals; balance with momentum and spread.
Incorporate more robust volatility measures, adaptive smoothing, and feature interaction for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate long-term trends, volume spikes, and normalize factors for better stability and predictive power.
Consider trend, liquidity, and volatility interactions; use exponential smoothing for more weight on recent data.
Integrate relative strength and weakness, use simpler momentum, and avoid overly complex combinations.
