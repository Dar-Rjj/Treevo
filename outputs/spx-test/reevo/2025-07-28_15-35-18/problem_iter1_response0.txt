```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between close and open prices normalized by the true range (high - low)
    true_range = df['high'] - df['low']
    price_diff = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Create a factor based on the normalized price movement
    price_movement_factor = price_diff / (true_range + 1e-7)
    
    # Volume-weighted moving average of the price movement factor
    volume_weighted_factor = (price_movement_factor * df['volume']).rolling(window=5).mean() / df['volume'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    
    return volume_weighted_factor
