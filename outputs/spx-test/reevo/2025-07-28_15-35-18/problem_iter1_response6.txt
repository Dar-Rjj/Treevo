```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between high and low
    range_diff = (df['high'] - df['low'])
    
    # Calculate the weighted average of close and open prices using volume as weights
    weighted_avg = (df['close'] * df['volume'] + df['open'] * df['volume']) / (2 * df['volume'])
    
    # Calculate a factor that represents the normalized distance of the weighted average from the low to the range
    factor = (weighted_avg - df['low']) / (range_diff + 1e-7)
    
    return factor
