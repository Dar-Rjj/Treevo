Incorporate more dynamic and responsive indicators, and use normalized factors for balanced impact.
Incorporate more sophisticated volatility measures, refine momentum, and consider inter-period relationships.
Simplify, use shorter EMA spans, and focus on key indicators for more responsive and interpretable factors.
Shorten EMA spans, use absolute returns for volatility, balance momentum and liquidity, and normalize by volatility.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, avoid over-smoothing, and consider more robust volatility measures.
Incorporate longer smoothing, diverse indicators, and exponential smoothing for more robust and stable factors.
Consider incorporating mean reversion, more refined volatility measures, and interaction terms between factors.
Incorporate more dynamic trend and volume measures, use normalized ratios, and smooth signals for stability.
Incorporate mean reversion, use adaptive weights, and integrate macroeconomic indicators for enhanced factor robustness.
Adjust EMA spans for responsiveness, balance factors, and normalize with volatility for improved predictive power.
