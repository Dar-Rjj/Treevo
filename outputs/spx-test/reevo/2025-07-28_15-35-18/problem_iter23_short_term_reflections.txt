Incorporate diverse timeframes, combine short and long EMAs, and include inter-period relationships for robustness.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, avoid over-complexity, and ensure factors are uncorrelated.
Incorporate trend consistency, sentiment, and refined volume interaction for enhanced predictive power.
Shorter EMA windows and fewer volatility factors improve responsiveness and reduce noise.
Shorten time windows, combine short- and long-term EMAs, include more volatility factors.
Extend time horizons, include more volatility terms, and refine trend measures for better heuristics.
Incorporate more sophisticated trend and volatility measures, and refine interaction terms for clearer signal.
Incorporate multiple time horizons, use interaction terms, and balance responsiveness with stability.
Incorporate more price and volume derivatives, use EMA for smoothing, and integrate market depth and trend consistency.
Shorten EMA spans, use macro and sentiment indicators, and incorporate robust volatility measures for improved factor performance.
