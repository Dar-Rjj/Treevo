Integrate more market dynamics, use exponential smoothing, and combine factors with weighted averages.
Consider incorporating more market dynamics, like order flow imbalance, and use advanced smoothing techniques.
Incorporate volatility, mean reversion, and volume trends; combine signals thoughtfully for clearer market insights.
Incorporate relative strength, liquidity, and volatility with dynamic momentum for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate volatility, liquidity, and price patterns; use multiplicative combinations for non-linear relationships.
Incorporate relative strength, trend persistence, and market depth for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate trend, liquidity, and strength; use exponential smoothing for responsiveness; combine factors multiplicatively for non-linearity.
Incorporate market depth, use more robust volatility measures, and consider additional trend and momentum indicators.
Incorporate more dynamic measures, use EMA for responsiveness, and include bid-ask spread for liquidity insights.
Incorporate more dynamic price and volume measures, use shorter time frames, and normalize factors.
