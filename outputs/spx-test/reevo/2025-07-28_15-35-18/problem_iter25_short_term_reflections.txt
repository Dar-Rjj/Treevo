Consider feature weighting, trend consistency, and sentiment for more robust and interpretable factors.
Integrate more interaction terms and adjust EMA spans for enhanced sensitivity and factor diversification.
Incorporate trend consistency, sentiment, and short/long-term EMA interactions for more robust factor values.
Consider multiplicative interactions and dynamic weighting for non-linear relationships and enhanced sensitivity.
Incorporate more dynamic trend and sentiment analysis, reduce redundancy, and normalize factors for better comparability.
Incorporate longer timeframes, multiple volatility measures, and multiplicative interactions for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Use weighted sums, incorporate sentiment, and measure trend consistency for improved factor performance.
Incorporate more diverse factors, use multiplicative combinations, and include a mean reversion component.
Equal weighting, simpler calculations, and fewer interactions can improve factor clarity and performance.
Shorten time windows, incorporate more price ratios, and balance short-term and long-term factors.
