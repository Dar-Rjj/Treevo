Smooth components for stability, incorporate volatility, and test different windows and weighting.
Incorporate more dynamic measures, utilize adaptive windows, and consider both strength and weakness for a balanced factor.
Incorporate more dynamic and adaptive measures, consider cross-asset correlations, and utilize machine learning for factor synthesis.
Incorporate more dynamic volatility measures, sentiment analysis, and macroeconomic indicators for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate relative strength, adaptive volatility, and liquidity measures; simplify combinations for clarity.
Incorporate diverse market signals, use both SMA and EMA, and normalize by volatility for stability.
Incorporate more diverse signals, normalize factors, and consider market microstructure for enhanced predictive power.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, avoid over-smoothing, and combine factors meaningfully.
Consider volatility, liquidity, and market depth; use exponential smoothing for more responsive signals.
Use shorter lookback periods, incorporate both strength and weakness, and simplify factor combinations for better performance.
