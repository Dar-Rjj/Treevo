Increase EMA span for smoother signals; add trend in price range for dynamic volatility insight.
Use shorter-term EMAs, incorporate external and macroeconomic indicators, and simplify factor interactions for better performance.
Increase window sizes, use multiplicative combination, and integrate external indicators for improved factor robustness.
Reduce complexity, focus on key indicators, and avoid overfitting to enhance factor performance and interpretability.
Reduce window sizes for more responsiveness; simplify interactions; balance momentum, liquidity, and volatility.
Increase window sizes for smoother signals; incorporate RSI for momentum; normalize factors for better comparability.
Increase window sizes, use EWM for smoothing, and create interaction terms for richer factor representation.
Shorter EMA windows and integrating trend strength can enhance factor responsiveness and predictive power.
Shorten EMA spans, incorporate short and long-term volatilities, and use volume interaction for enhanced responsiveness.
Incorporate multiple timeframes, use both SMA and EMA, and combine with volatility measures for enhanced factor robustness.
