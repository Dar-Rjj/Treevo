Consider shorter EMA spans, adaptive windows, and balance between momentum, liquidity, and volatility.
Incorporate diverse, smoothed indicators; balance momentum, volatility, and liquidity; normalize for comparability.
Incorporate advanced volatility, range, and inter-period dynamics for improved factor robustness.
Shorter periods, EMA for responsiveness, and balanced factor combination improve performance. Consider incorporating trend strength and market sentiment.
Increase EMA span for smoother trends, add inter-period ratios, and refine volatility with EWM standard deviation.
Incorporate shorter EMAs, market depth, and bid-ask spread for more responsive and informative factors.
Shorten EMA spans, integrate more recent data, and reconsider volatility factor's multiplicative role.
Increase EMA span for smoother signals, incorporate more robust volatility measures, and balance factors with market conditions.
Incorporate adaptive windows, market depth, and normalized volatility for enhanced factor responsiveness and robustness.
Reduce window sizes for responsiveness; use absolute returns for volatility; balance components with a mean reversion signal.
