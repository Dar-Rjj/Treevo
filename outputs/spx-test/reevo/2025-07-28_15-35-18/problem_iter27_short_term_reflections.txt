Incorporate interaction terms, use multiplicative combination, and include money flow for enhanced predictive power.
Shorten EMA spans, use multi-period momentum, incorporate macro indicators, and focus on short to medium-term volatility.
Incorporate more dynamic and sentiment factors, use longer EMA spans, and apply adaptive weighting schemes.
Shorten lookback periods, add mean reversion, and incorporate money flow for dynamic, responsive factors.
Incorporate more interaction terms and weight factors by their predictive power.
Incorporate more EMAs, refine interaction terms, and consider external sentiment data for improved alpha factor performance.
Integrate sector-specific indicators, leverage machine learning, and optimize weights via backtesting.
Incorporate dynamic weighting, trend consistency, and sentiment for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate more trend and sentiment factors, and consider using machine learning for dynamic factor weighting.
Use shorter-term EMAs, include more volatility factors, and incorporate a macro indicator for improved responsiveness and stability.
