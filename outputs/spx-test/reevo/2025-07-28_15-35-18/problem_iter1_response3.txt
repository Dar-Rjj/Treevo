```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between today's and yesterday's closing price
    df['price_diff'] = df['close'].diff()
    # Volume weighted price change
    df['vwap_change'] = (df['price_diff'] * df['volume']).rolling(window=5).mean()
    # Average volume over a 5 day window
    df['avg_volume_5d'] = df['volume'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    # Alpha factor: Volume weighted price change divided by average volume
    alpha_factor = df['vwap_change'] / df['avg_volume_5d']
    return alpha_factor
