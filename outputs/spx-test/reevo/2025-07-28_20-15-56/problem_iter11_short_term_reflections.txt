Incorporate mean reversion, seasonality, and external macroeconomic indicators for more robust alpha factor generation.
Incorporate seasonality, macroeconomic indicators, and sentiment analysis; refine weightage of existing factors.
Longer-term indicators, stable volatility, and balanced factors can enhance alpha factor robustness and interpretability.
Increase window sizes for smoother signals; remove less impactful factors; consider sector-specific or macroeconomic variables.
Incorporate more dynamic and market-responsive indicators, reduce redundancy, and focus on liquidity and sentiment measures.
Incorporate sector performance, use adaptive windows, and integrate macroeconomic indicators for improved alpha factor robustness.
Shorter periods, responsive volatility, and volume-weighted factors enhance predictive power.
Incorporate dual EMA, MFI, and dynamic weighting for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Simplify factors, focus on key indicators, and avoid overcomplicating with too many adjustments.
Simplify factor, remove redundant components, and focus on key drivers: momentum, volatility, and volume.
