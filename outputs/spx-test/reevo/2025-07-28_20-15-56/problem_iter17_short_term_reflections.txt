Consider shorter mean reversion periods and incorporate price-earnings ratio for valuation insight.
Shorten rolling windows, use EMA for smoothing, and focus on significant factors for clearer signals.
Simplify, focus on key drivers, avoid overcomplication, and ensure factors are interpretable and not correlated.
Focus on key, interpretable drivers; simplify calculations; use longer-term indicators for reversion.
Simplify factors, focus on key drivers, use long-term mean reversion, and avoid overcomplication.
Incorporate longer-term indicators, use VWAP, and consider multi-period mean reversion for stability.
Focus on key, interpretable drivers; remove less effective factors like RSI; simplify and avoid overfitting.
Incorporate diverse time frames, use multiple smoothing techniques, and combine short-term and long-term factors.
Consider shorter volatility windows, incorporate price patterns, and refine mean reversion for quicker market adaptation.
Reduce complexity, focus on key drivers, and use more relevant time frames for smoother and more interpretable factors.
