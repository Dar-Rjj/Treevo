Simplify, focus on key indicators, and balance short-term and long-term factors for clarity and effectiveness.
Shorter periods, EMA for volatility, and simpler mean reversion signals improve alpha factor performance.
Consider incorporating sector-specific factors, using machine learning for factor selection, and testing with different window sizes.
Consider shorter timeframes, integrate RSI, and use EMA for smoothing; focus on momentum, volatility, and sentiment.
Incorporate shorter momentum, refined volatility, and additional trend measures like RSI for enhanced predictive power.
Consider incorporating sector-specific trends and economic indicators for enhanced predictive power.
Shorter momentum, EMA for volatility, and closer mean reversion signals improve factor responsiveness.
Incorporate more technical indicators, like RSI, and use adaptive windows for dynamic factor adjustments.
Simplify factor combinations, focus on key indicators, and avoid overfitting to improve robustness and interpretability.
Adjust window sizes, incorporate additional financial metrics, and consider macroeconomic indicators for enhanced alpha factor robustness.
