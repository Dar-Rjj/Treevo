```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the closing and opening price
    close_open_diff = df['close'] - df['open']
    
    # Calculate the average of high and low prices
    avg_high_low = (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2
    
    # Calculate the percentage change in volume compared to the previous day
    volume_change = df['volume'].pct_change().fillna(0)
    
    # Combine the factors to create the alpha factor
    alpha_factor = (close_open_diff / avg_high_low) * volume_change
    
    return alpha_factor
