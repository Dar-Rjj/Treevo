Simplify, integrate adaptive windows, and focus on key, uncorrelated factors for robustness.
Shorter momentum and volatility windows, and combining short- and long-term mean reversion can enhance factor responsiveness.
Use shorter periods for momentum, EMA for smoother trends, and focus on more responsive volume and volatility measures.
Consider shorter lookback periods and use EMA for smoother, more responsive factors.
Incorporate adaptive windows, VWAP, and average trading volume for dynamic and comprehensive factor adjustments.
Adjust periods for momentum, use adaptive smoothing, and incorporate liquidity measures for enhanced alpha factor.
Opt for EMA over SMA, use consistent windows, and incorporate more liquidity and sentiment measures.
Incorporate adaptive parameters, additional indicators like MFI, and consider volume patterns for more robust alpha factors.
Use longer periods for stability, integrate VWAP, and balance factors to avoid overfitting.
Incorporate adaptive windows, additional financial metrics, and combine multiple RSI periods for improved factor robustness.
