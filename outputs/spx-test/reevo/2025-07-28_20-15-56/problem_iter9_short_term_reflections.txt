Integrate more diverse factors, use adaptive windows, and apply machine learning for non-linear relationships.
Incorporate adaptive metrics, liquidity, and dynamic weighting for more robust alpha factor generation.
Incorporate longer-term trends, use single EMA for volume, and balance factors to avoid overfitting.
Adjust window sizes, smoothing techniques, and integrate additional factors like trading volume patterns or external economic indicators.
Simplify calculations, focus on core indicators, and reduce overfitting to improve robustness and interpretability.
Adjust window sizes, incorporate macroeconomic indicators, and consider sector-specific factors for enhanced performance.
Incorporate multiple time frames, use weighted averages, and add more volume-based indicators.
Shorter momentum, focused volatility, streamlined RSI, and simplified factor combination enhance performance.
Simplify factors, focus on core indicators, and avoid overcomplication for better generalization.
Shorten time windows, integrate volume more deeply, and explore additional technical indicators for richer signals.
