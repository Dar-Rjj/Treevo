Shorter momentum, volatility windows; incorporate long-term trends; simplify and focus on key factors.
Simplify factors, focus on key indicators, and avoid overcomplicating with too many adjustments.
Simplify and focus on key indicators; less complexity can improve performance and interpretability.
Simplify and focus on key indicators. Combine momentum, volatility, and volume for a robust alpha factor.
Simplify, focus on shorter periods, and fewer interacting factors for clearer, more robust signals.
Integrate multi-period EMAs, adaptive weighting, and robust normalization for improved factor stability and predictive power.
Integrate more diverse factors, normalize data, and apply advanced statistical or machine learning techniques.
Shorter momentum, volatility periods, and incorporating VWAP, mean reversion enhance factor predictiveness.
Optimize window sizes, reduce redundancy, and focus on key, interpretable drivers.
Consider longer-term indicators, incorporate volume-weighted prices, and use mean reversion for enhanced predictive power.
