Incorporate more robust statistical measures, leverage EMAs, and consider multiple timeframes for a balanced approach.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and technical indicators. Use weighted averages and normalize features for better signal clarity.
Incorporate more sophisticated volatility measures and use smoothed, multi-period indicators for robustness.
Adjust window sizes, integrate sentiment, and combine diverse factors for robust alpha generation.
Incorporate more sophisticated indicators, smoother transformations, and dynamic weighting for better predictive power.
Integrate advanced statistical measures, utilize longer-term trends, and incorporate market sentiment for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate sector-specific trends, use adaptive windows, and integrate macroeconomic indicators for enhanced alpha factor robustness.
Incorporate multi-period analysis, use exponential smoothing, and integrate sentiment indicators for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate more diverse momentum periods, use log returns for volatility, and weight VPT averages differently.
Optimize window sizes, incorporate high/low ratios, and consider additional technical indicators for enhanced factor robustness.
