Increase window sizes for stability, use adaptive smoothing, and integrate VWAP for enhanced liquidity and trend measures.
Adjust window sizes, use adaptive smoothing, and balance factor components for improved signal responsiveness and robustness.
Use EMA for smoother indicators, combine factors thoughtfully, and handle NaN values.
Adjust window sizes, incorporate liquidity measures, and consider adaptive smoothing for better factor performance.
Incorporate more dynamic and adaptive features, reduce complexity, and ensure factors are uncorrelated.
Incorporate adaptive windows, liquidity measures, and adjust for market conditions.
Consider shorter volatility windows, responsive EMA, and additional long-term reversion signals for enhanced factor sensitivity.
Consider shorter periods, adaptive spans, and incorporate liquidity measures like MFI for enhanced factor robustness.
Incorporate adaptive windows, multiple RSI periods, and VWAP for more dynamic and responsive alpha factors.
Use adaptive windows, shorter periods for responsiveness, and combine multiple RSI for robustness.
