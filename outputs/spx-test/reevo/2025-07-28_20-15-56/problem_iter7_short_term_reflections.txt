Incorporate adaptive metrics, reduce lags, and integrate more robust sentiment and liquidity measures for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate MFI, use shorter momentum periods, and adjust volatility windows for more responsive and robust alpha factors.
Incorporate adaptive windows, use EMA for smoothing, and combine multiple momentum and volatility measures.
Simplify calculations, avoid over-smoothing, and use direct indicators for clearer signals.
Consider shorter momentum, dual EMA smoothing, and combining short-term with long-term factors for enhanced alpha.
Shorter momentum, mid-term volatility, and integrating market sentiment with price-to-volume ratio improves alpha factor.
Incorporate more technical indicators, use longer-term trends, and normalize factors for better stability and interpretability.
Incorporate more sophisticated momentum, volume, and volatility measures, and consider factor normalization.
Incorporate more sophisticated momentum, volatility, and volume indicators. Use weighted combinations and consider additional sentiment and trend measures.
Incorporate macroeconomic indicators, use machine learning for feature selection, and apply adaptive weighting.
