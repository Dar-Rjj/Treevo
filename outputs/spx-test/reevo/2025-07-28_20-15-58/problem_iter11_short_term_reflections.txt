Consider incorporating relative strength, sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators for more robust heuristics.
Focus on dynamic weighting, adaptive volatility, and exponential moving averages for smoother, more responsive factors.
Incorporate longer-term trends, adjust factor weights, and explore different volatility measures for robustness.
Integrate adaptive windows, dynamic weights, and log returns for more robust and responsive alpha factors.
Use EMA for smoother trends, integrate more diverse factors, and refine dynamic weighting.
Simplify with moving averages, dynamically adjust weights, and consider market conditions for adaptive volatility.
Incorporate adaptive volatility, dynamic factor weighting, and use logarithmic returns for more robust alpha generation.
Use exponential moving averages for smoother trends and incorporate absolute values for dynamic weighting.
Incorporate adaptive windows, dynamic weighting, and use of EMA for smoother trend representation.
Simplify, use logarithmic returns, adaptive volatility, and dynamically weighted factors for improved interpretability and performance.
