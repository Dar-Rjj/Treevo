Integrate more diverse indicators, use adaptive windows, and incorporate market sentiment for enhanced factor robustness.
Use exponential moving averages, adaptive volatility, and dynamic factor weighting for more responsive and robust alpha signals.
Incorporate EMA for smoother trends, add market sentiment, and balance dynamic weights for robust factor integration.
Incorporate EMA for smoother trends, use market sentiment, and experiment with different window sizes and adaptive weightings.
Use EMA for smoother trends, adapt volatility with momentum, and combine factors with dynamic weighting.
Incorporate more sentiment, use adaptive windows, and blend with different moving averages for smoother trends.
Use EMAs for smoother trends, simplify factor combinations, and focus on dynamic weighting and adaptive volatility.
Use exponential moving averages for smoother trend following, and consider additional factors like RSI or MACD for robustness.
Simplify factor combinations, focus on robustness, and avoid over-adjusting for recent trends.
Consider using both moving and exponential averages, and adjust factor weights based on recent market volatility.
