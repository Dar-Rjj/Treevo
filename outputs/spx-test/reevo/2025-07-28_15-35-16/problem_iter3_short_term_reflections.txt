Incorporate volume, use relative strength, and consider volatility for more robust alpha factors.
Incorporate price volatility, use more robust normalization, and consider additional market indicators for enhanced factors.
Incorporate price trends, volume, and volatility; use multi-period analysis for robustness.
Incorporate volume, gap, and volatility; use weighted metrics and combine multiple factors for robustness.
Normalize changes, consider price range, and avoid overcomplicating factors for better predictive performance.
Incorporate multiple time frames, use exponential smoothing, and combine price and volume for more robust signals.
Incorporate volatility, use exponential moving averages, and consider multi-day price patterns for more robust factors.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and liquidity. Use shorter time frames, combine price levels, and normalize by volume or standard deviation.
Integrate volatility, incorporate trading volume, and refine momentum for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate more price action, momentum, and volatility. Use advanced statistical methods and consider external market data.
