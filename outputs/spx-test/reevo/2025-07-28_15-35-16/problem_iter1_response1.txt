```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the closing price and the average of high and low prices
    close_price = df['close']
    avg_high_low = (df['high'] + df['low']) / 2
    
    # Compute a momentum factor based on the change in the close price over two periods
    momentum_factor = df['close'].pct_change(periods=2)
    
    # Integrate the difference and momentum into a new alpha factor
    alpha_factor = (close_price - avg_high_low) * momentum_factor
    
    return alpha_factor
