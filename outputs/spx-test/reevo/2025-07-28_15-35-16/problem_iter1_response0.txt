```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between today's close and yesterday's close
    df['close_change'] = df['close'] - df['close'].shift(1)
    
    # Calculate the average volume over the past 5 days
    df['avg_volume_5d'] = df['volume'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    
    # Alpha factor: (Close Change / Average 5-Day Volume) * High/Low Ratio
    alpha_factor = (df['close_change'] / df['avg_volume_5d']) * (df['high'] / df['low'])
    return alpha_factor
```
