Incorporate more price dynamics, use volume-weighted measures, and consider intraday volatility for enhanced alpha factor.
Consider trend and momentum, use rolling windows, and balance price and volume impacts.

Incorporate relative strength, adjust for liquidity, and normalize by volatility for robust, interpretable factors.
Incorporate volatility, momentum, and volume with multi-period analysis for more robust and dynamic factors.
Incorporate multi-period analysis, use rolling statistics, and combine price and volume indicators for enhanced factor stability.
Integrate more market dynamics, use diverse time windows, and combine multiple technical indicators for richer signals.
Incorporate momentum, volatility, and liquidity measures; use longer or adaptive windows; consider price and volume together.
Incorporate volatility, leverage candlestick patterns, and consider market depth for enhanced factor robustness.
Incorporate more price/volume features, use rolling statistics, and consider market microstructure for richer alpha signals.
