Incorporate seasonality, use machine learning, and consider macroeconomic indicators for enhanced predictive power.
Combine EWMA for recent trends, RSI for momentum, and ATR for volatility, with dynamic volume adjustments.
Use exponential smoothing, focus on short-term momentum, and integrate volume dynamics for more responsive factors.
Incorporate multiple time frames, additional technical indicators, and sentiment for a more robust and dynamic factor.
Incorporate adaptive indicators, dynamic volume ratios, and multi-period analysis for enhanced factor robustness.
Consider seasonality, external factors, and machine learning for dynamic factor weighting.
Incorporate more sophisticated trend and mean-reversion signals, and refine dynamic weighting with advanced statistical measures.
Incorporate more dynamic elements, use adaptive windows, and consider inter-market relationships for improved heuristics.
Use exponential weighting, focus on key indicators, balance momentum and mean reversion, and simplify factor combinations.
Use exponential weighting, incorporate volume trends, and balance between momentum and mean reversion carefully.
