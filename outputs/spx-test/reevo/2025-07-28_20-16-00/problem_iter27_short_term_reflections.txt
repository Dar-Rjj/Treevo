Shorter EMA, reduced window for weighted return, and dynamic volume ratios improve responsiveness and accuracy.
Consider shorter timeframes, adaptive EMAs, and incorporate trend-following signals for improved responsiveness and predictive power.
Adjust EMA spans, incorporate adaptive lookbacks, and smooth factors for stability.
Consider shorter EMA spans, multi-period analysis, and incorporate long-term sentiment for robustness.
Consider trend strength, integrate fundamental data, and use machine learning for non-linear relationships.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and balance short- and long-term sentiments for clearer signals.
Incorporate adaptive lookbacks, smooth factors, and integrate macroeconomic indicators for stability and responsiveness.
Shorten EMA spans, incorporate multi-period momentum, and leverage sector-specific data for more reactive and nuanced factors.
Incorporate diverse time frames, use sector-specific data, and balance momentum with mean reversion signals.
Reduce EMA span, focus on short-term momentum, simplify factors, and integrate longer-term trends for stability.
