```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between the closing price of today and the opening price of yesterday
    price_diff = df['close'] - df['open'].shift(1)
    
    # Calculate the average trading volume over the last 5 days
    avg_volume = df['volume'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    
    # Alpha factor: weighted difference by the average volume
    alpha_factor = (price_diff / (avg_volume + 1e-7))
    
    return alpha_factor
