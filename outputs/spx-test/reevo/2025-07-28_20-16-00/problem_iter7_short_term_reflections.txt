Incorporate volatility, trend, and momentum with volume-weighted returns for a robust and dynamic alpha factor.
Incorporate multi-period momentum, use ATR for volatility, and adjust for volume changes.
Incorporate relative strength, use adaptive windows, and integrate macroeconomic indicators for improved factor robustness.
Incorporate adaptive volatility, multi-period momentum, and volume shocks for more robust alpha factor generation.
Incorporate trend strength, use dynamic weights, and consider smoothing techniques for more robust alpha factors.
Integrate volatility, volume changes, and true range with momentum for more robust alpha factors.
Increase weighting on recent data, use ATR for volatility, and refine true range calculation.
Consider shorter trends, refined true range, and leverage dynamic volume ratios for more responsive and adaptive alpha factors.
Incorporate more trend and volume indicators, use adaptive windows, and consider market regimes.
Integrate more complex indicators, optimize window sizes, and consider market sentiment for improved factor robustness.
