Use adaptive indicators, focus on key trends, and integrate sentiment for enhanced predictive power.
Use exponential weighting, focus on recent data, and simplify factor combinations for clearer signals.
Combine short and long-term indicators, use EWM for smoothing, and incorporate volume trends for enhanced signal.
Leverage exponential smoothing, focus on recent data, and combine fewer, more impactful factors.
Combine multiple time frames, use SMA for trends, and weigh different momentum periods.
Incorporate macroeconomic indicators, use adaptive window sizes, and consider inter-market relationships for enhanced factor robustness.
Consider integrating more sophisticated momentum measures and adaptive volatility calculations.
Use EMA for responsiveness, combine fewer, more impactful factors, and leverage volume dynamics.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and use exponential weighting for more recent data relevance.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and ensure dynamic adjustments. Avoid overcomplication and maintain interpretability.
