Incorporate sector trends, use consistent time frames, and balance components for more stable and predictive factors.
Incorporate more dynamic indicators, like slope and percentage change, and consider multi-period analysis for richer signals.
Incorporate sector trends, use longer-term indicators, and consider additional market sentiment metrics for robustness.
Incorporate longer-term trends, enhance sector-specific analysis, and refine volatility and momentum measures.
Incorporate sector-specific and macroeconomic indicators, and refine factor weighting for better predictive power.
Incorporate adaptive lookbacks, smooth factors, and consider integrating more macroeconomic indicators for robustness.
Adjust time windows, integrate macro and sector indicators, and balance trend and volatility components.
Consider shorter EMA spans, incorporate macro and sector indicators, and balance with volatility and volume trends.
Adjust time frames, incorporate sector analysis, and refine momentum with shorter EMAs for improved reactivity.
Incorporate sector-specific trends, use volume-weighted returns, and consider multi-period momentum for enhanced predictive power.
