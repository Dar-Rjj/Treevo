```python
def heuristics_v2(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    # Calculate the difference between high and low, to gauge the day's volatility
    daily_volatility = df['high'] - df['low']
    
    # Calculate a simple moving average for the close price over 5 days as a basic trend indicator
    sma_5 = df['close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    
    # Determine if today's close is above the 5-day SMA, indicating an upward momentum
    momentum = (df['close'] > sma_5).astype(int)
    
    # Create a factor combining volatility (as inverse, higher volatility might lead to reversion) and momentum
    factor = (1 / (daily_volatility + 1e-7)) * momentum
    
    return factor
