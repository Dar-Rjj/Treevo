Incorporate trend strength, use dynamic lookback periods, and integrate sentiment or external data for enhanced predictive power.
Incorporate adaptive indicators, multi-period momentum, and volume shocks for more robust and dynamic alpha factor generation.
Integrate sector-specific metrics, sentiment analysis, and machine learning models for dynamic factor weighting.
Integrate more adaptive and dynamic indicators, focus on volume-weighted returns, and balance trend with mean reversion.
Incorporate more dynamic weighting, use relative strength, and integrate volume and volatility more effectively.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and balance between momentum and mean reversion.
Incorporate more dynamic weighting, use multiple time frames, and blend various technical indicators for robustness.
Combine adaptive volatility, refined momentum, and smart volume adjustments for enhanced predictive alpha.
Simplify calculations, focus on key indicators, and avoid overcomplicating the factor with too many components.
Incorporate volatility clustering, use exponential smoothing, and consider liquidity and market sentiment factors.
