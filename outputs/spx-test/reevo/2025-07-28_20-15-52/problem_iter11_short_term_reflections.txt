Consider integrating momentum, mean reversion, and liquidity factors; use adaptive windows for more dynamic analysis.
Integrate diverse timeframes, use normalized indicators, and consider momentum and relative strength for robust alpha generation.
Incorporate momentum, RSI, and volatility adjustments; consider sector-specific factors and market conditions.
Incorporate momentum, mean reversion, and volatility adjustments with adaptive weights.
Incorporate more short-term dynamics, use relative strength, and integrate volume-weighted returns for enhanced factor performance.
Integrate more sophisticated trend, momentum, and mean reversion signals. Consider seasonality and macroeconomic data.
Simplify, focus on key indicators, and ensure factors are uncorrelated for robustness.
Incorporate volatility, trend, and momentum with smoother indicators; balance with volume and relative strength for robust factors.
Incorporate momentum, volume trends, and volatility normalization; use longer-term returns for stability.
Integrate diverse time frames, use relative ratios, and incorporate long-term trends for more robust alpha factors.
